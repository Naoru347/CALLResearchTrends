W., Liu, S., Ok, D. U., Park, J., Parrish, C., Sardegna, V. G.","description":"Although educators are excited about the potential of social network sites for language learning (SNSLL), there is a lack of understanding of how SNSLL can be used to facilitate teaching and learning for English as Second language (ESL) instructors and students. The purpose of this study was to examine the affordances of four selected SNSLL (LingQ, Lang-8, italki, and Polyglotclub) through site design and user experience from two perspectives: using the sites as a language teacher through site analyses; and using the sites as a language learner through usability testing. The findings showed that these sites have the potential to facilitate language learning. The learning tasks created using the social networking features of these sites are to provide examples of how to use these SNSLL as teaching tools under a socio-constructivist learning framework. In addition, the results of the usability testing highlighted the importance of considering the website's information, interface, and interaction designs. SNSLL should be as easy to use and as intuitive to navigate as possible. We hope the findings will provide valuable insights regarding how SNSLL can be used as teaching and learning tools, and how they should be designed to facilitate pedagogical goals.","subject":"Social Media, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Language Teachers, Usability, Web Sites, Teaching Methods, Web 2.0 Technologies, Teacher Attitudes, College Students, Questionnaires, Program Effectiveness, Use Studies, Video Technology, Student Attitudes","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143740","title":"A Taxonomy of Vocabulary Learning Strategies Used in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games","author":"Bytheway, Julie","description":"Initiated in response to informal reports of vocabulary gains from gamers at universities in New Zealand and the Netherlands, this qualitative study explored how English language learners autonomously learn vocabulary while playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Using research processes inherent in Grounded Theory, data was collected from a criterion sample of six experienced English-as-a-second-language players of World of Warcraft. Data included semi-structured interviews, observations, elicited email texts and extant texts. Data was transcribed, coded, and refined through a cyclic process of constant comparative analysis until patterns emerged. The results revealed 15 vocabulary learning strategies, including noticing frequency of words, recognizing knowledge gaps, selecting words for attention, equating images and actions to words, giving and receiving explanations and feedback, observing players, using words to learn words, reading in-game information, and using Google. This taxonomy of 15 vocabulary learning strategies provides a framework for further research into vocabulary learning strategy taxonomies and autonomous learning in informal digital contexts.","subject":"Teaching Methods, Vocabulary Development, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Computer Games, Computer Simulation, Educational Technology, Semi Structured Interviews, Observation, Coding, Comparative Analysis, Learning Strategies, College Students, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Grounded Theory","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"New Zealand, Netherlands"},{"id":"EJ1143738","title":"Reflexive Photography, Attitudes, Behavior, and CALL: ITAs Improving Spoken English Intelligibility","author":"Wallace, Lara","description":"Research in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has frequently taken a top-down approach when investigating learners' attitudes and behavior, both in the course as well as for their personal use. Suggestions are given for use of technology, and future research (Beatty, 2010; Levy &amp; Stockwell, 2006). One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data. The findings revealed valuable insights through the eyes of the learners regarding what technology the learners found to be helpful and\/or obstructive, both in the course as well as for their personal use, and suggestions for improvements in use of technology are given. Finally, future research directions in CALL using reflexive photography are discussed.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Educational Technology, Photography, Reflection, Teaching Assistants, Foreign Students, Graduate Students, Phenomenology, Student Attitudes, Qualitative Research","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143615","title":"Eye Movements of Online Chinese Learners","author":"Stickler, Ursula, Shi, Lijing","description":"Although online tutorials are becoming commonplace for language teaching, very few studies to date have provided insights into learners' behaviours in synchronous online interactions from their own perspective. This study employs eyetracking technology to investigate ten learners' attention during synchronous online language learning in a multimodal environment. The participants were learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language at beginner's or lower-intermediate level. While learners took part in two different online activities, one focusing on reading, the other on interaction with others, their gaze focus was tracked, and in subsequent stimulated recall interviews the learners reflected on their engagement with the screen and their intentions while reading or speaking online. Our findings show that during reading tasks, when Pinyin transcriptions as well as Chinese characters were presented, all beginner and lower intermediate participants focused to some degree on the Pinyin. In the interactive task learners' gaze was drawn to elements of the screen that were not immediately necessary for technical or linguistic reasons but that could be interpreted as containing social presence information, e.g. names listed and emoticons employed by other users.","subject":"Eye Movements, Attention, Online Courses, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Interaction, Learning Activities, Interviews, Recall (Psychology), Learner Engagement, Intention, Reading, Chinese, Second Language Learning, Computer Mediated Communication, Synchronous Communication, Adult Learning, Teleconferencing, Questionnaires, Measurement Equipment, Foreign Countries","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"EJ1143730","title":"Using Netnography to Explore the Culture of Online Language Teaching Communities","author":"Kulavuz-Onal, Derya","description":"Netnography (Kozinets, 2010) is an ethnographic approach to study communities that exist primarily online. Engaging in online participant observation, the netnographer connects to the online community through a computer screen, and the field is located inside the screen. Although it has been used in marketing research extensively, netnography is a relatively new methodology in educational research. In this paper, I give an overview of netnography and its applicability in studying online language teaching communities. Drawing upon a netnography of a globally-distributed online community of practice of English language teachers, Webheads in Action, I provide detailed accounts of my experiences during data collection and particular methodological considerations in netnography in order to shed light on the often untold aspects of an ethnographic design in online research that involves participant observation. I conclude with a discussion of possible benefits of a participant observer approach in netnography in understanding the culture of online language teaching communities, and invite CALL researchers to consider netnography and online participant observation in their future studies.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Computer Assisted Instruction, Web Based Instruction, Ethnography, Communities of Practice, Participant Observation, Research Methodology, Educational Research, Language Teachers, English Language Learners, Data Collection, Research Design, Educational Benefits, Computer Mediated Communication, Web 2.0 Technologies, Field Studies, Notetaking, Interviews, Archives","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143614","title":"It Takes Research to Build a Community: Ongoing Challenges for Scholars in Digitally-Supported Communicative Language Teaching","author":"Dooly, Melinda","description":"This article provides an argument for closer multilateral alliances between the emergent and loosely-bound international community of educational researchers who are working in areas related to Digitally Supported Communicative Language Teaching and learning (herein DSCLT). By taking advantage of the communications revolution that is currently reshaping the world, internationally aligned investigators can foster new knowledge, technology, and practices that develop improved teaching strategies and policies appropriate to our rapidly changing times. Beginning with a brief overview of the impact that technology has had on education and post-2000 nascent research areas related to DSCLT, this article goes on to examine whether or not the impact of research is geographically bound, and if so, how transnational alliances can be useful in bridging gaps in the continuum of knowledge-building. Finally, the potential gains that could stem from an enhanced collaboration between international research communities are examined, although admittedly such endeavors are not without challenges.","subject":"Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Communication Skills, Geographic Location, International Cooperation, Computer Mediated Communication, Educational Research, Second Language Instruction, Telecommunications, Handheld Devices, Internet, Social Media, Communities of Practice","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143780","title":"Applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to Explore the Effects of a Course Management System (CMS)-Assisted EFL Writing Instruction","author":"Tsai, Yea-Ru","description":"This study illustrates a teaching model that utilizes a Blackboard (Bb) course management system (CMS) to support English writing instruction. It was implemented in a blended English research paper (RP) writing course, with specific learning resources and activities offered inside and outside the Bb CMS. A quasi-experimental study in which the results of two academic years were analysed is presented. The results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in their final drafts. The research methodology included the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to evaluate the course. The results of the survey showed that most students displayed positive learning outcomes, indicating that the instruction model could contribute to the effectiveness of learning English writing. Major factors influencing the improvement of writing performance included technical support, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude; however, the influence of writing activities on the Bb was limited in comparison to the other variables.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Educational Technology, Writing Instruction, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Integrated Learning Systems, Research Reports, Quasiexperimental Design, Technology Integration, Student Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Undergraduate Students, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Comparative Analysis, Blended Learning, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1176697","title":"Quantitative Considerations for Improving Replicability in CALL and Applied Linguistics","author":"Plonsky, Luke","description":"There are a number of methodological practices commonly employed by CALL researchers that limit progress in the field.

Each study corresponds to and contains a set of methodological issues. Following each study, I address the issues they illustrate, providing comments and suggestions for how the analyses could be modified to produce greater replicability and\/or replicational value.

This case study examines 16 years of cognitive development of two Japanese language teachers practicing computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and the challenges they experienced as a result of the evolution of information and communications technology (ICT). The focus is on the challenges faced by L2 teachers and their responses, and how these challenges relate to the development of teachers' agency as CALL practitioners. Narrative inquiry data for both participants were collected following the Trajectory Equifinality Approach (e.g., Valsiner &amp; Sato, 2006), in which each teacher's life trajectory is visualized to identify critical points based on social affordances and constraints. The critical points were further analyzed and interpreted within and between activity systems. The data suggests that the teachers became aware of the social nature of the technology through the challenges they encountered when coordinating their own and students' mismatched values attached to ICT. Such a change in perceptions not only impacted their pedagogical usage of the technology but in turn also constituted their agency.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Technological Literacy, Empowerment, Japanese, Semi Structured Interviews, Teacher Attitudes, Social Influences, Faculty Development, Case Studies, Qualitative Research, Personal Narratives","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1176699","title":"Input and Output Grammar Instruction in Tutorial CALL with a Complex Grammatical Structure","author":"Collentine, Joseph, Collentine, Karina","description":"Conceptual replication within a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) environment provides an understanding of the generalizability of second language acquisition (SLA) research (Porte, 2013; Smith &amp; Schulze, 2013). The present study replicates Collentine (1998a), a classroom-based experiment framed within a larger discussion on the relative benefits of input- and output-based instruction. Collentine (1998a) compared the benefits of Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 2004) and output-based instruction, both of which elevated the Spanish subjunctive's communicative value. The results showed that input- or output-oriented instruction informed by how learners process grammatical information can affect the acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena. This conceptual replication not only seeks to corroborate the original study's findings in a new learning context. It also tests the finding's generalizability to a tutorial CALL environment built on 3D simulations and emerging web-app technologies. The participants were foreign-language learners of Spanish in a classroom-based curriculum (N = 50). The results indicate that, in the classroom and in a CALL environment, both input- and output-oriented approaches can promote the acquisition of a complex grammatical structure if practice is meaningful (informed by psycholinguistic processing principles) and deliberate, and if feedback is provided.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Educational Technology, Grammar, Teaching Methods, Program Effectiveness, Spanish, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Feedback (Response), Statistical Analysis, Morphology (Languages), Language Proficiency, Cultural Awareness, Interdisciplinary Approach, Sentences, Verbs, Syntax, Regression (Statistics), Pretests Posttests","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143784","title":"Learning L2 Pronunciation with a Mobile Speech Recognizer: French \/y\/","author":"Liakin, Denis, Cardoso, Walcir, Liakina, Natallia","description":"This study investigates the acquisition of the L2 French vowel \/y\/ in a mobile-assisted learning environment, via the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Particularly, it addresses the question of whether ASR-based pronunciation instruction using a mobile device can improve the production and perception of French \/y\/. Forty-two elementary French students participated in an experimental study in which they were assigned to one of three groups: (1) the ASR Group, which used an ASR application on their mobile devices to complete weekly pronunciation activities, with immediate written visual (textual) feedback provided by the software and no human interaction; (2) the Non-ASR Group, which completed the same weekly pronunciation activities in individual weekly sessions but with a teacher who provided immediate oral feedback using recasts and repetitions; and finally, (3) the Control Group, which participated in weekly individual meetings 'to practice their conversation skills' with a teacher who provided no pronunciation feedback. The study followed a pretest\/posttest design. According to the results of the dependent samples t-tests, only the ASR group improved significantly from pretest to posttest (p &lt; 0.001), and none of the groups improved in perception. The overall success of the ASR group on the production measures suggests that this type of learning environment is propitious for the development of segmental features such as \/y\/ in L2 French.","subject":"French, Second Language Learning, Pronunciation, Telecommunications, Handheld Devices, Automation, Teaching Methods, Elementary School Students, Comparative Analysis, Feedback (Response), Computer Software, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Randomized Controlled Trials, Mixed Methods Research, Pretests Posttests, Surveys, Interviews, Foreign Countries","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada (Montreal)"}]
