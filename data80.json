[{"id":"EJ1176699","title":"Input and Output Grammar Instruction in Tutorial CALL with a Complex Grammatical Structure","author":"Collentine, Joseph, Collentine, Karina","description":"Conceptual replication within a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) environment provides an understanding of the generalizability of second language acquisition (SLA) research (Porte, 2013; Smith &amp; Schulze, 2013). The present study replicates Collentine (1998a), a classroom-based experiment framed within a larger discussion on the relative benefits of input- and output-based instruction. Collentine (1998a) compared the benefits of Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 2004) and output-based instruction, both of which elevated the Spanish subjunctive's communicative value. The results showed that input- or output-oriented instruction informed by how learners process grammatical information can affect the acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena. This conceptual replication not only seeks to corroborate the original study's findings in a new learning context. It also tests the finding's generalizability to a tutorial CALL environment built on 3D simulations and emerging web-app technologies. The participants were foreign-language learners of Spanish in a classroom-based curriculum (N = 50). The results indicate that, in the classroom and in a CALL environment, both input- and output-oriented approaches can promote the acquisition of a complex grammatical structure if practice is meaningful (informed by psycholinguistic processing principles) and deliberate, and if feedback is provided.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Educational Technology, Grammar, Teaching Methods, Program Effectiveness, Spanish, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Feedback (Response), Statistical Analysis, Morphology (Languages), Language Proficiency, Cultural Awareness, Interdisciplinary Approach, Sentences, Verbs, Syntax, Regression (Statistics), Pretests Posttests","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1176700","title":"The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same, or Do They? Revisiting Classroom Interaction Approaches and Their Effects on Quantity and Characteristics of Language Production","author":"Jones, Linda C., Murphy, Cheryl A., Holland, Amalie","description":"This study investigated the quantity and characteristics of student language production, discourse functions, and morphosyntactic features in three different discourse settings--face-to-face (F2F), lab-setting chatroom interactions (Lab), and any place\/any device chatroom interactions (APAD). Discourse was examined through the replication and extension of Richard Kern's (1995) study. Similarities in findings between the two studies included a continuation of incomplete, and short sentence lengths among F2F students, an absence of F2F greetings, and a higher rate of assertions, verb tenses, and simple sentences in the Lab setting. Differences included a higher rate of F2F turns in the current study, an absence of greetings in the lab setting, and a greater number of commands among F2F participants. Findings underscored what Kern previously asserted: that F2F and chatroom settings tend to encourage and support slightly different goals associated with language discourse. Kern stated that more sophisticated conversation occurred in the chatroom setting. Current findings concurred but furthered that more conversational interaction took place within the F2F discourse setting due to a greater number of commands, turns, and incomplete sentences. Similarly, F2F students experienced greater input due to the increase of words heard, questions asked, and commands made.","subject":"Interaction, Synchronous Communication, Statistical Analysis, Language Acquisition, Computer Mediated Communication, Comparative Analysis, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Handheld Devices, French, Intervention, Student Surveys, College Students, Statistical Significance","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143785","title":"Conversation Analysis in Computer-Assisted Language Learning","author":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Lloret, Marta","description":"The use of Conversation Analysis (CA) in the study of technology-mediated interactions is a recent methodological addition to qualitative research in the field of Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL). The expansion of CA in Second Language Acquisition research, coupled with the need for qualitative techniques to explore how people interact in technology-mediated environments, has stimulated a small but growing body of research. This article reviews CALL research that employed a CA approach to the collection, microanalysis, and understanding of the data in a variety of technology-mediated fields (text, audio and video SCMC, email, forums and bulletin boards, social networks, and games), with participants from different contexts and languages, interacting in an L2 either among themselves or with native\/more expert speakers of the language. Most research up to now has been descriptive in nature, illustrating the sequential organization of interaction, interactional and linguistic resources employed by the participants, and affordances and challenges of the media to promote language learning. In addition, a few studies have directly explored &quot;learning&quot; through the microanalysis of longitudinal data for any changes in the learners' linguistic and interactional patterns of engagement. The review of studies is followed by those challenges that affect the implementation of CA in CALL research and a vision of the future of CA for CALL in the larger field of Applied Linguistics.","subject":"Discourse Analysis, Computer Mediated Communication, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Qualitative Research, Data Analysis, Program Implementation, Educational Research, Applied Linguistics, Sequential Approach, Affordances, Longitudinal Studies, Concept Formation","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1143784","title":"Learning L2 Pronunciation with a Mobile Speech Recognizer: French \/y\/","author":"Liakin, Denis, Cardoso, Walcir, Liakina, Natallia","description":"This study investigates the acquisition of the L2 French vowel \/y\/ in a mobile-assisted learning environment, via the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Particularly, it addresses the question of whether ASR-based pronunciation instruction using a mobile device can improve the production and perception of French \/y\/. Forty-two elementary French students participated in an experimental study in which they were assigned to one of three groups: (1) the ASR Group, which used an ASR application on their mobile devices to complete weekly pronunciation activities, with immediate written visual (textual) feedback provided by the software and no human interaction; (2) the Non-ASR Group, which completed the same weekly pronunciation activities in individual weekly sessions but with a teacher who provided immediate oral feedback using recasts and repetitions; and finally, (3) the Control Group, which participated in weekly individual meetings 'to practice their conversation skills' with a teacher who provided no pronunciation feedback. The study followed a pretest\/posttest design. According to the results of the dependent samples t-tests, only the ASR group improved significantly from pretest to posttest (p &lt; 0.001), and none of the groups improved in perception. The overall success of the ASR group on the production measures suggests that this type of learning environment is propitious for the development of segmental features such as \/y\/ in L2 French.","subject":"French, Second Language Learning, Pronunciation, Telecommunications, Handheld Devices, Automation, Teaching Methods, Elementary School Students, Comparative Analysis, Feedback (Response), Computer Software, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Randomized Controlled Trials, Mixed Methods Research, Pretests Posttests, Surveys, Interviews, Foreign Countries","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada (Montreal)"}]
