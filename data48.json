After a brief presentation of the pedagogical and technological backgrounds, the system is described. Central results of a series of pilots in autumn 2013 with around 100 upper secondary pupils are described and further steps are discussed. The results are highly promising, and the concept was highly appreciated by the pupils regardless of some technical problems that the prototype had during the pilots. The researcher observations and the questionnaire results show that the concept manages to create a new motivating collaborative learning context with clear added value compared with equal tasks realized in a typical classroom approach.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Questionnaires, Secondary School Students, Cooperative Learning, Teaching Methods, Oral Language, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Instructional Innovation, Educational Games, German, Foreign Countries, Feedback (Response), Multivariate Analysis, Observation","source":"Journal of Educational Technology Systems","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Finland"},{"id":"EJ1120967","title":"Do Young Learners Exploit the Same Learning Strategies as Adults?","author":"Hrozkov\u00e1, Ivana","description":"Learning strategies are considered to be one of the key factors affecting the learning process, its effectiveness and study results.

With learner attitudes in mind, we developed online modules for beginning Korean and Japanese courses. In this article, we report the survey results and the process of developing these innovative blended and online modalities of content delivery, focusing on the strengths of the modules and the unforeseen development challenges. The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-\/copresence are explored.

The image seems more appropriate than the text when trying to communicate easy and quickly. The speech calls for articulated language, expressed through a symbolic set of oral or written codes that we must master. Understanding an image requires less work and fewer skills than reading a text. This paper aims to highlight how messages are perceived and received within the educational activities, through the two types of communication, iconic and logical-linguistic. The instrument used in conducting the research was represented by a questionnaire consisting from objective and subjective items, applied to students from high schools in Oradea. Besides these questionnaires, a key role in the study was played by the knowledge gained while observing lessons held by students of the University of Oradea within their teaching placement, as well as while supervising teachers from secondary educational institutions in the process of obtaining teacher certification level 1.

This study examined learning styles and the perceived benefits of analogical problem construction on SQL knowledge acquisition. The data collected from 80 participants suggests there is a perceived positive benefit to using analogical problem construction for learning introductory database concepts. The learning style of the majority of students in the sample is &quot;Active-Sensing-Visual-Sequential.&quot; However, learning styles were not related to student perceived impact of analogical problem construction to understand database concepts.

While the benefits of these systems are easy to describe, students, especially those without business experience, have difficulty appreciating how these systems are used to improve the efficiency of business operations. This paper reports on a project to provide experiential learning to beginning business students. We focus on open-source enterprise and process management systems to investigate whether the benefits can be provided even by small institutions and without a large investment into commercial systems. The results of experimental studies are provided and suggest that hands-on learning on open-source systems can lead to improved learning outcomes. The main contribution is the demonstration that educators need not shy away from experiential learning when faced with the obstacles that large-scale commercial enterprise systems may present, but can instead choose a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach of easily integrating enterprise systems into the curriculum to benefit student learning.","subject":"Outcomes of Education, Experiential Learning, Management Systems, Business Administration Education, Open Source Technology, Efficiency, Small Businesses, Teaching Methods, Curriculum Design, Undergraduate Students, Foreign Countries, Statistical Analysis, Scores, Pretests Posttests, Factor Analysis","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada"},{"id":"EJ1137365","title":"A Project Management Approach to Applying Best Practices to Online CS\/MIS Experiential Learning Projects","author":"Schwieger, Dana, Surendran, Ken","description":"The value of experiential learning projects (which are usually major assessments in courses) in education has been touted since the early 1900s (Dewey, 1938).

However, they often require a significant amount of additional effort beyond that required of assigning conventional homework problems. When the projects take place in an online course setting, the level of complexity subsequently increases. Valuing the overall contribution of such projects, in light of their additional instructor and course costs, can be difficult. Such valuations are further complicated with the measures being subjective. In 1992, Drs. Robert Kaplan and David Norton published an article in Harvard Business Review detailing a model for measuring the effect of multiple perspectives, both financial and subjective, on business performance (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992). The Balanced Scorecard approach provides both an internal (process based) and external (outcomes based) standpoint to evaluating an organization utilizing four perspectives: (1) Learning and Growth, (2) Business Process, (3) Customer and (4) Financial (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1996). With its thorough approach to evaluating objective and subjective measures of business performance, the model serves as a potential framework for use in the educational setting. In this article, the author developed and applied a modified version of Kaplan and Norton's Balanced Scorecard model to evaluate the value generated by a service learning project in an online course.","subject":"Service Learning, Instructional Effectiveness, Online Courses, Student Projects, Models, Outcomes of Education, Management Information Systems, Experiential Learning, College Students, Student Evaluation","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Missouri"},{"id":"EJ1137335","title":"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Self-Created Student Screencasts as a Tool to Increase Student Learning Outcomes in a Hands-On Computer Programming Course","author":"Powell, Loreen M., Wimmer, Hayden","description":"Computer programming is challenging to teach and difficult for students to learn.

Where undergraduate IS students once may have practiced modeling in analysis, design, and implementation across six or more courses in a curriculum using a variety of languages and tools they commonly now experience modeling in four or fewer courses in at most a couple of paradigms. And in most of these courses their modeling decisions focus on acceptable syntax rather than principles representing and communicating concepts of quality in information systems. Where learning design quality may once have been an osmotic side effect of development practice it must now be a conscious goal in pedagogy if it is to be taught at all. This paper presents a learning unit that teaches design quality in object-oriented models. The focus on object-oriented models allows the learning to permeate analysis, design, and implementation enriching pedagogy across the systems development life cycle. The quality perspective presented is more expansive than that usually found in software engineering, the traditional &quot;objective&quot; notion of metrics, and integrates aspects of aesthetics, the more subjective phenomena of satisfaction.

These constructs were measured in a survey, except for learning, which was measured by grades. Gamification of the LMS included the addition of all of the following: (1) An illustrated hero's adventure storyline with monsters to overcome by completing quests (assignments and assessments), (2) Olympic colored badges to represent individual grades as well as overall progress, (3) Points earned on a game-like scale--e.g., 100,000 points for the course, (4) A leaderboard with anonymous names and avatars, (5) Lives which allowed students to turn in a fixed number of late assignments without penalty. While open-ended responses suggested that students appreciated some gamification aspects, the quantitative data suggested that gamification has virtually no effect on the constructs measured. Only relatedness (a sub-construct of motivation) and student interest were found to be significant, although with small effect sizes. This study contributes to existing literature by exploring the impact of gamification of an LMS for a required introductory course in information systems.","subject":"Integrated Learning Systems, Games, Student Interests, Student Motivation, Student Satisfaction, Learning, Student Attitudes, Student Surveys, Grades (Scholastic), Self Determination, College Students, Business Administration Education, Personal Autonomy, Competence, Interpersonal Relationship, Pretests Posttests","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1084406","title":"Open Source Meets Virtual Reality--An Instructor's Journey Unearths New Opportunities for Learning, Community, and Academia","author":"O'Connor, Eileen A.","description":"Opening with the history, recent advances, and emerging ways to use avatar-based virtual reality, an instructor who has used virtual environments since 2007 shares how these environments bring more options to community building, teaching, and education.

When teaching the skills needed to determine requirements, it is important to recreate a realistic environment to develop analytical thinking skills. To address this, we developed a simulation for students to learn requirements gathering and analysis where they experience the requirements by operating a fictitious manufacturing firm. The students manage and operate the company, taking on a variety of employee roles from the physical &quot;manufacturing&quot; to the order-taking to the purchasing of component parts. With this pedagogical approach, students deal with the messiness of the problem by drawing on their own experience working in the manufacturing firm, making assumptions, and having the opportunity to verify their assumptions and analyses by working with their classmates.

Most database textbooks have small &quot;toy&quot; databases that are chapter objective specific, and thus do not support application over the complete domain of design, implementation and management concepts across a single database. The Northwind Traders sample database is available by Microsoft for download and use in Microsoft Access, and illustrates transactional processing for a fictitious company that imports (purchases) and exports (sells) specialty foods from around the world. The database contains sample tables, queries, forms, reports, Macros, VBA Class Objects, functions and modules, and other database features. Although the primary purpose for the database is to serve as an illustrative design template for students and practitioners, unfortunately the database and business processes are largely undocumented. This paper attempts to more completely document the business processes, including establishing business rules, describing relationships and participations, and discusses some problems with the existing design. Following understanding of the database and associated business processes, this paper can be used as both a teaching tool and a guide for practitioners using the Northwind Traders sample database as a design template. Additionally, it has been used successfully to introduce the concept of business processes and mapping them in an underlying database in introductory ERP courses.","subject":"Databases, Media Adaptation, Database Design, Database Management Systems, Computer Science Education, Instructional Materials","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1121026","title":"The Impact of Pedagogical Agent on Learners' Motivation and Academic Success","author":"Dincer, Serkan, Doganay, Ahmet","description":"Pedagogical agent is generally described as educational programs that guide, motivate learners while encouraging them during learning by providing feedback. The tasks (informative, guiding, or friend, etc.) and types (human-like, cartoon character, audio, text, etc.) of these modules can be classified based on various variables. Although computer-assisted instruction software is commonly used as a teaching material, research on modules integrated on such programs is scarce. Studies in the field have revealed that such computer-assisted instruction programs increase motivation of learners. In order to keep motivation levels high, these programs need to be adopted depending on the individual needs. Therefore, it can be beneficial to integrate software designed that can be personalized. In this respect, the present study was conducted with secondary school students to identify the impact of pedagogical agent on learners' academic success and motivation. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed. The first group received education via fixed pedagogical agent, the second group had the option to choose among several pedagogical agents, the third group received the education without pedagogical agent and finally the last group received the same education through traditional (non-computer) way. This four-week program was introduced to students via MS Excel program and the data was gathered as pre- and post-test method. The findings have revealed that interfaces impacted motivation and accordingly academic success in a positive way. As a result of the study, it is suggested that learners should be provided programs that can be personalized depending on learners' needs and preferences.","subject":"Student Motivation, Academic Achievement, Computer Assisted Instruction, Pretests Posttests, Pilot Projects, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Statistical Analysis, Secondary School Students, Grade 5, Grade 8","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
