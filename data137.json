[{"id":"EJ1051678","title":"New Software to Help EFL Students Self-Correct Their Writing","author":"Lawley, Jim","description":"This paper describes the development of web-based software at a university in Spain to help students of EFL self-correct their free-form writing. The software makes use of an eighty-million-word corpus of English known to be correct as a normative corpus for error correction purposes. It was discovered that bigrams (two-word combinations of words) present in a student's writing but which are not found, or which are suspiciously rare, in the normative corpus are likely to contain errors. The program highlights such bigrams in compositions, and guidance is provided to help students decide if they have indeed made a mistake, and if so, how to correct it. A cohort of students who volunteered to trial the software for a month reported positively on their experience; it had helped them find mistakes in their own and their peers' writing and had greatly accelerated the self-correction process.","subject":"Computer Software, Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), Error Correction, Foreign Countries, College Students, Writing (Composition), Computational Linguistics, Student Attitudes, Action Research, Distance Education, Online Courses, Interviews, Grammar","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Spain"},{"id":"EJ1063777","title":"A Meta-Synthesis of Empirical Research on the Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) in SLA","author":"Lin, Huifen","description":"This meta-analysis reports the results of a systematic synthesis of primary studies on the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in second language acquisition (SLA) for the period 2000-2012. By extracting information on 21 features from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for instructional\/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger groups or no grouping.

Furthermore, foreign\/second language teachers have expressed a desire for more and better professional development opportunities in that area (Beaven, Emke, Ernest, Germain-Rutherford, Hampel, Hopkins, Stanojevic &amp; Stickler, 2010; Digedu, 2014; Kessler, 2006). Given the continuing and new challenges for CALL teacher education, this special issue of &quot;Language Learning &amp; Technology&quot; on CALL teacher education further speaks to its importance for our field and ultimately our students. To advance our understanding of CALL teacher education, the main goal for this issue is to move beyond research on teacher beliefs and attitudes to investigate actual practices and competencies, especially from a longitudinal perspective, that traces teachers&apos; development. The current issue brings together a collection of articles that represents a wide variety of contexts, formats, foci, and research methods. This variety is particularly important given the highly contextualized nature of teaching and learning (Freeman &amp; Johnson, 1998) and the different needs of pre-service and in-service teachers (Beaven et al., 2010).","subject":"Teacher Education, Faculty Development, Language Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Educational Technology, Teacher Competencies, Educational Practices","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1063806","title":"The Practices and Challenges of Telecollaboration in Higher Education in Europe","author":"Helm, Francesca","description":"Telecollaboration is an area of CALL research and practice which has developed considerably in the last twenty years. Many research studies have been carried out and important findings have been made, but there has not yet been a large scale survey to try and &quot;map&quot; the state of the art in telecollaboration practice. Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to how to meet these challenges and how telecollaboration practice could become mainstreamed in higher education.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Videoconferencing, Surveys, Educational Practices, Teacher Attitudes, Barriers, College Faculty, Language Teachers, Teaching Methods, Positive Attitudes, Time Management, Technical Support, Teacher Student Relationship, College Students, Computer Mediated Communication, Cooperative Learning, Foreign Countries, Profiles, Questionnaires, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1051684","title":"Promoting Pre-Service Teachers' Reflections through a Cross-Cultural Keypal Project","author":"Wach, Aleksandra","description":"This paper reports the results of an action research-based study that investigated participants' reflections on EFL learning and teaching in a computer-mediated communication (CMC)-based project.

A 2-iteration action research lasting for one semester was conducted to evaluate the effects of virtual contexts on learners' EFL learning. 132 elementary school students participated in this study. Both qualitative and quantitative data, including observation and English learning performances, were collected and analyzed. The positive results obtained from the study approved that the usage of virtual contexts in EFL learning could (1) provide students with learning opportunities without the time and space limits, (2) provide students with a game-liked scenario for English learning, and (3) enhance learners' EFL performances.

This study employs a situated learning approach to teacher training and explores what online teaching skills emerge in the process of collaborative situated learning, how these skills develop, and whether collaborative situated learning is an effective method of training instructors to teach in 3D VWs. Six English as a second language (ESL) teacher trainees enrolled in the Teaching English as a Second\/Foreign Language (TES\/FL) program participated in the study. During the preteaching stage, teacher trainees developed language tasks to implement during the teaching stage with eight EFL students in 3D VWs. Blackboard wikis used for designing tasks allowed for observing the acquisition of five 3D-specific, integrated skills. The analysis of teaching sessions recorded through screen capturing software Camtasia Relay in conjunction with the teacher trainees' wikis and journals demonstrates that for this group of teachers, a situated learning approach was an effective method of teacher training.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Teacher Education, Educational Technology, Virtual Classrooms, Online Courses, Teaching Skills, Cooperative Learning, Skill Development, Preservice Teachers, Technology Uses in Education, Computer Software, Web Sites, Web 2.0 Technologies, Context Effect, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Content Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada, Turkey"},{"id":"EJ1051726","title":"From TPACK-in-Action Workshops to Classrooms: CALL Competency Developed and Integrated","author":"Tai, Shu-Ju Diana","description":"This study investigated the impact of a CALL teacher education workshop guided by the TPACK-in-Action model (Tai, 2013).

Participants were 24 elementary English teachers in Taiwan. The study used a mixed methods design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007), collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data concurrently but separately before they were triangulated. Findings show that the TPACK-in-Action workshops had a positive impact on the 24 teachers. In addition to the development of CALL competency, it was also observed that participants demonstrated CALL competency in their teaching, such as selecting online materials and appropriate technology for content teaching, using cloud computing for student interaction, and matching the affordances of technology to meet their instructional goals and pedagogy. In sum, the study provides empirical evidence and a new perspective in the investigation of CALL teacher education.

Drawing on Beach's (2003) conceptualization of transfer as &quot;consequential transition,&quot; this qualitative study seeks a cross-contextual understanding of language teacher learning with digital technology as the teachers in this study moved from a CTE course back to their own teaching contexts. Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching. These results challenge the view that transfer in CTE must be about using technology. It is suggested that a focus on critical reflection of technology use may encourage teachers to continue reflective engagement in the ever-changing and complicated digital learning and teaching context.","subject":"Language Teachers, Teacher Education Programs, Praxis, Theory Practice Relationship, Transfer of Training, Interviews, Followup Studies, Graduate Surveys, Technology Uses in Education, Achievement Gains, Sociocultural Patterns, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Educational Practices, Learning Experience, Multimedia Instruction, Multimedia Materials, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Inservice Teacher Education, Graduate Students, Comparative Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Transcripts (Written Records), Technological Literacy, Technology Education, Teaching Methods, Teaching Skills, Foreign Countries, Educational Technology, Qualitative Research, Computer Assisted Instruction","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1075828","title":"Using Facebook to Promote Korean EFL Learners' Intercultural Competence","author":"Jin, Seunghee","description":"Foreign language learners often have limited opportunity to interact with people from the target culture and develop their intercultural competence (IC) through those interactions both inside and outside of the classroom. To identify a new opportunity to engage Korean EFL learners in innovative ways to maximize target language interactions and develop their IC, this study adopts Facebook as a new computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool in a university classroom-based telecollaborative project between the U.S. and South Korea. The results revealed that Facebook offers Korean EFL learners an effective platform for intercultural interactions with people from the target culture, and Korean EFL learners demonstrate the abilities of the overall components of IC by showing many instances that fall well within Byram's (2000) assessment criteria, although some conflicting results exist. This study suggests that the adoption of Facebook is a new, innovative, and practical way to facilitate effective intercultural interactions as well as promote IC in the EFL classroom.","subject":"Social Networks, Technology Uses in Education, Intercultural Communication, Cultural Awareness, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Foreign Countries, College Students, Telecommunications, Intercultural Programs, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Participant Observation, Ethnography, Qualitative Research, Interviews, Content Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"South Korea, United States"},{"id":"EJ1075831","title":"The Intersection of Multimodality and Critical Perspective: Multimodality as Subversion","author":"Huang, Shin-ying","description":"This study explores the relevance of multimodality to critical media literacy. It is based on the understanding that communication is intrinsically multimodal and multimodal communication is inherently social and ideological. By analysing two English-language learners' multimodal ensembles, the study reports on how multimodality contributes to a critical perspective when engaging with media texts, and on the ways in which learners orchestrate multiple semiotic resources to demonstrate their analysis of the politics of representation and the resulting consequences. The findings reveal that, on the one hand, the students were able to identify the power relations between characters as well as how particular characters are marginalized in the media texts they viewed by paying attention to the multiple modes that make up the text's representation. On the other hand, the students were able to articulate the ideological subtexts they identified through the orchestration of various modes rather than relying on the linguistic mode, making their message as persuasive and effective as those in the media texts viewed.","subject":"Media Literacy, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Power Structure, Semiotics, Films, Teaching Methods, Racial Relations, Gender Differences, Interpersonal Relationship, College Students, Second Language Instruction, Critical Literacy, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Focus Groups, Interviews","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1051724","title":"Exploring EFL Teachers' CALL Knowledge and Competencies: In-Service Program Perspectives","author":"Liu, Mei-Hui, Kleinsasser, Robert C.","description":"This article describes quantitative and qualitative data providing perspectives on how six English as a Foreign Language (EFL) vocational high school teachers perceived CALL knowledge and competencies in a yearlong technology-enriched professional development program.

Drawing on a sociological approach, specialization codes of legitimation (Maton, 2007, 2014), the study found salient differences in the students' educational beliefs and practices, which appeared to be linked to their positive or negative blogging experiences. By analyzing the relations between the pedagogical design, learners' existing educational dispositions, and their blogging experiences, the study argued that the blog project assumed learners of a certain type--those who recognized themselves as &quot;knowers&quot; in terms of their blog content--while disadvantaging others who did not possess this attribute.

Focus is placed on the development of participant identities as valid writers of English texts for a perceived mass public. As part of Wikipedia writing praxis, writers are socialized to varying degrees into the community of Wikipedia. This study focuses on Hong Kong university students' reported experiences as legitimate peripheral participants, looking at the early stages of potential community membership. Ethnographic observations serve to provide a description of both the classroom and the Wikipedia site as dynamic social settings. Data sources include field notes, participant-generated written reflections, and transcripts of focus group interviews. Through these various channels it becomes clear that perception of a potentially vast reading public wields a subtle but important influence. Experiences with the Wikipedia community also play a role, motivating some participants to think deeply about their writing and prompting them to invest in writer identities online and in their local context.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Encyclopedias, Collaborative Writing, Electronic Publishing, Praxis, Computer Mediated Communication, Socialization, English (Second Language), College Students, Communities of Practice, Ethnography, Field Studies, Reflection, Focus Groups, Audience Awareness, Influences, Web 2.0 Technologies, Social Status, Discourse Analysis, Writing Processes, Transcripts (Written Records), Self Concept","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hong Kong"},{"id":"EJ1075815","title":"&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;: Multilingual Identity and Digital Translanguaging","author":"Schreiber, Brooke Ricker","description":"This paper presents a case study of the multilingual writing practices of a Serbian university student on Facebook, examining how he uses multiple varieties of English and Serbian images and video to shape his online identity and establish membership in local and global communities. Drawing on data from stimulated-recall interviews, online participant observation, and rhetorical analysis, this study shows how Aleksandar, a hip-hop artist, appropriates hip-hop codes and employs the &quot;gate-keeping&quot; function of posting links (Baek, Holton, Harp, &amp; Yaschur, 2011) by embedding links to music videos in his own highly personal code-mixed text in order to establish himself as a distinctly Serbian member of the global hip-hop community. The findings suggest that Aleksandar's language practices and attitudes might be better understood as translingual (Canagarajah, 2011), as the student integrates diverse linguistic and semiotic resources into a unified expression of identity, relying on the multimodal affordances of digital writing to accomplish his communicative goals. However, these sophisticated textual practices go undervalued in his EFL writing courses, where formal, monolingual, non-digital literacy remains primary (Saxena, 2011). These findings suggest a need to re-evaluate what it means to have a second language-mediated identity, and to expand the focus of EFL writing pedagogy.","subject":"Multilingualism, Code Switching (Language), Music, Language Usage, Language Attitudes, Video Technology, Case Studies, Participant Observation, Writing (Composition), Recall (Psychology), Semiotics, English (Second Language), Writing Instruction, Technological Literacy, Second Language Learning, Self Concept, Teaching Methods, Social Networks, Foreign Countries, Serbocroatian, College Students, Semi Structured Interviews, Qualitative Research","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Serbia"},{"id":"EJ1063743","title":"Negotiation of Meaning to Comprehend Hypertexts through Peer Questioning","author":"Yang, Yu-Fen, Hsieh, Pei-Yin","description":"Many college students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL) are less-proficient readers as they have few opportunities to negotiate their perspectives for creating meaning through peer questioning in onsite instruction.
