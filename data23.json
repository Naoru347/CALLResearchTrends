Technology can also be used in ways that circumvent the educational process and create situations where it is not being used in the appropriate way. College students that use technology to gain access to unauthorized information is a form of academic dishonesty referred to as e-cheating. This can happen both inside and outside of the classroom and takes on many forms. The Internet, in particular, fuels this behavior making it easier, faster, and more convenient then in the past. In addition, electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops are commonly used across all institutions and will continue to be used for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, faculty can use traditional pedagogical methods for educating, preventing, and reporting academic dishonesty. This paper discusses the common ways technology is being used by students for e-cheating and the actions faculty can take to hopefully reduce academic dishonesty in their courses.","subject":"Cheating, Student Behavior, Ethics, Teaching Methods, Prevention, Plagiarism, Integrity, Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Teacher Responsibility","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1137356","title":"Adding Value: Online Student Engagement","author":"Everett, Donna R.","description":"This paper seeks to add to the emerging literature related to online student engagement with additional suggestions for instructional strategies.

Re-Tooling II Education for a New Era in Healthcare","author":"Lee, Andre, Moy, Lawrence, Kruck, S. E., Rabang, Joshua","description":"Healthcare information technology is at a crossroads today. As legacy data systems converge with bleeding edge technologies, the technology environments of today's hospitals and clinics are evolving rapidly, producing new care delivery models. As a result, we need to reassess how information technology education is meeting the needs of healthcare practitioners and institutions. The recent push to adopt Health Information Technology (HIT) with financial incentives and penalties attached was a bold move, but establishing policies is easier to pen than implement. The challenge faced by many healthcare organizations is the lack of technical and organizational infrastructure, as well as skilled man power. This special issue seeks to bring new approaches to the IT classroom, particularly with HIT curriculum, training, and education. Students entering the workforce or completing professional programs will have more career options with an understanding of how to leverage enabling technologies. Those in a healthcare management and leadership capacities will also benefit from this special edition as each of the articles presented address strategic level issues and the need for IT leadership in the planning and implementation of enterprise level systems, to ensure the safety, privacy and security off all patients are protected. The authors of this special issue offer interdisciplinary perspectives on key topics shaping HIT around the world. As members of academia, curriculum is at the heart of the matter and our authors offer justification and case studies on areas where academia needs to continue its growth to serve the healthcare industry.","subject":"Health Education, Information Technology, Technological Advancement, Technological Literacy, Technology Integration, Technology Transfer, Information Science Education, Information Systems, Role of Education, Information Security, Information Networks, Educational Practices, Educational Needs, Job Skills, Higher Education","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1077591","title":"A Job Announcement Analysis of Educational Technology Professional Positions: Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities","author":"Kang, YoungJu, Ritzhaupt, Albert D.","description":"The purpose of this research was to identify the competencies of an educational technologist via a job announcement analysis.

Universities are under increased pressure to produce graduates with better security knowledge and skills, particularly emerging cybersecurity skills. Although accredited undergraduate computing programs recognize the need to solve this problem, these computing programs are constrained by accreditation standards and have limited ability to modify their curricula. This paper discusses a case study on how one Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited undergraduate IT program created a strategy to continue to teach existing security-related topics as well as emerging cybersecurity topics within its IT curriculum without increasing credit requirements. The faculty developed an &quot;IT Security-related and Cybersecurity Curriculum Taxonomy&quot; to identify strategies to move security-related topics taught in the higher level courses to lower and intermediate courses. Thus emerging cybersecurity topics could be added to high-level courses. The faculty also created the &quot;IT Student Learning (Security-related) Taxonomy&quot; by combining &quot;Bloom's Taxonomy's&quot; six levels of thinking with Webb's &quot;Depth of Knowledge Model.&quot; This student learning taxonomy enabled the faculty to review the student learning outcomes for each of the existing security-related core topics and develop new ones for the emerging cybersecurity topics.

EMR\/PM software representatives failed to live up to their original promises as deadlines passed and the employees were trained in the last days before the go live date. Training took place on a portable network brought in by the sales representatives using manufacturer's test data. After the problems started to escalate, the manufacturer's help line stopped providing assistance and CPDA was left to solve its own problems. The organization in this case faces a number of project management and technology implementation issues. These issues can be addressed in multiple courses including: enterprise architecture, project management, systems analysis and design as well as systems implementation.","subject":"Medical Services, Information Systems, Database Management Systems, Database Design, Usability, Technical Support, Technology Planning, Online Vendors, Program Implementation, Program Administration, Performance Factors, Case Method (Teaching Technique)","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1077665","title":"Berlin Kompass: Multimodal Gameful Empowerment for Foreign Language Learning","author":"Kallioniemi, Pekka, Posti, Laura-Pihkala, Hakulinen, Jaakko, Turunen, Markku, Keskinen, Tuuli, Raisamo, Roope","description":"This article presents an innovative, gameful, multimodal, and authentic learning environment for training of oral communication in a foreign language--a virtual adventure called Berlin Kompass.

Today cybersecurity is introduced at the high school level, incorporated into undergraduate computer science and information systems programs, and has resulted in a variety of cybersecurity-specific graduate programs. However, is that even enough? Is cybersecurity so broad that education needs to be more specialized? Employers want graduates who can hit the ground running: not in the broad field of cybersecurity but in some very specific areas. This paper is structured as follows. First, we will provide a brief overview of the current approaches to cybersecurity education including government standards bodies such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework, the upcoming changes in the National Information Assurance (IA) Education and Training Programs (NIETP) Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designation requirements, and the Department of Labor competency model. Second, we will present a framework for curriculum changes, which we use to determine the viability of information technology\/information systems (IS\/IT) curriculum changes to our departmental educational offerings. We examine relationships with other departments and how cybersecurity is enhanced by other domain knowledge. Then we discuss the three specialties we plan to introduce in the cybersecurity graduate curriculum: cybersecurity data analysis, cyber intelligence, and health care information security and privacy. Finally, the future cybersecurity curriculum directions are presented and discussed.","subject":"Information Security, Curriculum Design, Computer Science, Graduate Study, Information Science Education, Employers, Education Work Relationship, Standards, Guidelines, Teaching Methods, Educational Change, Excellence in Education, Models, Data Analysis, Health Services, Privacy, Records (Forms), Medical Evaluation, Program Descriptions, Private Colleges","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Virginia"},{"id":"EJ1137143","title":"The Impact of Programming Experience on Successfully Learning Systems Analysis and Design","author":"Wong, Wang-chan","description":"In this paper, the author reports the results of an empirical study on the relationship between a student's programming experience and their success in a traditional Systems Analysis and Design (SA&amp;D) class where technical skills such as dataflow analysis and entity relationship data modeling are covered.

Yet a systematic review of outcome studies regarding instructional Web 2.0 adaptations in business education has not appeared. To chart, the contemporary landscape of scholarly research in this area, the current study (a) identified, based on a keyword search in the &quot;ProQuest&quot; database, the key empirically based studies on the business education-social media nexus and (b) summarized the major findings of a subset of these studies (n?=?11) with a focus on views of business students and faculty. The main social media tools used in instruction were Facebook, blogs, Twitter, and YouTube. Although a majority of studies reported positive attitudes by students regarding academic applications of Web 2.0 technologies, faculty views were more tepid and reserved. Transgression of &quot;socializing&quot; during academic interactivity, privacy issues, and data overload were the major drawbacks noted by students. Faculty were most concerned about the vast breadth of social media modalities and the lack of training support in emerging interactive-mobile technology.

We sought to determine the effect of online homework software and in-person discussion groups on student engagement. Specifically, we posited that expectations influence this relationship, and we applied Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) to determine whether a student's expectations about discussion groups or OHS impacts Student Engagement. Moreover, with EDT, we assessed whether these impacts are direct. Our results indicate that if instructors facilitate the development of expectations when students work in groups in a class, the student's level of group satisfaction in addition to engagement in the course will be positively influenced. However, the findings indicate that OHS exerts differing effects. When instructors focus on developing realistic expectations about the OHS used in class they will achieve greater satisfaction with the technology. This satisfaction with the technology will then lead to student engagement in the course. This exploratory study, in spite of a few limitations, demonstrates the importance of managing expectations in the classroom, and its impact on current educational tools. The study also identifies additional research questions on expectation management relating to student engagement that would reduce the impact of these limitations.","subject":"Learner Engagement, Expectation, Computer Uses in Education, Computer Software, Homework, Discussion Groups, Student Satisfaction, Structural Equation Models, Student Surveys, Undergraduate Students","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1137334","title":"Enhancing the Classroom Experience: Instructor Use of Tablets","author":"Cummings, Jeff, Hill, Stephen","description":"Instructors continually search for innovative approaches to interact with and engage students in the classroom.

Steganography manipulates data to ensure the security of information, but the concept of steganography differs from cryptography. Cryptography obscures the meaning of a message, but it does not conceal the fact that there &quot;is&quot; a message. The goal of cryptography is to make data unreadable by a third party, whereas the goal of steganography is to hide the data from a third party.

Nowadays, a technology is already available that can measure the kinematic movements in 3-D by a pacemaker and implantable defibrillator giving an assessment on software. The telemetry data can be transmitted to a central system. The research aims to elaborate the methods that help to compare of the data concerning physical activity both built-in an accelerometer in Cardiac Resychrinisation Therapy (CRT) devices and data obtained from an external Actigraph GT3XE-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor. 5 persons participated in the pilot study (n = 5); mean age: 57 \u00b1 13.37; BMI: 90.6 \u00b1 7.63. The Actigraph data from CRT device were examined in a 6-day-interval, between February 28 and March 5, 2014. The investigation started conducting a 6-minute walking test and continued with the measurement of daily physical activity. For data analysis descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used. It is clear from the data obtained from Actigraph that the MET values (mean: 1.17 \u00b1 0.096) of the patients in the sample were extremely low due to their disease. However, some patients with higher physical activity than average (1.26; 1.28) seemed to be noteworthy, but they showed lower performance than healthy people. The physical activity of the patients during the 6-minute walking test corresponded to 1.9-2.48 MET. The physical activity of patients was found typically in the &quot;light or moderate range&quot; classifying the physical activity by Actigraph. Data from Actigraph are accurate and detailed making the physical activity of the patients measurable and appreciable. The results of the 6-minute walking test were in the category from moderate to very vigorous for individualized moderate physical performance based on Actigraph. It indicates the individual performance differences among patients. However, the daily physical performance is even lower than that of the 6-minute walking. We can conclude from the data related to the percentage of the average activity in CRT system to the average energy consumption and the improvement in the patients' physical condition. Due to the limitations of the sampling frequency the different time intervals cannot be isolated in the different intensity ranges. Therefore, the percentage of the data of physical activity provided by the device may have a limited use.","subject":"Physical Activities, Patients, Heart Disorders, Equipment, Physical Activity Level, Regression (Statistics), Quality of Life, Measurement, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
