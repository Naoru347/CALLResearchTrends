After a brief presentation of the pedagogical and technological backgrounds, the system is described. Central results of a series of pilots in autumn 2013 with around 100 upper secondary pupils are described and further steps are discussed. The results are highly promising, and the concept was highly appreciated by the pupils regardless of some technical problems that the prototype had during the pilots. The researcher observations and the questionnaire results show that the concept manages to create a new motivating collaborative learning context with clear added value compared with equal tasks realized in a typical classroom approach.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Questionnaires, Secondary School Students, Cooperative Learning, Teaching Methods, Oral Language, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Instructional Innovation, Educational Games, German, Foreign Countries, Feedback (Response), Multivariate Analysis, Observation","source":"Journal of Educational Technology Systems","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Finland"},{"id":"EJ1120967","title":"Do Young Learners Exploit the Same Learning Strategies as Adults?","author":"Hrozkov\u00e1, Ivana","description":"Learning strategies are considered to be one of the key factors affecting the learning process, its effectiveness and study results.

In the initial phase, we conducted a survey of students' experiences with and perceptions about blended\/online Asian language learning. We found a general lack of familiarity with, and moderate resistance toward, online language learning modes. With learner attitudes in mind, we developed online modules for beginning Korean and Japanese courses. In this article, we report the survey results and the process of developing these innovative blended and online modalities of content delivery, focusing on the strengths of the modules and the unforeseen development challenges. The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-\/copresence are explored.

While the benefits of these systems are easy to describe, students, especially those without business experience, have difficulty appreciating how these systems are used to improve the efficiency of business operations. This paper reports on a project to provide experiential learning to beginning business students. We focus on open-source enterprise and process management systems to investigate whether the benefits can be provided even by small institutions and without a large investment into commercial systems. The results of experimental studies are provided and suggest that hands-on learning on open-source systems can lead to improved learning outcomes. The main contribution is the demonstration that educators need not shy away from experiential learning when faced with the obstacles that large-scale commercial enterprise systems may present, but can instead choose a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach of easily integrating enterprise systems into the curriculum to benefit student learning.","subject":"Outcomes of Education, Experiential Learning, Management Systems, Business Administration Education, Open Source Technology, Efficiency, Small Businesses, Teaching Methods, Curriculum Design, Undergraduate Students, Foreign Countries, Statistical Analysis, Scores, Pretests Posttests, Factor Analysis","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada"},{"id":"EJ1077603","title":"Interactive Whiteboards and Digital Teaching Book to Secondary School Teachers and Contextual Affordances: Hybrid or Substitute?","author":"Pacurar, Ecaterina, Clad, Nicolas","description":"The objective of our study is to analyze the utility and the integration of the interactive whiteboard (IWB) and interactive textbook into the teaching skills.

The organizations know that voluntary work has several advantages apart from the economic benefits. It is profitable both for the society and for the individuals as well.

It comes therefore as no surprise that educational migration has become a subject of many sociological and economic studies. Their authors usually use the push-pull factors model i.e. they investigate the factors that &quot;push&quot; students out of their own countries and those that &quot;pull&quot; them to the new place of study. Our research on foreign students in Poland has been approached from a similar angle. In fact, we set out to find an answer to the question &quot;What made foreign students from Ukraine leave their country and why did they choose to study in Poland?&quot; To find our answers we conducted questionnaire interviews on a random purposive sample of foreign students from Ukraine (N = 83). In addition, to avoid the risk that the resulting correlations were accidental and the knowledge yielded in this way false, we also used the triangulation procedure--a supporting, in-depth qualitative study involving a focus group.

These questions were addressed using ethnography over 3 years. The pupils' acts differed depending on their socialization in school and in games.

The research was conducted on the convenience, stratified sample consisted of 260 secondary school pupils, attending the final class of grammar (130) and vocational (130) school. The results obtained could give an insight into the book reading culture of secondary school pupils within their leisure related to their experience of compulsory book reading at school. It results that compulsory book reading has still been an uninteresting school task for both the strata of the research sample. Moreover, it results that compulsory book reading at school has a certain influence on book reading decrease in both sample strata's leisure time. However, some guidelines how to increase the students' interest in compulsory book reading at (secondary) school as well as in book culture within their leisure time are given in this paper.","subject":"Books, Recreational Reading, Secondary School Students, Student Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Likert Scales, Reading Habits, Reading Interests, Student Surveys","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"id":"EJ1121019","title":"Materialistic Thinking and Its Mental-Hygienic Implications among Students of Budapest Business School","author":"Gomb\u00e1s, Judit","description":"Previous research with extrinsic (&quot;materialistic&quot;) and intrinsic (&quot;non-materialistic&quot;) life goals suggest that intrinsic aspirations (e.g. relationships, community service, personal development) are associated with a better functioning, mentally and physically more healthy personality. In this survey 198 undergraduate students of BBS were examined by the Aspiration Index questionnaire in order to determine the pattern of extrinsic and intrinsic life goals in their personality, to find relationship between personal background-factors and these aspirations, and to compare the attitudes of the young population to a less homogenous reference group. Compared with the reference group, young women of BBS find all goals more important, except for social commitment and general intrinsic aspiration. Both BBS female and male students were found more materialistic. The materialistic attitudes are significantly stronger among the students of business programs, but not among the students of humanities (andragogy). In conclusion, the students of BBS tend to accept more extrinsic life goals than members of the external reference group. These attitudes are influenced by the generational properties of this young population and by the educational program they attend (business or humanities). The extrinsic attitudes do not serve the individuals' personal development or happiness; neither do they serve the interests of society. The new paradigms of the future business world are not yet interiorized.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Business Schools, Mental Health, Undergraduate Students, Aspiration, Student Surveys, Personality, Background, Student Attitudes, Comparative Analysis, Gender Differences, Humanities, Questionnaires, Student Characteristics","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary (Budapest)"},{"id":"EJ1120991","title":"Everyday Physical Activity of Students in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za","author":"Fintor, J\u00e1nos G\u00e1bor","description":"The popularity of physical education lessons has already been demonstrated by a lot of essays, however, it has also been revealed that this popularity, as well as the frequency of doing sports, tends to decrease at later ages of life. Pursuing sports has a positive effect on academic performance. Introducing PE as an everyday lesson at schools was a milestone in physical education. Provided the aims are realised successfully, the general state of health of students can show a favourable change. The aim of our research, on the one hand, is to reveal how important physical education is as contrasted with other school subjects, according to those students asked. On the other hand, we aim to examine how the certain positive and negative attitudes of the subjects of our study appear in the resulting figures. The research was conducted in the form of self-completion questionnaires in four different funded institutions in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za (n = 285), in May, 2014. In the course of evaluation, we have used multivariate function analysis as well as frequency research and cross table reference. Participants mainly regard PE as important as other school subjects, however, boys significantly regard it more important than girls do. Those who do sports on a regular basis were more likely to agree that PE lessons are conducted in a friendly atmosphere than those who do sports less. Significantly, boys tended to agree with positive statements about sport.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Physical Activities, Physical Activity Level, Physical Education, Student Attitudes, Relevance (Education), Questionnaires, Multivariate Analysis, Gender Differences, Elementary School Students, Preferences, Exercise Physiology, Factor Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"id":"EJ1120993","title":"Possibilities in Anaemia Prevention during Pregnancy through the Basic Health Care System","author":"Kar\u00e1csony, Ilona, Albrecht, Hanna, Brantm\u00fcller, \u00c9va","description":"In case of pregnancies, one of the most common pathological conditions in internal medicine is aneamia with iron-deficiency.

It was also observable in the case of those living at higher living standards that they take fetus-protecting vitamins with a significantly higher frequency before the pregnancy than those living at lower living standards. According to our research data, 67% of the sample developed aneamia. In our research the risk group consisted of young, vegetarian expectant mothers with low education and the multiparas. After conception, the timing of gynaecological consultation was appropriate and the majority of the sample had a clear idea of the ways of preventing aneamia. However, prevention was only realized in practice--based on the criteria--only with a frequency of 12%. It would be important to consciously plan pregnancy. After taking expectant mothers into care, they should--as soon as possible--be screened for the deficiency and in need, supplements should be started. Risk groups should be given greater attention. In their case, a routine supplement of iron would be desirable even before the development of a deficiency. During pregnancy care, awareness must be raised and an iron-rich diet should be established at the beginning. Beyond these, general practitioner, health visitors have the opportunity--through the close relationship with the expectant mothers--to control laboratory tests, provide appropriate information, recommend vitamin preparations as well as check taken medications.","subject":"Pregnancy, Prenatal Influences, Prenatal Care, Prevention, Mothers, Case Records, Socioeconomic Status, Dietetics, Eating Habits, Disease Incidence, Foreign Countries","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"id":"EJ1121032","title":"The Examination of the Factors Determining Career Engagement for Students Preparing for a Social Job","author":"Juh\u00e1sz-Kl\u00e9r, Andrea, Varga, Erika","description":"The higher education courses for social experts started more than 25 years ago in Hungary.

Due to the huge amount of experience accumulated in both education and practice since then, in our empirical research an answer was sought to the question which personal and professional competencies determine the long-term engagement to a career and how the competency experience of the students correlates with their further career aspirations. In the research nearly 500 responses from students from 8 different Hungarian higher education institutions were analysed by applying questionnaires and tests accepted in international practice together with our own measures. Data were collected about the students' career decision self-efficiency experiences, their personality traits and also about the question how they see their future profession. Based on our results the students who had a definite idea of their future professional career even during their studies and were determined with improved professional and personal competencies during the training made up a distinct group and were more dedicated to their career.

This part was realized through complex of exercises which were supposed to have influence on transformation of motor abilities in relation to the structure with standard duration of certain parts of a lesson. It is determined that certain increase in body movement of students during physical activity can significantly contribute to better development of motor abilities. These abilities determine correct physical development and strengthening of health, which determines general aim of physical education.","subject":"Psychomotor Skills, Physical Activities, Preschool Children, Physical Activity Level, Physical Education, Foreign Countries, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Statistical Analysis, Elementary School Students","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Serbia"},{"id":"EJ1121049","title":"The Effect of a Complex (3-Week) Therapy on the Hip and Knee Joints in Obese Patients","author":"T\u00f3v\u00e1ri, Anett, Hermann, M\u00e1ria, T\u00f3v\u00e1ri, Ferenc, Priszt\u00f3ka, Gy\u00f6ngyv\u00e9r, Kr\u00e1nicz, J\u00e1nos","description":"Currently, overweight and obesity are the most widespread problems in life-style having a significant impact on everyday life, and thus, conduct of life.

Overweight definitely has an effect on motion: some people are not involved in certain activities as it is impossible for them because of their weight problem. Thus, even more health problems are generated because of the overweight. The first question arising in discussing the actuality of this issue is what effect the applied therapy (massage, therapeutic exercises, electrotherapy and balneotherapy) has on the knee and hip joints of patients with weight problems hospitalised in our Institute for a 3-week complex therapy. Based on my prior hypothesis, positive changes are detected in a minimum percentage in the condition of overweight or obese patients. My hypothesis was that the range of flexion and extension of the hip and knee joints would improve compared to other movements. Based on the results of the studied population (n = 30), my hypothesis seems to be proven. After the 3-week complex therapy of obese patients, positive changes were found in the prearranged assessments and tests, thereby improving the general health, life-style, life quality and mental status of the patients. After the end of the complex therapy, patients were provided life-style counselling and exercise schemes to be performed in their home to maintain the achieved health status.","subject":"Obesity, Human Body, Pain, Life Style, Therapy, Program Effectiveness, Intervention, Hypothesis Testing, Rehabilitation, Foreign Countries, Counseling, Exercise, Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"id":"EJ1120992","title":"Hungarian Dimensions of Physical Activity Based on Studies at School Ages","author":"Cselik, Bence, Szmodis, M\u00e1rta, Szots, G\u00e1bor, \u00c1cs, Pongr\u00e1c","description":"It is an old pursuit to find the balance between nature and society (within the individual and the sum of people).

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search. In qualitative researches, newspapers are considered to be public archive and used as reference documents. The data obtained was grouped depending on the newspapers which it was taken from, on the year of publication, on where they took place, on the gender of the victims and on who the sufferers are.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Bullying, Newspapers, Higher Education, Qualitative Research, News Reporting, Violence","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"id":"EJ1121034","title":"A Comparative Study of Breakfast Habits of Romanian and Spanish Adolescents Enrolled in Southern Spain Schools","author":"Soriano-Ayala, Encarnaci\u00f3n, Cala, Ver\u00f3nica C.","description":"Introduction: Globalization has favored intra-European Commission (EC) and extra-EC migration to Spain. One of the most numerous cultural groups that have settled in the southern Spain is from Romania. Coexistence, especially in schools, has made us become interested in knowing the eating habits at breakfast of Romanian and Spanish populations. Numerous studies show that the food intake at breakfast, mostly made before leaving home, has an incidence on the physic wellbeing of adolescent throughout the day. The processes of acculturation are also inseparable from the eating habits, health and life, that maintain the migrant teenagers. Breakfast is analyzed as one of the habits more associated with diet quality; paradoxically, one of the findings of our study, many adolescents do not take a proper breakfast every day. Objectives: The study analyzes the characteristics and the main cultural and gender differences in the implementation of breakfast: its maintenance or omission in young autochthonous and immigrants of Romanian origin in the southeast Spanish schools. Design. This is a cross-sectional study with a cluster sampling in two Primary schools and seven Secondary schools. The instrument applied was an adaptation of the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. Sample. It has been formed by 1472 students between 11 and 18 years old; nationality: 1315 were Spanish and 157 were Romanians. Data analysis. Descriptive and differential analyses using the chi-square and U of Mann-Whitney statistics. Results: In the study we identified 1.2% of Spaniards and 3.3% of Romanians who either skip breakfast or do not eat foods throughout the morning. The main breakfast foods of the Spanish students are dairy, bread and cereals, cookies, juice and olive oil; for the Romanian students the basic foods at breakfast are cereals, dairy products, juices, biscuits and jams. We have found significant differences between the two compared cultural groups. We also found significant differences between the food eaten by men of the two cultural groups (Spanish and Romanian) and by the food eaten by women (Spanish and Romanian) in the breakfast food. Conclusions: The results show the need to further promote and implement educational programs that encourage students to make breakfast before leaving home. Also, it is necessary, they take care of the intake of the right foods to start the day and contemplate this habit from a transcultural and gender approach. Significant differences were identified in the breakfast practice food by both genders and cultural groups.","subject":"Adolescents, Foreign Countries, Comparative Analysis, Eating Habits, Food, Immigrants, Statistical Analysis, Adolescent Attitudes","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Spain, Romania"}]
