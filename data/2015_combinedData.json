Games are said, amongst others, to be motivating, to lower affective barriers in learning, and to encourage foreign or second language (L2) interaction. But how do learners actually experience the use of games? What impact does gameplay have on students' perceptions of themselves as learners, and how does this affect their learning practice? These questions are important as they are likely to influence the success of digital gamebased language learning, and as a result the way teachers might integrate games into the curriculum. In this study we investigated the experiences of five students who had participated in a fifteen-week game-based learning program at a university in Thailand. We conducted six interviews with each of them (for a total of 30 interviews) to identify what impact gameplay had in particular on their willingness to communicate in English (MacIntyre, D\u00f6rnyei, Cl\u00e9ment &amp; Noels, 1998).

However, there appears to be a gap between what the designer intends and what the user wants. This paper investigates Chinese university EFL teachers' perceptions of online English language websites and resources. The study focuses on a number of components of major language areas and skills in ELL websites, website materials, language users' preferences, and website usability. A total of 1519 English academics from 139 universities across China completed the online survey, and 164 of them voluntarily participated in focus group interviews anonymously. The empirical evidence of this study has highlighted that a pedagogically-oriented ELL website, targeting audiences with a variety of language proficiencies, was much liked by the Chinese EFL teachers. A preference was observed to see more current authentic language, examination-oriented English learning materials and tasks, and Eastern/non-Anglophone topics in the websites. In addition, it is found that website usability is another key factor that would impact ELL website popularity. A well-designed ELL website can effectively assist Chinese EFL learners to enhance their language competence and achieve optimal learning outcomes.

Recent research, for example, involving second language (L2) teacher candidates has demonstrated that aspiring teachers who completed online methodology instruction were less confident in their abilities to teach L2 learners than their counterparts who completed the same instruction in a face-to-face (F2F) setting. To address the limitations of online instruction, while still incorporating its associated strengths, the development and implementation of hybridized methodology coursework have been proposed. Following this recommendation, the researchers developed and implemented hybridized L2 methodology courses that mirrored their pre-existing online and F2F equivalents. Using a mixed methodology, the researchers then conducted a three-way comparison of instructional delivery modes (online, F2F, hybrid) to investigate their impact on L2 teacher candidate self-efficacy. Although the results demonstrated that all three modes of instruction can be equally effective at increasing candidate confidence, they also highlighted the potential of hybridized instruction to address the limitations of online and F2F instruction, while still including their strengths. The findings also emphasized that simply viewing or participating in live demonstrations of teaching strategies in post-secondary methodology courses is not sufficient.

In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress.

To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness. The system's functions overcame the limitations of observing students' metacognitive processes described in previous studies, and enabled teachers to provide follow-up instruction.

However, they often require a significant amount of additional effort beyond that required of assigning conventional homework problems. When the projects take place in an online course setting, the level of complexity subsequently increases. Valuing the overall contribution of such projects, in light of their additional instructor and course costs, can be difficult. Such valuations are further complicated with the measures being subjective. In 1992, Drs. Robert Kaplan and David Norton published an article in Harvard Business Review detailing a model for measuring the effect of multiple perspectives, both financial and subjective, on business performance (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992). The Balanced Scorecard approach provides both an internal (process based) and external (outcomes based) standpoint to evaluating an organization utilizing four perspectives: (1) Learning and Growth, (2) Business Process, (3) Customer and (4) Financial (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1996). With its thorough approach to evaluating objective and subjective measures of business performance, the model serves as a potential framework for use in the educational setting.

The Northwind Traders sample database is available by Microsoft for download and use in Microsoft Access, and illustrates transactional processing for a fictitious company that imports (purchases) and exports (sells) specialty foods from around the world. The database contains sample tables, queries, forms, reports, Macros, VBA Class Objects, functions and modules, and other database features. Although the primary purpose for the database is to serve as an illustrative design template for students and practitioners, unfortunately the database and business processes are largely undocumented. This paper attempts to more completely document the business processes, including establishing business rules, describing relationships and participations, and discusses some problems with the existing design. Following understanding of the database and associated business processes, this paper can be used as both a teaching tool and a guide for practitioners using the Northwind Traders sample database as a design template.

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search. In qualitative researches, newspapers are considered to be public archive and used as reference documents.

All the turns produced by the teacher and the students were counted, the teacher language output in the recordings was classified into 19 discourse function categories, and then all the discourse functions were classified into six teacher roles. The results show that the during-task phase was student output oriented. This study reveals that in the pre-task phase the teacher used the largest number of types and tokens of discourse functions, and played a significant technical and social role. In the during-task phase, the teacher focused on motivating students to participate, monitoring student activities, and providing task support. In the post-task phase, the teacher was a language guide.

One of the byproducts of this new environment is the growth in opportunity for language learning, in particular through informal environments such as social networks and networked gaming.

In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities.

One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data. The findings revealed valuable insights through the eyes of the learners regarding what technology the learners found to be helpful and/or obstructive, both in the course as well as for their personal use, and suggestions for improvements in use of technology are given.

The use of qualitative methods in conjunction with other approaches as in mixed method research designs are a particular focus. It is argued that qualitative methods are especially effective when used in this way. The discussion also aims to elaborate upon the role of qualitative approaches within CALL specifically, as a domain for research study with particular attributes that require a qualitative orientation. Here the use of electronic dictionaries is considered. Dictionary use is suited to such a discussion because it occurs frequently in everyday life, suggesting a qualitative approach, as well as in research studies that are strictly controlled, as in a quantitative approach.

ESL teachers intending to analyse English language subject textbooks written for secondary school students with the aim of gaining information about what bilingual secondary school students need to know in terms of language to process academic textbooks cannot avoiding deal with a dilemma. It needs to be decided which way it is most appropriate to analyse the texts in question. Handbooks of English applied linguistics are not immensely helpful with regard to this problem as they tend not to give recommendation as to which major text analytical approaches are advisable to follow in a pre-college setting. The present theoretical research aims to address this lacuna. Respectively, the purpose of this pedagogically motivated theoretical paper is to investigate two major approaches of ESP text analysis, the register and the genre analysis, in order to find the more suitable one for exploring the language use of secondary school subject texts from the point of view of an English as a second language teacher. Comparing and contrasting the merits and limitations of the two contrastive approaches allows for a better understanding of the nature of the two different perspectives of text analysis. The study examines the goals, the scope of analysis, and the achievements of the register perspective and those of the genre approach alike. The paper also investigates and reviews in detail the starkly different methods of ESP text analysis applied by the two perspectives. Discovering text analysis from a theoretical and methodological angle supports a practical aspect of English teaching, namely making an informed choice when setting out to analyse texts in English. It can be concluded from the literature that the register perspective yields more readily applicable data of text analysis for ESL teachers instructing in a pre-college environment.

A secondary analysis approach using a longitudinal large-scale dataset, the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), was used to assess the frequency of computer-mediated communication as a predictor of English literacy skills in a sample of 510 deaf youths in the United States. Regression analyses demonstrated that deaf adolescents who e-mailed or chatted more frequently exhibited higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These results suggest that communication technologies should be further explored as a potential avenue that may support deaf individuals' English language and literacy development.", "subject": "Deafness, Communication Skills, Literacy, Reading Skills, Longitudinal Studies, Regression (Statistics), English, Computer Mediated Communication, Electronic Mail, Reading Comprehension, Language Acquisition, Surveys, Scores, Hearing Impairments, Statistical Analysis, Correlation, Individual Characteristics, Adolescents", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1077835", "title": "Technology Use and Self-Perceptions of English Language Skills among Urban Adolescents", "author": "Li, Jia, Snow, Catherine, Jiang, Jingjing, Edwards, Nicholas", "description": "Technology including social media and other technology applications enabled by different technology devices offer many possibilities for second language learners to improve their learning, if they are interested in doing so.

Data were collected through a survey of 531 students in an urban public middle school in the USA. The results showed that students used technology for diverse purposes regardless of their first language background. Although overall technology students' access was comparable to national averages, the use of technology for many specific purposes was markedly lower, lending support to the notion of a new digital divide between students from high- and low-income families based on technology knowledge and meaningful application of such knowledge rather than mere access. Student reports of their own English skills were related to various specific uses of technology, e.g., blogging and email. These relationships were stronger for ELLs, particularly those in grade 6, than for NESs. The results suggest that younger ELL adolescents may be more aware of their language constraints and prone to use technology in certain ways than their NES peers.

By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy.

The paper concludes that fourteen sessions, designed as an overview of the whole range of corpus-based resources and applications, is not sufficient to encourage teacher trainees to use corpora in their future work if they have no contact with these resources and tools in other classes.

The paper then examines the effect the use of the social networking tool had on group cohesion and learner-to-learner interaction, and how these, in turn, enhanced informal language learning due to an increase in learner collaboration. The study found that the use of Ning enhanced group cohesion and that learners started working in different groups once Ning was introduced.

Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use.

Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality.

The central aim of this article is to gain a deeper understanding of how to create successful learning environments with technology-based tools. A model of scaffolded e-learning, based on current thinking and constructivist learning theory, was adopted for teaching social informatics in a university context. The focus was on evidence-based pedagogies including: (1) authentic learning by applying &quot;Pedagogy 2.0&quot; tasks and social media (2) the adoption of scaffolded pedagogy by the instructor to achieve learning outcomes. The methodology used was qualitative, based on teacher pedagogical tasks and activities designed for students in order to establish the success of the types of scaffolding offered and student perceptions of their effectiveness in promoting collaboration and learning. The research demonstrates that technological innovations which are accompanied by pedagogical scaffolding promote effective teaching of social informatics. The research concludes that while web 2.0 tools can enable engaged, self-regulated learning, students may not always be familiar with the tools or cognitive strategies to support their learning processes.

Based on the premise of Task-Technology Fit Theory, this study suggests that the effectiveness of student learning in online courses depends on the alignment between two. Furthermore, it conceptualizes the formation of such a fit through the lens of Media Synchronicity Theory: each type of learning task in the online environment requires a certain level of media synchronicity, and various e-learning tools enable different levels of media synchronicity. Their alignment forms along two dimensions of media synchronicity: the purpose dimension ranging from conveyance to convergence and the process dimension ranging from asynchronous to synchronous. The conceptualization leads to research hypotheses that posit the aligned relationships between learning tasks and e-learning tools in terms of purpose and process. The hypotheses were tested with the observations collected from an experiment, and the conjoint analysis results support that students do perceive and prefer the fit between learning tasks and e-learning tools along the two dimensions.

As evident from the literature review, most of these implementations are happening in the western countries such as USA, UK, while the level of implementation of CC in developing countries such as India is rare. Moreover, implementing CC technology in the educational sector require various decisions to be made by the managers of the Information Technology (IT) department such as selecting suitable deployment model, vendor providing cloud service, etc. in their respective university or institute. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to address one such decision. Since, different types of CC deployment are available; selecting a suitable one plays a key role, as it might have an impact on the requirements of various stakeholders such as students, teachers, administrative staff (especially the staff members in the IT department), etc. apart from affecting the overall performance of the facilities such as a laboratory. Naturally, a proper decision by analysing multiple perspectives has to be made while carrying out such strategic initiatives by any educational institute. Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology has been chosen as the research methodology to discuss and demonstrate the above decision problem that was faced in real time by one of the educational institutes in India, offering high-quality management education. The IT managers of this institute were planning to switch over to CC technology for the computer laboratory and they have to make a decision of choosing suitable alternative CC deployment models such as private cloud (PRC), public cloud (PUC), community cloud (COC), hybrid cloud (HYC), etc. by analysing and comparing them based on various factors and perspectives such as elasticity, availability, scalability, etc. Since, multiple factors are involved in making such a strategic decision, the most commonly used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model--namely, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a decision support during the decision making process. Findings: The team of decision makers, who were planning to implement CC in the case institute, found that PRC is best as they believed that it would provide adequate cost savings, apart from providing necessary security to maintain confidential information such as student's detail, grades, etc. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained are based on a single case study. Hence, they cannot be generalized for institutions across educational sector. However, the decision making situation and understanding its impact on the stakeholders of the educational institute can be common across various educational institute. Practical implications: Using a real-life case study of an educational institute, this paper presented a strategic decision making situation, which needs to be considered by the IT managers of the educational institutes when they decide to switch over to CC technology. Various criteria to be considered during the decision making process was identified from the literature review were identified and enumerated. These factors would useful for the IT managers of the different educational institute and they can suitably add or delete these decision criteria as per their requirements and situation at hand. Moreover, the algorithm of AHP, which was used as a decision support, was presented in a step-by-step manner, which should be beneficial for the practitioners to apply the same for similar decision making situations. Originality/value: It is believed that this paper would be the first to report on a strategic decision of choosing the deployment model for CC technology especially in the educational sector. Similarly, this paper would also contribute to the field of CC, as it lists out the decision criteria that are to be considered for making the above decision, which has not got adequate importance.

Effectiveness was evaluated at the end of the semester (N = 72). Results support the efficacy of screencasts over traditional lectures for step-by-step instruction. To maximize effectiveness, students should follow along with the screencasts during class time. Moreover, professors should consider interspersing screencasts with collaborative group work. Also, professors should ensure that the screencasts have an adequate level of difficulty for the students.

In the spirit of &quot;the first among equals,&quot; we posit that design should have preeminence in the education of information systems professionals. Design frames problem understanding and defines what system's quality means. It behooves our profession to prepare designers who deliver systems that not only &quot;work,&quot; but also deliver systems that society will recognize as &quot;working well.&quot; The research community recognizes this as reflected in a renewed interest in design science research and in information systems design theory. While our discipline has been recently reshaped by offshoring, outsourcing, and service-oriented architectures, which provide myriad options for managing information in organizations, design persists as a central aspect of the discipline. This is so as information systems design remains close to stakeholders because design materializes an organization's core business model and strategy. This paper contemplates a design-focused IS curriculum and postulates a perspective on design that values the subjective sensibilities of stakeholders as well as an objective, algorithmic depiction of computing. The latter has shaped the classic education of a developer as a master of technology while the former nurtures an aesthetic awareness that captures nuances of stakeholder satisfaction and a more inclusive conception of system quality. The skillset of designers is a superset of that of developer and as such, a designer must be craftsman and more, a reflective practitioner skilled in the art of generative metaphor.", "subject": "Information Systems, Information Science Education, Curriculum Development, Job Skills, Skill Development, Computer System Design, Systems Approach, Mastery Learning, Reflection, Figurative Language, Teaching Methods, Apprenticeships, Handicrafts", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1125956", "title": "Toward a Framework for Evaluating Online Instruction in Higher Education", "author": "Warford, Mark K.", "description": "SUNY-wide, the online horse has left the gate.

Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction. While some may argue that the ICW cannot take the place of face-to-face interactions in a well-designed and executed ESL course, the e-learning environment offers several advantages: it is self-paced, private (thus less threatening), and provides continuous opportunities for practice and reinforcement.", "subject": "Online Courses, Web Based Instruction, Foreign Nationals, Nurses, Communicative Competence (Languages), Intercultural Communication, Workshops, Phonemes, Vowels, Intonation, Electronic Learning, Improvement Programs, Independent Study", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1042721", "title": "Environmental Factors Affecting Computer Assisted Language Learning Success: A Complex Dynamic Systems Conceptual Model", "author": "Marek, Michael W., Wu, Wen-Chi Vivian", "description": "This conceptual, interdisciplinary inquiry explores Complex Dynamic Systems as the concept relates to the internal and external environmental factors affecting computer assisted language learning (CALL).

However, most respective papers limit their investigation period with the early or mid-2000s. In the authors' opinion, some of the global trends which revealed themselves particularly clearly in the second half of the 2000s call for a revision of the convergence issue. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Several methodologies for measuring the global convergence/divergence trends exist in the economic literature. This paper seeks to contribute to the existing literature on unconditional \u00df-convergence of the per capita incomes at the global level. Findings: In the recent years, the gap between high-income and middle-income countries is decreasing especially rapidly. The gap between high-income and low-income countries, meanwhile, is decreasing at a much slower pace. At the same time, the gap between middle-income and low-income countries is actually widening. Indeed, in the early 1980s GDP per capita in the low-income countries was on average three times lower than in the middle-income countries, and this gap was totally overshadowed by the more than ten-time abyss between the middle-income and the high-income countries. Now, however, the GDP per capita in low-income countries lags behind the middle-income ones by more than five times, which is largely the same as the gap (rapidly contracting in the recent years) between the high-income and the middle-income countries. This clearly suggests that the configuration of the world system has experienced a very significant transformation in the recent 30 years. Research limitations/implications: The research concentrates upon the dynamics of the gap in per capita income between the high-income, the middle-income, and the low-income countries.

Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013}, {"id": "EJ1004375", "title": "A Study of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication in Second Life--The ARCHI21 Experience", "author": "Wigham, Ciara R., Chanier, Thierry", "description": "Three-dimensional synthetic worlds introduce possibilities for nonverbal communication in computer-mediated language learning.

To address how non-native English speaking (NNE) game players participate in language learning through game play and beyond-game culture, three generations of activity theories and a multiple-case study design were employed in this study. The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture.

Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games.

The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy.

The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies.

Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada.

Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.

Today, numerous websites provide a wealth of information about the sun and the planets, combining text, photos, and graphics, and even interactive models. Some sites also include lesson plans and suggested classroom activities. Yet none of these resources allow for development of a lesson plan interactively, or offer tracking of student performance. Many lesson plans also have materials or space requirements that are impractical for some schools.

This challenge prompted the research project focused on improving faculty's ability to support their pedagogy with technology. A systematic Learning Management System (LMS) Process Improvement Model, named OASA, is proposed which enables educational institutions to establish a systematic and effective faculty development program for BL teaching and learning. OASA is structured into five levels, and transformation from lower to higher levels of capability in BL teaching and learning is based on prescribed processes, and is intended to provide a new foundation of practices. The conceptualization of OASA was demonstrated by means of a prototype with scope focusing on enhancing faculty's level of capability from Level Two to Level Three. The research has been validated using several validation methods. The main finding is that OASA is a well-founded approach that can help educational institutions overcome challenges relating to faculty's lack of knowledge in using technology in teaching. This study found that adopting OASA would make faculty development processes more understandable, give faculty a starting point for BL pedagogy, keep faculty focused on tasks, and show a process of BL improvement until faculty achieve best practices.

Stony Brook University has adopted an approach to using ePortfolios within the curriculum that emphasizes reflection. Stony Brook University successfully piloted ePortfolios in the Fall 2010 Semester and discovered their use facilitated the inquiry process for the students. Integrative ePortfolios have been used successfully over the past 3 years in colleges and programs such as Writing and Rhetoric, Engineering, Business, Leadership and Service, and Technology Systems Management. Within these programs, the process of inquiry takes center stage as educators embrace learner-centered course delivery and curriculum design in which the student is an active participant in the instruction. The learner-centered educator partners with the students, encouraging them to continue their quest for discovery while building knowledge connections to the next levels of learning. This inquiry process is the foundation for high impact learning practices such as 1st-year experiences, learning communities, capstone projects, internships, and service learning that research has shown to increase student engagement and retention. The main outcome for learner-centered instruction is to engage students in the inquiry process and integrate their learning in all areas of their lives. The inquiry process and integrative learning need to become a habit of thought and connection that ignites learning and the construction of knowledge throughout a lifetime.

From these considerations, it is reasoned that the complex paradigm offers a foundation to conceive a unique design concept. The complex educational design is then described in its constructs and features. To conclude, reflections and implications of this original, conceptual model are taken into account. Findings: An online language course design--although aiming at schematizing a series of learning situations and defining target teaching contents--needs to contemplate unpredictability and instability which prevent it from having a pre-established fixed design.

The main focus of this study is to examine the role of technology savvy in terms of the experiences, skills and self-efficacy of students in using information technologies. It is hypothesized that technology savvy directly affects major e-textbook experiences, including perceived e-textbook helpfulness, student involvement and learning outcome, as well as moderates the relationships among them. Based on the data gathered through a survey, the results suggest that the e-textbook experiences of students vary significantly across technology veterans and novices, suggesting a salient direct effect of technology savvy on e-textbook experiences. Also, the mediating relationship between e-textbook helpfulness and learning outcome through student involvement is stronger for technology veterans than novices, suggesting a salient moderating effect of technology savvy on the relationships among e-textbook experiences. An additional comparison based on gender is performed to find out whether the gender stereotyping regarding technology usage holds true for the new generation of students in the use of e-textbooks. The results show that gender does not fully account for the differences in e-textbook experiences, and its moderating effect on their relationships is not as strong as that of technology savvy. To enhance the adoption of e-textbooks, therefore, it is important for publishers and instructors to customize training and support for students at different levels of technology savvy.", "subject": "Student Characteristics, Electronic Publishing, Textbooks, Gender Differences, Technological Literacy, College Students, Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Student Surveys, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis, Experience, Factor Analysis", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1125921", "title": "Tools of Engagement Project: On-Demand Discovery Learning Professional Development", "author": "Sullivan, Roberta, Burns, Beth, Gradel, Kathleen, Shi, Shufang, Tysick, Cynthia, van Putten, Cherie", "description": "Increasingly, the traditional professional development (PD) model at 4-year institutions fails to meet the evolving needs of faculty.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines existing open academic courses initiatives and presents a conceptual model for describing an academic course. Next, the elements of the conceptual model are mapped to the CDM specification, as well as to the CDM-ECTS application profile for describing (open) academic courses with ECTS compatible information. Finally, the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool is presented, which allows authoring of (open) academic courses descriptions based on the proposed conceptual model and by following the CDM-ECTS application profile. Findings: Based on the evaluation results, it is evident that ASK-CDM-ECTS can clearly support the process of describing academic courses offered by European Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with ECTS compatible information following the CDM-ECTS application profile; and the process of searching and retrieving academic courses offered by European HEIs. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation scenarios were executed with users' representatives from only one HEI. Future work intends to conduct further experiments involving users' representatives from different HEIs for evaluating the proposed tool. Social implications: OpenCourseWare has become a social movement aiming to equal opportunities in education. This paper presents the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool, which can be exploited for setting-up European Open Courses Initiatives that will facilitate open access to education and learning for the societies of the EU Member States. Originality/value: Despite the development of the CDM specification for describing (open) academic courses, and of its application profile CDM-ECTS, it appears that there exists no software tool that allows authoring and publishing on the web descriptions of (open) academic courses following CDM-ECTS.

The paper aims to introduce ONTODAPS, the Ontology-Driven Disability-Aware Personalised E-Learning System, which has the mechanism for such personalisation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews current e-learning systems that provide personalisation for students, including their strengths and weaknesses. The paper presents personalisation and its techniques and then presents ONTODAPS, which personalises learning resources and services to students. In total, three case studies are considered to show how personalisation is achieved using ONTODAPS. Findings: This paper shows that it is possible to use automated ontology-based agents intercommunicating to provide an effective personalisation for disabled students. The results reveal that ONTODAPS is flexible enough to provide enough control and freedom to drive their learning. The results also suggest that ONTODAPS has the ability to provide appropriate levels of learner control by allowing them to self-direct learning through personalising learning resources and then allowing them to choose which resources they wish to access. This thus gives them a sense of ownership and control. Research limitations/implications: This research reveals that it is possible for e-learning systems to personalise learning for users with multiple disabilities. Thus, by considering the needs of such users and consulting them in the design and development process, developers of e-learning systems can produce systems that are both accessible and usable by students with disabilities. Practical implications: The inclusion of multiple formats of learning resources and personalisation of their presentation to students means students will have increased access to such resources, with the potential of consuming and assimilating the information. This also has the potential of improving understanding and hence and improvement in results. Social implications: This research shows that ONTODAPS is a medium where disabled students can have equivalent learning experience with their non-disabled peers. This could potentially increase access to learning for disabled students and possibly help improve their results due to an increase in accessibility of learning resources and usability of the system. This system thus complies with contemporary legislation which requires \"reasonable adjustments\" or \"reasonable accommodations\" to be made to meet the needs of disabled people. Originality/value: Although personalisation has been applied in e-commerce systems, making them very successful, such personalisation is still a wish for e-learning systems which struggle to catch up. This research proposes a solution in the e-learning domain and its novelty is in its application to disabled students, including those with multiple disabilities.

Instructors use different approaches to teaching this course: some lecturing and assigning programming exercises, others only assigning programming exercises without lectures. This research compares the effects of these two teaching approaches on learning performance by collecting data from two sections of an introductory programming course in an urban public university. One section used lectures and assignments while the other used assignments only. Data analysis included tests within each dataset, tests across the two datasets, and tests of a simple model over the combined dataset. Results indicated that both approaches are effective, but the exercises-only approach is more effective than lectures combined with exercises. Further analysis indicated that students' current programming skills, prior programming experience, and grade expectations are significant antecedents of learning performance in the course. Results support the conclusion suggesting that when teaching introductory programming courses, instructors may want to consider choosing the student-centered active learning over the traditional lecture format in order to improve students' learning performance.

This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams.

The Tao were confronted with modernization beginning with the Japanese colonial time and later through missionary work and Sinicization. These exogenous factors had a major influence on the Tao's traditional lifestyle and cultural habits. After democratization and due to the Tao's empowerment and efforts of multicultural education as well as interactive learning applications, a revitalization of traditional knowledge, and cultural customs became visible.

The data collection are based on ethnographic field work that provides a unique and authentic picture of the subject. Besides participating and systematic and informal observation, qualitative forms of interviews were applied. Findings: The paper highlights the influences and dynamics of exogenous and endogenous factors on the traditional lifestyle of an indigenous community in the western Pacific.

Cyberbullying in this post-secondary institutional study was defined in this research as repeated use of technology to threaten or harass. Researchers utilized an online survey and interview methodology to gather cyberbullying data and information. The survey sought information from a randomly selected group of students (n = 16,983) enrolled at any of the university's campuses, inclusive of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education students, where 276 students participated. Through the survey invitation, a voluntary interview was also requested where nine students were interviewed. Results included confirmation that cyberbullying incidents did occur to and by college students as well as instructors at this institution. The majority of both survey and interview participants did not think it a problem at the university level, but this issue is more serious and prevalent in secondary schooling.

The models are designed to guide practitioners in prioritizing management resources in companies. Information security management education should address the gap between the academic ideals and practice. This paper introduces a teaching method that has been in use as coursework for ten years. In addition to the theoretical lectures on information security management issues, the students of the course perform information security assessments of local small and medium enterprises (SME). The general assessment of the information security status of a company gives the students a view into what the companies have taken into practice and if they have used theoretical models to guide their work. The analysis of the status and suggestions for improvements also teach the students to scale the theory with the size and operations of the company. This is important because usually information security management literature takes the viewpoint of large organizations, whereas the companies that participate in the assessment are small or medium-sized. Course feedback from the students shows that the assignment is perceived to be useful and interesting, and that it works well when paired with the theoretical teaching of the course. The students find working with real companies motivating, and state that they have learned more than they would have learned on a purely theoretical course.

Every society needs to create ideas for further development and in order to become recognised as developed. The purpose of this paper is to show how different cultures at different times created similar ideas and theories to develop their society. Design/methodology/approach: A comparison between the development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun and Wallerstein's famous &quot;world system theory&quot; is undertaken to show that similar ideas of development were in existence even centuries before. Technically, seminar papers were posted and reviewed on an e-learning platform in order to reach such peer-reviewed assessment in a &quot;Global Studies&quot; curriculum. Findings: The paper shows that the similarity between all developed countries is a strong state and extensive economic activity in different areas among cooperative people. All of these three characteristics are measurable and visible in today's western societies, and also centuries before in other countries (the Golden Age of the Muslim World). Research limitations/implications: Limits to comparing the two development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun with Wallerstein's world system theory arise because of the large gap in time and the big cultural differences between the authors of the two theories. There is, on one side, Ibn-i-Khaldun in the thirteenth century whose religion (Islam) played an important role in his development theory and on the other side there is a western author, Immanuel Wallerstein in the twentieth century. In Wallerstein's development theory, religion has almost no role. Another point is that Wallerstein's theory provides a guideline to almost all countries for reaching development but Ibn-i-Khaldun's target countries are the Muslim countries which were experiencing decline at his time.

This was supplemented with interview and personal observations. Demographic data, pattern of internet use, impact of internet on academic activities and problems faced when using internet were assessed. Data analysis was by simple descriptive statistics. Findings: The use of internet use was widespread (100 per cent) among the scientists with the majority (43.6 per cent) using it every day, and mean internet use experience being 6.3 years. The majority of respondents (64.5 per cent) accessed the internet from a commercial cybercafe followed by homes (49.1 per cent).

This study uses multiple complexity, accuracy and fluency measures to analyze transcripts of paired peer microteaching tasks at the beginning and end of a ten-week program. Analysis of the results shows that in general the teachers' language performances improved, but that there were complex interactions among the measures.

They are also difficult for second language writers to acquire, with many language learners misusing them semantically and stylistically. This study attempts to determine if DDL can assist students with this task. It investigates the correct semantic usage and proportion of academic linking adverbials in student writing both before and following treatment. Results indicate that DDL techniques do in fact help students acquire and better employ linking adverbials in their writing.

DPSFM utilizes performance-based actions with facilitation methods to help participants design action plans. Interactive Management (IM) utilizes a holistic, culturally sensitive and systemic approach to resolve complex problems. Communication technological assistance is accompanied by IM to enhance parsimony and support saliency of the ideas generated. Both approaches support action plans. This paper argues that both DPSFM and IM are theoretical frameworks that are valuable for conflict resolution, educators, and social science specialists who are interested in conducting research under the paradigm of knowing referred to as \"Scholarship of Engagement\". This paradigm engages participants in research while promoting action plans and improving status quo conditions. The current paper overviews the benefits of both models and makes a strong case for application of their communication technologies across a variety of contexts. DPSFM and IM are directly involved with promoting change, and supporting actions to improve human conditions. The framework of \"Scholarship of Engagement\" is introduced as an integrative model for \"praxis\". The purpose of this paper was to provide alternative options for working in facilitation groups.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses in depth the current status of grid electricity in Africa continent and suggested solar electricity as an alternative cost-effective method to the existing grid electricity problem in remote areas. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, health, communication, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on how solar power generation can be developed. Findings: The paper shows that in developed countries where ICT has been applied extensively, ICT offers increased opportunities for sustainable economic development and plays a critical role in rapid economic growth, productive capacity improvements, education, government, agriculture and international competitiveness enhancement. The paper has pointed out that ICT has yet to make significant impact in most African countries due to lack of reliable and adequate electricity. Solar electricity has been seen as the most cost-effective way of generating electricity, especially in remote rural areas, for ICT devices. For the widespread of solar power generation in Africa, various strategies have been identified which include training of qualified solar engineers and technicians, establishing PV markets and business modes, introduction of solar energy education in schools and universities, political leaders appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for rural communities, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs. Practical implications: The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established PV markets and business modes (especially in remote areas), lack of solar energy education in schools have to be addressed before the benefits of ICT in Africa can be seen. Other issues include African countries appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. Overhaul of existing systems needs to take place in order to provide the means to deal with some of these issues. Originality/value: Availability of reliable electrical energy remains crucial for development of ICT in rural African countries. Solar electricity is clearly one of the most promising prospects to the grid electricity problem in African countries because most African countries lie in the sunshine belt.

Using a multiple case study approach, this paper reports on stakeholders&apos; experiences and comparisons of two different types of blended Spanish courses, one that harnesses ample technology and another that uses it much less. Using ethnographic data triangulation and systemic functional discourse analysis, four conflicting themes were constructed with respect to two types of BL courses and online versus face-to-face (f2f) classes. The first type of dilemma pertained to (a) the time commitments and (b) relationships developed in each course. The second type of dilemma surrounded the capacity of online and f2f classes for fostering (c) speaking skills development and (d) student understanding. Implications of these four conflicts of opinion for BL course developers, teachers, and researchers are discussed.", "subject": "Teaching Experience, Student Experience, Blended Learning, Technology Uses in Education, Technology Integration, Spanish, Ethnography, Discourse Analysis, Intermode Differences, Second Language Learning, Time Perspective, Interpersonal Relationship, Speech Skills, Academic Achievement, Barriers, Performance Factors, Conflict", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1027978", "title": "Fostering Student Interaction and Engagement in a Virtual Learning Environment: An Investigation into Activity Design and Implementation", "author": "Hampel, Regine, Pleines, Christine", "description": "Online tools, such as forums, wikis, and blogs lend themselves to learners negotiating meaning and co-constructing knowledge through interaction. However, not enough is known about how tasks need to be designed to make best use of the possibilities of complex virtual learning environments (VLEs) to motivate and support learners, foster interaction, and contribute to knowledge construction. This article reports on a two-year study exploring the design and implementation cycle of online activities as an integral part of a distance language course. When the course was introduced in 2009, activities had been designed on the basis of second language acquisition principles as well as sociocultural theories, providing a basis for student interaction and taking into account the affordances of the environment, a Moodle-based VLE. After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners. Consequently, activities were re-designed and a number of changes were implemented in 2010 that included more teacher involvement, fewer tasks, a simpler structure, and a reduced number of tools. A comparison of learner participation across the two years shows that these changes had a positive impact on learner engagement.", "subject": "Learner Engagement, Interaction, Teaching Methods, Technology Uses in Education, Online Courses, Distance Education, Second Language Instruction, Virtual Classrooms, Student Surveys, Interviews, Diaries, Statistical Analysis, Student Attitudes, Educational Technology", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1013969", "title": "Student Training in the Use of an Online Synchronous Conferencing Tool", "author": "Heiser, Sarah, Stickler, Ursula, Furnborough, Concha", "description": "With the increase of online language teaching the training needs of teachers have long been established and researched.

The research focuses on three iterations of the learner training conducted over a 21-month period, drawing on almost 500 completed student feedback responses. The findings show that students considered the training sessions helpful in establishing how online language classes operate and gaining confidence to participate actively. Specifically they benefited from using their L1 to practice techniques for projecting their social presence in an online communicative situation, compensating for the lack of features such as body language, non-verbal communication, and spatial impressions. As for their teachers, the research demonstrated a need to reflect on the terminology used to explain CMC tools.

Findings: The AT is able to first test the hypotheses on global development and globalisation and second to suggest new hypotheses on the mechanisms of globalisation. Results can be used in curricula of Global Studies worldwide. Research limitations/implications: These data analysis has still to be complemented by sociological, political and economic theories providing insights into global restructuration processes and structural transitions through globalisation. Practical implications: &quot;Forward-looking&quot; as an emerging scientific discipline is supported by the proposed detailed analytical methods, namely by providing quantitative, in-depth techno-socio-economic megatrends.

It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications: The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field.

In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved.

Defining the internationalisation of education as an ever more significant part of globalisation, the paper insists that the education should be recognised as the foundation for sustainable development and building of the global knowledge society. Design/methodology/approach: The author presents a vision of the education as of a global &quot;soft power&quot; thus introducing a new understanding and a different application of the notion used mainly in a negative sense which, in author's opinion, can serve as educational instrument and technology of attraction. The author's methodology and approach take note of the basic principles of the globalisation theory and include the recognition of the fact that the contradiction between global interdependent problems of the planetary scale on one side and the existing rather fragmentary and desultory way of acquiring knowledge on the other side is the main challenge to the present and future quality of the human potential. Findings: Considering ways how to continue the work on ESD after the end of the UN DESD in 2014, the author expresses a point of view that it should be an innovation project requiring state, public, law and financial support.

Students can benefit from the study of information systems security when security concepts are introduced in the context of real-world industry standards. The development of a data security standard for organizations operating within the credit card payment industry serves as an excellent example of a real-world security standard that lends itself to classroom study. The establishment and requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the associated consequences for noncompliance, represents a businesslike approach to the organizational protection of data that students will find interesting and one to which they will relate. Everybody uses credit cards! Incorporating the topic of PCI DSS into an activity allows students to learn and apply PCI DSS concepts to a business setting. Just asking &quot;If everyone uses credit cards, why don&apos;t all businesses accept them?&quot; will start a process of exploration for the class. A hypothetical business teaching case, &quot;Blue Mountain Jams&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;), illustrates the challenge of PCI DSS mandates for small businesses. Small business is given some leeway in self-assessment under PCI DSS to document compliance after the decision is made to accept credit card payments. That leeway gives students the opportunity to learn and analyze the PCI DSS requirements and compliance methods and to determine the best course of action for a business that has made the decision to start accepting credit cards.", "subject": "Credit (Finance), Information Security, Retailing, Compliance (Legal), Business Administration Education", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1031212", "title": "Reading and Grammar Learning through Mobile Phones", "author": "Wang, Shudong, Smith, Simon", "description": "This paper describes an ongoing language-learning project, three years into its development.

Its goal is to help researchers in finding related works. Further, this paper seeks to explore the effect of using relational features in addition to textual features on the quality of recommended citations. Design/methodology/approach: In order to propose a novel citation recommendation system, first a new relational similarity measure is proposed for calculating the relatedness of two publications. Then, a recommendation algorithm is presented that uses both relational and textual features to compute the semantic distances of publications of a bibliographic dataset from the input text. Findings: The evaluation of the proposed system shows that combining relational features with textual features leads to better recommendations, in comparison with relying only on the textual features. It also demonstrates that citation context plays an important role among textual features. In addition, it is concluded that different relational features have different contributions to the proposed similarity measure. Originality/value: A new citation recommendation system is proposed which uses a novel semantic distance measure. This measure is based on textual similarities and a new relational similarity concept. The other contribution of this paper is that it sheds more light on the importance of citation context in citation recommendation, by providing more evidences through analysis of the results.

However, they do not usually consider external collaborations as a strategic issue despite their benefits. The purpose of this paper consists of identifying different patterns of collaboration and internationalization of universities, with the aim of helping managers and policy makers to take decisions related to their national research policies. Design/methodology/approach: Co-authorship analysis has been used in conjunction with social network analysis to model inter-institutional collaborations as networks, extracting these collaborations from the Web of Science database. Using several structural properties of the extracted networks and applying a statistical treatment, the main profiles of collaborations and internationalization have been obtained. Findings: Obtained results distinguish three patterns of collaborations according to the intensity and scope of collaborations. The statistical treatment also provides a segmentation of universities according to their collaboration profiles. Finally, universities are represented in bi-dimensional maps using external collaborations as a measure of similarity. Research limitations/implications: Although this study is restricted to English universities, it could probably be extended at least to other countries in the European Union or even other developed countries.

The survey asked these students to share their perceptions of jobs that do not require information systems skills, of skills employers look for in new employees, of reasons that peers major in information systems disciplines, and of reasons they do not. This research suggests further exploration of reasons students and professionals chose information systems as a field of study and work. It also suggests using a survey group other than general business majors.", "subject": "College Freshmen, Majors (Students), Information Systems, Career Choice, Incidence, Student Surveys, Likert Scales, Business Administration Education, Knowledge Level, Job Skills, Statistical Analysis, Student Interests, Employment Potential, Salaries", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1121648", "title": "Integration Policies in Europe--A Web-Based Search for Consensus", "author": "\u00d6ttl, Ulrich Franz Josef, Pichler, Bernhard, Schultze-Naumburg, Jonas, Wadispointner, Sabine", "description": "Purpose: The purpose of the present paper is to describe a web-based consensus-finding procedure, resulting in an agreement among the group of participants representing global stakeholders regarding the interdisciplinary topic in a university master's seminar on &quot;Global Studies&quot;.

The data obtained from the corresponding questionnaire were analyzed using ordered logit analysis and four different models were independently estimated with respect to social network services. Findings: Ordered logit estimation results revealed that frequency of log in to social network sites, time spent on social network sites, and following event alerts were three predictors that had significant impact on the frequency of all four social network sites' use. Particularly; event participation, information sharing, following on top ranked topics, and purchasing a product through social media were the other additional predictors of college students' willingness to use the corresponding social network sites.

After theoretical deliberation, it uses a planned world-wide information system as a case study for applying the notion of granularity regarding economic sectors, time steps, geographic regions and correlations for energy, water, land use and several other drivers of global change. Design/methodology/approach: A planet-wide information system might optimally include areas such as human development indicators, water demand and supply and deforestation issues. A short literature analysis on &quot;granularity&quot; shows this concept to have a highly culturally determined and constructivist nature. Findings: The spatial, temporal and sectoral granularity of data presentation strongly impacts conclusions and considerations while looking forward. Hence, granularity issues are of key importance for the question of which megatrends are ultimately discerned as most relevant. Practical implications: These findings may impact the regular report on global megatrends authored by the European Environment Agency, as well as world-wide energy and emission scenarios and technological foresight, such as the &quot;Global Change Data Base&quot; as a next step of research. Social implications: In future research, the step from purely quantitative perceptions towards structural perceptions, pattern recognition and understanding of system transitions might be facilitated.

Employers want graduates who can hit the ground running: not in the broad field of cybersecurity but in some very specific areas. This paper is structured as follows. First, we will provide a brief overview of the current approaches to cybersecurity education including government standards bodies such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework, the upcoming changes in the National Information Assurance (IA) Education and Training Programs (NIETP) Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designation requirements, and the Department of Labor competency model. Second, we will present a framework for curriculum changes, which we use to determine the viability of information technology/information systems (IS/IT) curriculum changes to our departmental educational offerings.

We sought to determine the effect of online homework software and in-person discussion groups on student engagement. Specifically, we posited that expectations influence this relationship, and we applied Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) to determine whether a student's expectations about discussion groups or OHS impacts Student Engagement. Moreover, with EDT, we assessed whether these impacts are direct. Our results indicate that if instructors facilitate the development of expectations when students work in groups in a class, the student's level of group satisfaction in addition to engagement in the course will be positively influenced. However, the findings indicate that OHS exerts differing effects. When instructors focus on developing realistic expectations about the OHS used in class they will achieve greater satisfaction with the technology.

Thus, organizations are increasingly seeking managers with knowledge of value chain related to mobile-oriented business activities, usually referred to as mobile commerce (m-commerce). Accordingly, business management schools are interesting in designing their curricula to respond to the need for m-commerce knowledge and, in particular, the scope of the content for an m-commerce course. The general conception of m-commerce is that it is a component of e-business or e-commerce. This paper presents the unique dimensions of m-commerce that makes it stand out as a separate course for postgraduate business management students. This paper also provides input in regard to the design and delivery of the course by drawing upon the recent teaching experience of the authors at a highly respected business school in India. The course design covers mobility-related technology elements as related to business in diverse industry segments and is expected to enable students to develop a suitable mobile strategy for a real-time business scenario. The course content was drawn primarily from research papers, industry reports, and examples of trending mobile applications. The pedagogy was a blend of lectures and classroom exercises on innovative case studies. The response of the students to the course indicated a high degree of satisfaction in regard to its relevance.

Nowadays, a technology is already available that can measure the kinematic movements in 3-D by a pacemaker and implantable defibrillator giving an assessment on software.

The research aims to elaborate the methods that help to compare of the data concerning physical activity both built-in an accelerometer in Cardiac Resychrinisation Therapy (CRT) devices and data obtained from an external Actigraph GT3XE-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor. 5 persons participated in the pilot study (n = 5); mean age: 57 \u00b1 13.37; BMI: 90.6 \u00b1 7.63. The Actigraph data from CRT device were examined in a 6-day-interval, between February 28 and March 5, 2014. The investigation started conducting a 6-minute walking test and continued with the measurement of daily physical activity. For data analysis descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used. It is clear from the data obtained from Actigraph that the MET values (mean: 1.17 \u00b1 0.096) of the patients in the sample were extremely low due to their disease. However, some patients with higher physical activity than average (1.26; 1.28) seemed to be noteworthy, but they showed lower performance than healthy people. The physical activity of the patients during the 6-minute walking test corresponded to 1.9-2.48 MET. The physical activity of patients was found typically in the &quot;light or moderate range&quot; classifying the physical activity by Actigraph. Data from Actigraph are accurate and detailed making the physical activity of the patients measurable and appreciable. The results of the 6-minute walking test were in the category from moderate to very vigorous for individualized moderate physical performance based on Actigraph. It indicates the individual performance differences among patients. However, the daily physical performance is even lower than that of the 6-minute walking. We can conclude from the data related to the percentage of the average activity in CRT system to the average energy consumption and the improvement in the patients' physical condition. Due to the limitations of the sampling frequency the different time intervals cannot be isolated in the different intensity ranges.

For most universities, general education is the groundwork for the student's university experience. These courses span multiple disciplines and allow students to experience a wide range of topics on their path to graduation. Programming classes, e.g., Introduction to Programming, have not typically been an option as part of a general education course sequence at most universities. This study found that, only half of universities offer any kind of programming course in the General Education (GenEd) Program. The data also show that only two-thirds of institutions offer a computing class of any kind as a general education option. Institutions with ABET accredited Information Systems (IS) programs are significantly lower in both of these categories. This paper demonstrates the reasoning and process for including a programming class as an option in a GenEd Program, thereby showing how a programming class can be used to satisfy the requirements of a general education course. This results in two significant advantages to the computing department and university since the departments expand their reach to many more students, with a potential of increasing the number of majors or minors within the department; and non-computing majors have the opportunity to take courses that have not traditionally been offered in the GenEd Program.

Thus, even more health problems are generated because of the overweight.

One of the most numerous cultural groups that have settled in the southern Spain is from Romania. Coexistence, especially in schools, has made us become interested in knowing the eating habits at breakfast of Romanian and Spanish populations. Numerous studies show that the food intake at breakfast, mostly made before leaving home, has an incidence on the physic wellbeing of adolescent throughout the day. The processes of acculturation are also inseparable from the eating habits, health and life, that maintain the migrant teenagers. Breakfast is analyzed as one of the habits more associated with diet quality; paradoxically, one of the findings of our study, many adolescents do not take a proper breakfast every day. Objectives: The study analyzes the characteristics and the main cultural and gender differences in the implementation of breakfast: its maintenance or omission in young autochthonous and immigrants of Romanian origin in the southeast Spanish schools. Design. This is a cross-sectional study with a cluster sampling in two Primary schools and seven Secondary schools. The instrument applied was an adaptation of the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. Sample.

Descriptive and differential analyses using the chi-square and U of Mann-Whitney statistics. Results: In the study we identified 1.2% of Spaniards and 3.3% of Romanians who either skip breakfast or do not eat foods throughout the morning. The main breakfast foods of the Spanish students are dairy, bread and cereals, cookies, juice and olive oil; for the Romanian students the basic foods at breakfast are cereals, dairy products, juices, biscuits and jams. We have found significant differences between the two compared cultural groups. We also found significant differences between the food eaten by men of the two cultural groups (Spanish and Romanian) and by the food eaten by women (Spanish and Romanian) in the breakfast food. Conclusions: The results show the need to further promote and implement educational programs that encourage students to make breakfast before leaving home. Also, it is necessary, they take care of the intake of the right foods to start the day and contemplate this habit from a transcultural and gender approach.
