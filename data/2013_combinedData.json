[{"id": "EJ1004381", "title": "Testing Learner Reliance on Caption Supports in Second Language Listening Comprehension Multimedia Environments", "author": "Leveridge, Aubrey Neil, Yang, Jie Chi", "description": "Listening comprehension in a second language (L2) is a complex and particularly challenging task for learners. Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013}, {"id": "EJ1004375", "title": "A Study of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication in Second Life--The ARCHI21 Experience", "author": "Wigham, Ciara R., Chanier, Thierry", "description": "Three-dimensional synthetic worlds introduce possibilities for nonverbal communication in computer-mediated language learning.

While research into the impact of these activities for language development has yielded some data regarding vocabulary gains and improvements in fluency and comprehension skills, the mechanisms at work in such language development have proved difficult to study because of the private nature of most online informal learning. In this study, an emic approach is adopted, involving a group of students experienced in second language acquisition research, who used blogs to report on their own online informal learning of English over a three-month period. Extensive examples from these blogs are used to build up a picture of the learning processes at work, within a framework suggested by the literature of complex dynamic systems. These results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the way in which these processes are used by informal learners in different phases of real communicative tasks.", "subject": "Informal Education, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Electronic Learning, Systems Approach, Web Sites, Electronic Publishing, Students", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013}, {"id": "EJ1004378", "title": "Multimodal Language Learner Interactions via Desktop Videoconferencing within a Framework of Social Presence: Gaze", "author": "Satar, H.

Although these emerging activities are an essential part of gaming culture, they have not attracted much attention from researchers and only a few empirical studies have been done on learning through beyond-game culture. Language learning in particular has not been extensively researched despite the proliferation of game players who speak English as a foreign language within this community. To address how non-native English speaking (NNE) game players participate in language learning through game play and beyond-game culture, three generations of activity theories and a multiple-case study design were employed in this study. The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture. First, words or phrases used in game play could be learned while playing games. Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games. Third, these two types of engagement in gaming culture were closely related to influencing language learning through repeated practices and collaborative interactions. In conclusion, language learning through gaming is appropriately understood when ecological perspectives are adopted to look at both sides of gaming culture.", "subject": "Discourse Analysis, Video Games, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Internet, Sentences, Researchers, Computer Mediated Communication, Case Studies, Intercultural Communication, Electronic Mail, Interviews", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1004379", "title": "Enhancement of Automatization through Vocabulary Learning Using CALL: Can Prompt Language Processing Lead to Better Comprehension in L2 Reading?", "author": "Sato, Takeshi, Matsunuma, Mitsuyasu, Suzuki, Akio", "description": "Our study aims to optimize a multimedia application for vocabulary learning for English as a Foreign Language (EFL).

This implies that the automatization of word decoding to free the working memory is indispensable.

According to our research, multimedia application users not only retained more words and recalled their meanings more quickly but also obtained higher scores on reading comprehension tests that contained the words learned through the application.

The recent proliferation of online reading materials has made information easily available to L2 readers; however, L2 readers' ability to deal with them requires the development of specific reading strategies. The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy. The program offers four types of reading strategy functions (Global, Problem-solving, Support, and Socio-affective) through 15 strategy buttons: Keyword, Preview, Prediction, Outline, Summary, Semantic Mapping, Pronunciation, Speed Reading, Dictionary, Translation, Grammar, Highlight, Notebook, Music Box, and My Questions. Forty college teachers and thirty-two EFL students in Taiwan were invited to use and evaluate this program. The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies.

Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011.

A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html]. Hence, students use the basis of their worldviews to shape and interpret their own meanings in writing. Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.

Today, numerous websites provide a wealth of information about the sun and the planets, combining text, photos, and graphics, and even interactive models. Some sites also include lesson plans and suggested classroom activities. Yet none of these resources allow for development of a lesson plan interactively, or offer tracking of student performance. Many lesson plans also have materials or space requirements that are impractical for some schools. SpaceSafari is an interactive multimedia software program for learning about the solar system that integrates information, exploration, and instruction. It employs a real-time 3D space for navigation, a module for learning about the planets, and an administrative interface for creating activities and tracking student progress. The design of the software resembles a first-person adventure game: a treasure hunt through the solar system in which the missions are created by the teacher. SpaceSafari was developed for both the formal (classroom) and informal (home) learning spaces, with a choice of input modes and display options.

However, adopting a BL approach poses some challenges to faculty; the most important obstacle found in this research is faculty's lack of knowledge regarding the use of technology in their teaching. This challenge prompted the research project focused on improving faculty's ability to support their pedagogy with technology. A systematic Learning Management System (LMS) Process Improvement Model, named OASA, is proposed which enables educational institutions to establish a systematic and effective faculty development program for BL teaching and learning. OASA is structured into five levels, and transformation from lower to higher levels of capability in BL teaching and learning is based on prescribed processes, and is intended to provide a new foundation of practices. The conceptualization of OASA was demonstrated by means of a prototype with scope focusing on enhancing faculty's level of capability from Level Two to Level Three. The research has been validated using several validation methods. The main finding is that OASA is a well-founded approach that can help educational institutions overcome challenges relating to faculty's lack of knowledge in using technology in teaching. This study found that adopting OASA would make faculty development processes more understandable, give faculty a starting point for BL pedagogy, keep faculty focused on tasks, and show a process of BL improvement until faculty achieve best practices.

Stony Brook University has adopted an approach to using ePortfolios within the curriculum that emphasizes reflection. Stony Brook University successfully piloted ePortfolios in the Fall 2010 Semester and discovered their use facilitated the inquiry process for the students. Integrative ePortfolios have been used successfully over the past 3 years in colleges and programs such as Writing and Rhetoric, Engineering, Business, Leadership and Service, and Technology Systems Management. Within these programs, the process of inquiry takes center stage as educators embrace learner-centered course delivery and curriculum design in which the student is an active participant in the instruction. The learner-centered educator partners with the students, encouraging them to continue their quest for discovery while building knowledge connections to the next levels of learning. This inquiry process is the foundation for high impact learning practices such as 1st-year experiences, learning communities, capstone projects, internships, and service learning that research has shown to increase student engagement and retention. The main outcome for learner-centered instruction is to engage students in the inquiry process and integrate their learning in all areas of their lives. The inquiry process and integrative learning need to become a habit of thought and connection that ignites learning and the construction of knowledge throughout a lifetime.

From these considerations, it is reasoned that the complex paradigm offers a foundation to conceive a unique design concept. The complex educational design is then described in its constructs and features. To conclude, reflections and implications of this original, conceptual model are taken into account. Findings: An online language course design--although aiming at schematizing a series of learning situations and defining target teaching contents--needs to contemplate unpredictability and instability which prevent it from having a pre-established fixed design.

The main focus of this study is to examine the role of technology savvy in terms of the experiences, skills and self-efficacy of students in using information technologies. It is hypothesized that technology savvy directly affects major e-textbook experiences, including perceived e-textbook helpfulness, student involvement and learning outcome, as well as moderates the relationships among them. Based on the data gathered through a survey, the results suggest that the e-textbook experiences of students vary significantly across technology veterans and novices, suggesting a salient direct effect of technology savvy on e-textbook experiences. Also, the mediating relationship between e-textbook helpfulness and learning outcome through student involvement is stronger for technology veterans than novices, suggesting a salient moderating effect of technology savvy on the relationships among e-textbook experiences. An additional comparison based on gender is performed to find out whether the gender stereotyping regarding technology usage holds true for the new generation of students in the use of e-textbooks. The results show that gender does not fully account for the differences in e-textbook experiences, and its moderating effect on their relationships is not as strong as that of technology savvy. To enhance the adoption of e-textbooks, therefore, it is important for publishers and instructors to customize training and support for students at different levels of technology savvy.", "subject": "Student Characteristics, Electronic Publishing, Textbooks, Gender Differences, Technological Literacy, College Students, Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Student Surveys, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis, Experience, Factor Analysis", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1125921", "title": "Tools of Engagement Project: On-Demand Discovery Learning Professional Development", "author": "Sullivan, Roberta, Burns, Beth, Gradel, Kathleen, Shi, Shufang, Tysick, Cynthia, van Putten, Cherie", "description": "Increasingly, the traditional professional development (PD) model at 4-year institutions fails to meet the evolving needs of faculty.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines existing open academic courses initiatives and presents a conceptual model for describing an academic course. Next, the elements of the conceptual model are mapped to the CDM specification, as well as to the CDM-ECTS application profile for describing (open) academic courses with ECTS compatible information. Finally, the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool is presented, which allows authoring of (open) academic courses descriptions based on the proposed conceptual model and by following the CDM-ECTS application profile. Findings: Based on the evaluation results, it is evident that ASK-CDM-ECTS can clearly support the process of describing academic courses offered by European Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with ECTS compatible information following the CDM-ECTS application profile; and the process of searching and retrieving academic courses offered by European HEIs. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation scenarios were executed with users' representatives from only one HEI. Future work intends to conduct further experiments involving users' representatives from different HEIs for evaluating the proposed tool. Social implications: OpenCourseWare has become a social movement aiming to equal opportunities in education. This paper presents the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool, which can be exploited for setting-up European Open Courses Initiatives that will facilitate open access to education and learning for the societies of the EU Member States. Originality/value: Despite the development of the CDM specification for describing (open) academic courses, and of its application profile CDM-ECTS, it appears that there exists no software tool that allows authoring and publishing on the web descriptions of (open) academic courses following CDM-ECTS.

The paper aims to introduce ONTODAPS, the Ontology-Driven Disability-Aware Personalised E-Learning System, which has the mechanism for such personalisation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews current e-learning systems that provide personalisation for students, including their strengths and weaknesses. The paper presents personalisation and its techniques and then presents ONTODAPS, which personalises learning resources and services to students. In total, three case studies are considered to show how personalisation is achieved using ONTODAPS. Findings: This paper shows that it is possible to use automated ontology-based agents intercommunicating to provide an effective personalisation for disabled students. The results reveal that ONTODAPS is flexible enough to provide enough control and freedom to drive their learning. The results also suggest that ONTODAPS has the ability to provide appropriate levels of learner control by allowing them to self-direct learning through personalising learning resources and then allowing them to choose which resources they wish to access. This thus gives them a sense of ownership and control. Research limitations/implications: This research reveals that it is possible for e-learning systems to personalise learning for users with multiple disabilities. Thus, by considering the needs of such users and consulting them in the design and development process, developers of e-learning systems can produce systems that are both accessible and usable by students with disabilities. Practical implications: The inclusion of multiple formats of learning resources and personalisation of their presentation to students means students will have increased access to such resources, with the potential of consuming and assimilating the information. This also has the potential of improving understanding and hence and improvement in results. Social implications: This research shows that ONTODAPS is a medium where disabled students can have equivalent learning experience with their non-disabled peers. This could potentially increase access to learning for disabled students and possibly help improve their results due to an increase in accessibility of learning resources and usability of the system. This system thus complies with contemporary legislation which requires \"reasonable adjustments\" or \"reasonable accommodations\" to be made to meet the needs of disabled people. Originality/value: Although personalisation has been applied in e-commerce systems, making them very successful, such personalisation is still a wish for e-learning systems which struggle to catch up. This research proposes a solution in the e-learning domain and its novelty is in its application to disabled students, including those with multiple disabilities.

Instructors use different approaches to teaching this course: some lecturing and assigning programming exercises, others only assigning programming exercises without lectures. This research compares the effects of these two teaching approaches on learning performance by collecting data from two sections of an introductory programming course in an urban public university. One section used lectures and assignments while the other used assignments only. Data analysis included tests within each dataset, tests across the two datasets, and tests of a simple model over the combined dataset. Results indicated that both approaches are effective, but the exercises-only approach is more effective than lectures combined with exercises. Further analysis indicated that students' current programming skills, prior programming experience, and grade expectations are significant antecedents of learning performance in the course. Results support the conclusion suggesting that when teaching introductory programming courses, instructors may want to consider choosing the student-centered active learning over the traditional lecture format in order to improve students' learning performance.

This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams.

The Tao were confronted with modernization beginning with the Japanese colonial time and later through missionary work and Sinicization. These exogenous factors had a major influence on the Tao's traditional lifestyle and cultural habits. After democratization and due to the Tao's empowerment and efforts of multicultural education as well as interactive learning applications, a revitalization of traditional knowledge, and cultural customs became visible.

The data collection are based on ethnographic field work that provides a unique and authentic picture of the subject. Besides participating and systematic and informal observation, qualitative forms of interviews were applied. Findings: The paper highlights the influences and dynamics of exogenous and endogenous factors on the traditional lifestyle of an indigenous community in the western Pacific.

Cyberbullying in this post-secondary institutional study was defined in this research as repeated use of technology to threaten or harass. Researchers utilized an online survey and interview methodology to gather cyberbullying data and information. The survey sought information from a randomly selected group of students (n = 16,983) enrolled at any of the university's campuses, inclusive of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education students, where 276 students participated. Through the survey invitation, a voluntary interview was also requested where nine students were interviewed. Results included confirmation that cyberbullying incidents did occur to and by college students as well as instructors at this institution. The majority of both survey and interview participants did not think it a problem at the university level, but this issue is more serious and prevalent in secondary schooling.

The models are designed to guide practitioners in prioritizing management resources in companies. Information security management education should address the gap between the academic ideals and practice. This paper introduces a teaching method that has been in use as coursework for ten years. In addition to the theoretical lectures on information security management issues, the students of the course perform information security assessments of local small and medium enterprises (SME). The general assessment of the information security status of a company gives the students a view into what the companies have taken into practice and if they have used theoretical models to guide their work. The analysis of the status and suggestions for improvements also teach the students to scale the theory with the size and operations of the company. This is important because usually information security management literature takes the viewpoint of large organizations, whereas the companies that participate in the assessment are small or medium-sized. Course feedback from the students shows that the assignment is perceived to be useful and interesting, and that it works well when paired with the theoretical teaching of the course. The students find working with real companies motivating, and state that they have learned more than they would have learned on a purely theoretical course.

Every society needs to create ideas for further development and in order to become recognised as developed. The purpose of this paper is to show how different cultures at different times created similar ideas and theories to develop their society. Design/methodology/approach: A comparison between the development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun and Wallerstein's famous &quot;world system theory&quot; is undertaken to show that similar ideas of development were in existence even centuries before. Technically, seminar papers were posted and reviewed on an e-learning platform in order to reach such peer-reviewed assessment in a &quot;Global Studies&quot; curriculum. Findings: The paper shows that the similarity between all developed countries is a strong state and extensive economic activity in different areas among cooperative people. All of these three characteristics are measurable and visible in today's western societies, and also centuries before in other countries (the Golden Age of the Muslim World). Research limitations/implications: Limits to comparing the two development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun with Wallerstein's world system theory arise because of the large gap in time and the big cultural differences between the authors of the two theories. There is, on one side, Ibn-i-Khaldun in the thirteenth century whose religion (Islam) played an important role in his development theory and on the other side there is a western author, Immanuel Wallerstein in the twentieth century. In Wallerstein's development theory, religion has almost no role. Another point is that Wallerstein's theory provides a guideline to almost all countries for reaching development but Ibn-i-Khaldun's target countries are the Muslim countries which were experiencing decline at his time.

This was supplemented with interview and personal observations. Demographic data, pattern of internet use, impact of internet on academic activities and problems faced when using internet were assessed. Data analysis was by simple descriptive statistics. Findings: The use of internet use was widespread (100 per cent) among the scientists with the majority (43.6 per cent) using it every day, and mean internet use experience being 6.3 years. The majority of respondents (64.5 per cent) accessed the internet from a commercial cybercafe followed by homes (49.1 per cent).

This study uses multiple complexity, accuracy and fluency measures to analyze transcripts of paired peer microteaching tasks at the beginning and end of a ten-week program. Analysis of the results shows that in general the teachers' language performances improved, but that there were complex interactions among the measures.

They are also difficult for second language writers to acquire, with many language learners misusing them semantically and stylistically. This study attempts to determine if DDL can assist students with this task. It investigates the correct semantic usage and proportion of academic linking adverbials in student writing both before and following treatment. Results indicate that DDL techniques do in fact help students acquire and better employ linking adverbials in their writing.

DPSFM utilizes performance-based actions with facilitation methods to help participants design action plans. Interactive Management (IM) utilizes a holistic, culturally sensitive and systemic approach to resolve complex problems. Communication technological assistance is accompanied by IM to enhance parsimony and support saliency of the ideas generated. Both approaches support action plans. This paper argues that both DPSFM and IM are theoretical frameworks that are valuable for conflict resolution, educators, and social science specialists who are interested in conducting research under the paradigm of knowing referred to as \"Scholarship of Engagement\". This paradigm engages participants in research while promoting action plans and improving status quo conditions. The current paper overviews the benefits of both models and makes a strong case for application of their communication technologies across a variety of contexts. DPSFM and IM are directly involved with promoting change, and supporting actions to improve human conditions. The framework of \"Scholarship of Engagement\" is introduced as an integrative model for \"praxis\". The purpose of this paper was to provide alternative options for working in facilitation groups.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses in depth the current status of grid electricity in Africa continent and suggested solar electricity as an alternative cost-effective method to the existing grid electricity problem in remote areas. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, health, communication, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on how solar power generation can be developed. Findings: The paper shows that in developed countries where ICT has been applied extensively, ICT offers increased opportunities for sustainable economic development and plays a critical role in rapid economic growth, productive capacity improvements, education, government, agriculture and international competitiveness enhancement. The paper has pointed out that ICT has yet to make significant impact in most African countries due to lack of reliable and adequate electricity. Solar electricity has been seen as the most cost-effective way of generating electricity, especially in remote rural areas, for ICT devices. For the widespread of solar power generation in Africa, various strategies have been identified which include training of qualified solar engineers and technicians, establishing PV markets and business modes, introduction of solar energy education in schools and universities, political leaders appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for rural communities, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs. Practical implications: The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established PV markets and business modes (especially in remote areas), lack of solar energy education in schools have to be addressed before the benefits of ICT in Africa can be seen. Other issues include African countries appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. Overhaul of existing systems needs to take place in order to provide the means to deal with some of these issues. Originality/value: Availability of reliable electrical energy remains crucial for development of ICT in rural African countries. Solar electricity is clearly one of the most promising prospects to the grid electricity problem in African countries because most African countries lie in the sunshine belt.

Using a multiple case study approach, this paper reports on stakeholders&apos; experiences and comparisons of two different types of blended Spanish courses, one that harnesses ample technology and another that uses it much less. Using ethnographic data triangulation and systemic functional discourse analysis, four conflicting themes were constructed with respect to two types of BL courses and online versus face-to-face (f2f) classes. The first type of dilemma pertained to (a) the time commitments and (b) relationships developed in each course. The second type of dilemma surrounded the capacity of online and f2f classes for fostering (c) speaking skills development and (d) student understanding. Implications of these four conflicts of opinion for BL course developers, teachers, and researchers are discussed.", "subject": "Teaching Experience, Student Experience, Blended Learning, Technology Uses in Education, Technology Integration, Spanish, Ethnography, Discourse Analysis, Intermode Differences, Second Language Learning, Time Perspective, Interpersonal Relationship, Speech Skills, Academic Achievement, Barriers, Performance Factors, Conflict", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1027978", "title": "Fostering Student Interaction and Engagement in a Virtual Learning Environment: An Investigation into Activity Design and Implementation", "author": "Hampel, Regine, Pleines, Christine", "description": "Online tools, such as forums, wikis, and blogs lend themselves to learners negotiating meaning and co-constructing knowledge through interaction. However, not enough is known about how tasks need to be designed to make best use of the possibilities of complex virtual learning environments (VLEs) to motivate and support learners, foster interaction, and contribute to knowledge construction. This article reports on a two-year study exploring the design and implementation cycle of online activities as an integral part of a distance language course. When the course was introduced in 2009, activities had been designed on the basis of second language acquisition principles as well as sociocultural theories, providing a basis for student interaction and taking into account the affordances of the environment, a Moodle-based VLE. After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners. Consequently, activities were re-designed and a number of changes were implemented in 2010 that included more teacher involvement, fewer tasks, a simpler structure, and a reduced number of tools. A comparison of learner participation across the two years shows that these changes had a positive impact on learner engagement.", "subject": "Learner Engagement, Interaction, Teaching Methods, Technology Uses in Education, Online Courses, Distance Education, Second Language Instruction, Virtual Classrooms, Student Surveys, Interviews, Diaries, Statistical Analysis, Student Attitudes, Educational Technology", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1013969", "title": "Student Training in the Use of an Online Synchronous Conferencing Tool", "author": "Heiser, Sarah, Stickler, Ursula, Furnborough, Concha", "description": "With the increase of online language teaching the training needs of teachers have long been established and researched.

The research focuses on three iterations of the learner training conducted over a 21-month period, drawing on almost 500 completed student feedback responses. The findings show that students considered the training sessions helpful in establishing how online language classes operate and gaining confidence to participate actively. Specifically they benefited from using their L1 to practice techniques for projecting their social presence in an online communicative situation, compensating for the lack of features such as body language, non-verbal communication, and spatial impressions. As for their teachers, the research demonstrated a need to reflect on the terminology used to explain CMC tools.

Findings: The AT is able to first test the hypotheses on global development and globalisation and second to suggest new hypotheses on the mechanisms of globalisation. Results can be used in curricula of Global Studies worldwide. Research limitations/implications: These data analysis has still to be complemented by sociological, political and economic theories providing insights into global restructuration processes and structural transitions through globalisation. Practical implications: &quot;Forward-looking&quot; as an emerging scientific discipline is supported by the proposed detailed analytical methods, namely by providing quantitative, in-depth techno-socio-economic megatrends.

It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications: The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field.

In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved.

Defining the internationalisation of education as an ever more significant part of globalisation, the paper insists that the education should be recognised as the foundation for sustainable development and building of the global knowledge society. Design/methodology/approach: The author presents a vision of the education as of a global &quot;soft power&quot; thus introducing a new understanding and a different application of the notion used mainly in a negative sense which, in author's opinion, can serve as educational instrument and technology of attraction. The author's methodology and approach take note of the basic principles of the globalisation theory and include the recognition of the fact that the contradiction between global interdependent problems of the planetary scale on one side and the existing rather fragmentary and desultory way of acquiring knowledge on the other side is the main challenge to the present and future quality of the human potential. Findings: Considering ways how to continue the work on ESD after the end of the UN DESD in 2014, the author expresses a point of view that it should be an innovation project requiring state, public, law and financial support.

Students can benefit from the study of information systems security when security concepts are introduced in the context of real-world industry standards. The development of a data security standard for organizations operating within the credit card payment industry serves as an excellent example of a real-world security standard that lends itself to classroom study. The establishment and requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the associated consequences for noncompliance, represents a businesslike approach to the organizational protection of data that students will find interesting and one to which they will relate. Everybody uses credit cards! Incorporating the topic of PCI DSS into an activity allows students to learn and apply PCI DSS concepts to a business setting. Just asking &quot;If everyone uses credit cards, why don&apos;t all businesses accept them?&quot; will start a process of exploration for the class. A hypothetical business teaching case, &quot;Blue Mountain Jams&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;), illustrates the challenge of PCI DSS mandates for small businesses. Small business is given some leeway in self-assessment under PCI DSS to document compliance after the decision is made to accept credit card payments. That leeway gives students the opportunity to learn and analyze the PCI DSS requirements and compliance methods and to determine the best course of action for a business that has made the decision to start accepting credit cards.", "subject": "Credit (Finance), Information Security, Retailing, Compliance (Legal), Business Administration Education", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1031212", "title": "Reading and Grammar Learning through Mobile Phones", "author": "Wang, Shudong, Smith, Simon", "description": "This paper describes an ongoing language-learning project, three years into its development.

Its goal is to help researchers in finding related works. Further, this paper seeks to explore the effect of using relational features in addition to textual features on the quality of recommended citations. Design/methodology/approach: In order to propose a novel citation recommendation system, first a new relational similarity measure is proposed for calculating the relatedness of two publications. Then, a recommendation algorithm is presented that uses both relational and textual features to compute the semantic distances of publications of a bibliographic dataset from the input text. Findings: The evaluation of the proposed system shows that combining relational features with textual features leads to better recommendations, in comparison with relying only on the textual features. It also demonstrates that citation context plays an important role among textual features. In addition, it is concluded that different relational features have different contributions to the proposed similarity measure. Originality/value: A new citation recommendation system is proposed which uses a novel semantic distance measure. This measure is based on textual similarities and a new relational similarity concept. The other contribution of this paper is that it sheds more light on the importance of citation context in citation recommendation, by providing more evidences through analysis of the results.

However, they do not usually consider external collaborations as a strategic issue despite their benefits. The purpose of this paper consists of identifying different patterns of collaboration and internationalization of universities, with the aim of helping managers and policy makers to take decisions related to their national research policies. Design/methodology/approach: Co-authorship analysis has been used in conjunction with social network analysis to model inter-institutional collaborations as networks, extracting these collaborations from the Web of Science database. Using several structural properties of the extracted networks and applying a statistical treatment, the main profiles of collaborations and internationalization have been obtained. Findings: Obtained results distinguish three patterns of collaborations according to the intensity and scope of collaborations. The statistical treatment also provides a segmentation of universities according to their collaboration profiles. Finally, universities are represented in bi-dimensional maps using external collaborations as a measure of similarity. Research limitations/implications: Although this study is restricted to English universities, it could probably be extended at least to other countries in the European Union or even other developed countries.
