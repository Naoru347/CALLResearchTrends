    "author": "Luo, Rong, Ye, Zixuan",
    "description": "This paper focuses on quality assurance in language massive open online courses (LMOOCs). It is a qualitative study that adopts the grounded theory method and analyses evaluative comments on the quality of LMOOCs from learners' perspectives. With the data collected from 1,000 evaluations from English as a second language (ESL) learners on China's biggest MOOC platform &quot;iCourse&quot;, this study examines what has influenced learners' perceptions of LMOOCs and identifies the specific quality criteria of five types of them, including ESL courses for speaking, reading, writing, cultural studies, and integrated skills. The results of the study will lay a foundation for the establishment of a quality criteria framework for LMOOCs and provide insights into design principles for effective online language courses tailored to the diverse needs of a massive number of language learners.",

    "description": "This paper focuses on automatically assessing language proficiency levels according to linguistic complexity in learner English. We implement a supervised learning approach as part of an automatic essay scoring system. The objective is to uncover Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) criterial features in writings by learners of English as a foreign language. Our method relies on the concept of microsystems with features related to learner-specific linguistic systems in which several forms operate paradigmatically. Results on internal data show that different microsystems help classify writings from A1 to C2 levels (82% balanced accuracy). Overall results on external data show that a combination of lexical, syntactic, cohesive and accuracy features yields the most efficient classification across several corpora (59.2% balanced accuracy).",

    "author": "Dziemianko, Anna",
    "description": "The aim of the paper is to investigate the usefulness of different illustration formats in online English learners' dictionaries for the accuracy and speed of meaning comprehension as well as immediate and delayed retention. In a controlled online experiment, the meaning of selected English words and phrases had to be explained with the help of purpose-built monolingual dictionary entries. Four experimental conditions were created, which reflected the presence and format of illustrations in the entries: color pictures, greyscale pictures, line drawings, no illustrations. Meaning retention was checked immediately after exposure and two weeks later. The results show that it is worthwhile to include illustrations in online learners' dictionaries and suggest the most beneficial illustration formats. Line drawings prove the most recommendable; they considerably improve meaning comprehension, reduce reception time, and stimulate the best immediate and delayed retention. Color pictures emerge as the second best. They produce results comparable with those for line drawings, except they do not help so much to remember meaning in the long run. Entries with greyscale pictures are the least recommendable. They do not contribute more to meaning comprehension and delayed retention. Yet, they even shorten reception time and help users to remember more words immediately after exposure.",

    "description": "In recent years, marked gains in the accuracy of machine translation (MT) outputs have greatly increased its viability as a tool to support the efforts of English as a foreign language (EFL) students to write in English. This study examines error corrections made by 58 Korean university students by comparing their original L2 texts to that of MT outputs. Based on the results of the error analysis, the error types were categorized into 12 categories. Students were divided into three distinctive groups to determine differences among them according to the frequency of errors in their writing. The t-test results reveal that the numbers of errors significantly decreased in the revised versions for most of the error types among all groups. The results of the regression analysis also reveal a positive correlation relationship between the number of changes and the reduction of errors. However, the results also indicate that although all groups made error corrections at similar rates, students who less frequently committed errors in their L2 texts (higher language proficiency groups) generally tended to correct a higher proportion of errors. Based on the findings, pedagogical implications are discussed regarding how EFL teachers can effectively incorporate MT into the classroom.",

    "author": "York, James, Shibata, Koichi, Tokutake, Hayato, Nakayama, Hiroshi",
    "description": "Studies on computer-mediated communication often compare the affective affordances of different technologies with face-to-face communication. This study aimed to understand how three different computer-mediated communication modalities may affect EFL learners' foreign language anxiety (FLA). Using a counterbalanced 3 by 3 factorial design, 30 undergraduate Japanese university students participated in this study, completing a spot-the-difference task in three different oral synchronous computer-mediated communication modes: voice, video, and virtual reality (VR). Upon completing each task, participants responded to an FLA questionnaire and answered questions regarding their learning experiences. Finally, a post-experiment questionnaire asked participants to explicitly compare their experiences of learning within each modality. Results suggest that although all three modes were successful in reducing learner FLA, no statistically significant differences were found between mean scores. However, the results of the learner perceptions questionnaire suggested that VR was the easiest environment to communicate in, was the most fun, and the most effective environment for language learning. Participant responses to an open-ended question suggested that learner dispositions to technology as well as their affective characteristics may be responsible for differing opinions regarding the affordances of VR for language learning. The study concludes with a call for more research in the area of learner affect and technology use, including studies that more effectively utilize the technological affordances of VR, and also qualitatively assess which elements of VR may affect learner FLA and motivation.",

    "description": "To address the challenges of limited language proficiency and provide necessary feedback in the implementation of task-based language teaching (TBLT), a mobile-supported TBLT application was developed to provide linguistic and task scaffolding. Sixty-six English as a foreign language (EFL) university learners participated in a three-week experiment as part of a general English course. They were assigned to either an experimental group (mobile-supported TBLT), which received TBLT with scaffolds built into the application, or a control group (traditional TBLT), which received traditional paper-based TBLT without the scaffolds. At the end of the experiment, an English achievement test of vocabulary, grammar, and conversation comprehension was administered to determine if the technological scaffolds enhanced the learning outcomes for the course. Students' self-perceived use of oral communication strategies was also measured to explore how these scaffolds affected the conversational interaction essential for task performance. Results showed that the mobile-supported TBLT group outperformed the traditional TBLT group on the vocabulary and conversation comprehension tests but not so much on the grammar test. Also, the mobile-supported TBLT group reported greater awareness of fluency- and accuracy-oriented strategies for speaking than the traditional TBLT group. Implications for designing mobile learning to enhance TBLT in an EFL setting are drawn.",

This longitudinal study investigated Arab Gulf EFL student teachers' immediate and long-term responses to corpus literacy instruction. After teaching a corpus literacy component to two classes of student teachers in a graduate computer-assisted language learning course they attended, the author collected focus group data about their views on this instruction and their own expected future uses of corpora in language learning, teaching and research. Two years later, a group of these student teachers (n = 19) responded to a follow-up questionnaire exploring their beliefs about corpus literacy integration and their multiple uses of corpora. The student teachers reported very positive immediate and long-term perceptions of corpus literacy instruction, but it was found that such instruction has not brought about all the desired changes in their long-term uses of online corpora as a linguistic and pedagogical resource, or their attitudes towards doing corpus-based TESOL research. However, it is expected that the popularization benefits gained from corpus literacy integration could lead to better future developments in using corpora for language education and research purposes in the target context.",

    "description": "The present study aims to verify the impact of dynamic aids on learning L2 prepositions in relation to individual learner variables. Situated within the cognitive linguistics (CL) framework and differing from previous research, the present study hypothesizes that dynamic (animated) aids are not equally effective for all learners; rather, their effectiveness differs according to learners' first languages (L1s) (Chinese or Japanese) and information-processing styles (verbalizers or imagers). To verify this hypothesis, we utilized learning materials comprised of static and dynamic images for three English spatial prepositions (&quot;above,&quot; &quot;on,&quot; &quot;over&quot;). After conducting a Style of Processing questionnaire, we administered three cloze tests (pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest) of target words to Taiwanese and Japanese participants (N = 109), whose L1s differed in terms of their linguistic proximity to English. Although no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in tests for all participants, the results were differentiated by individual factors. In results of a two-way ANOVA, Taiwanese participants showed significantly greater improvement from the pretest to posttest than Japanese participants when the participants used dynamic images, whereas the Japanese group made more learning gains from the posttest to the delayed posttest test. Moreover, imagers obtained more benefits from the visual aids, whether static or dynamic, than verbalizers. Our findings indicate that CL-based visual aids are beneficial and that individual factors, especially learners' L1, may produce different learning effects, especially in multimedia environments.",

The research design is a context-specific case study using D\u00f6rnyei's (2005) categories of learning strategies as the conceptual and analytical framework to guide data collection and analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a questionnaire from a sample of 75 Chinese EFL learners and a small-scale follow-up interview of five participants who completed the questionnaire. Data showed that a mobile-technology-assisted environment effected changes in Chinese EFL learners' ways of adopting a particular set of learning strategies, which differed in type and frequency from those typical of a teacher-led and examination-oriented language classroom. Metacognitive and commitment control strategies were most frequently used by the respondents in this study. The frequency of student use of metacognitive strategies moved ahead of commitment and environmental control strategies. Satiation and emotion control strategies, rarely used by Chinese students in a teacher-fronted language classroom, were also observable. These findings have implications for the understanding and designing of mobile-technology-assisted learning for EFL learners to develop appropriate strategies for autonomous learning.",

This paper describes the design process of the tandemMOOC, which exploits the massive, open and online features of MOOCs in order to offer language learners online speaking interaction practice with native speakers of their target language. The course is based on eTandem language learning principles and equips learners with the necessary competences to be able to cope with online second language (L2) speaking opportunities. Following a design-based research approach, this paper presents an analysis and discussion of seven components of the design: learning environment, facilitation dynamics, dyad configuration, task types, task topics, feedback provision, and gamification components. The analysis of the implementation of these elements results in a set of key features for the integration of L2 speaking interaction activities in LMOOCs.",

    "description": "In an increasingly ageing, multilingual, and digitalised society, there is still a lack of research on older adults' adoption and use of mobile technology for supporting their self-directed second language learning. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which seniors residing in Germany (aged 60+) engage in mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) and the factors encouraging or discouraging them from using language learning apps by conducting a web-based survey (n = 208) and a series of in-depth individual interviews (n = 22). Our results show that (1) participants were resistant to fully embrace the potential of MALL despite their active engagement in language learning and extensive use of digital technology, online resources, and mobile devices; and (2) self-perceived digital literacy and openness towards new developments are strong factors favouring the use of language learning apps in older adulthood. We interpret and discuss these results in the light of theoretical accounts of mobile learning and education in (older) adults, emphasising the need to consider the specific requirements of late-life learners in future implementations of language learning apps. Based on our results, we highlight several implications for designers and developers of such apps intended to facilitate full inclusion of seniors as mobile language learners.",

In this paper, we report on the dynamics of participation and learner behaviour in an ab initio Irish language course. The course, Irish 101, ran during March 2019, and we used a mixed-methods approach to analyse both typical patterns of behaviour among course participants and learner reflections upon their reasons for doing so. Findings suggest that most learners use the course resources in an assessing and exploratory manner and are far less likely to produce, or to examine, second language (L2) output, either written or spoken. Learners were found to be selective and to demonstrate significant metacognitive awareness (Wenden, 1998) in their interactions and learning methods, displaying agency and exploiting affordances beyond the design of the course itself. Implications for LMOOC design, including the need to question whether courses should emphasise L2 production or resource provision, are considered, in addition to a general need for more granular, dynamic research, so as to better understand the types of learners who engage in LMOOCs and to better cater to diverse learning needs.",

The overall effect size for using technology to learn L2 vocabulary was d = 0.64, which is a moderate effect size. The Q statistic indicated a significant variability in effect size, so we followed up with a theory-driven moderator analysis. The results of the moderator analysis revealed that learners benefited more from technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning with incidental instruction than with intentional instruction; types of assessment were not significant moderators of the effect on technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning; technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning is more effective when the target language is close to the learner's first language; college students benefited more from technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning than K--12 students; and, finally, mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning was more effective than computer-assisted L2 vocabulary learning.",

    "author": "Ballance, Oliver James",
    "description": "Narrow reading has the potential to reduce vocabulary load and to provide rich opportunities for developing collocation knowledge, but these benefits rely on narrow reading increasing lexical repetition within a text. Hence, interest in narrow reading has been limited by the relatively small lexical effect of narrowing reading by topic (Nation, 2013). Nevertheless, research in data-driven learning and teaching and language corpora has reported positively on learners using concordances in a manner comparable to narrow reading. However, the potential for concordances to provide an increased lexical-repetition effect has not been assessed. This study bridges this gap by exploring the degree of lexical repetition available in concordances and identifies corpus composition as a key predictor of lexical repetition. The study uses standardised type-token ratio (sTTR) to analyse concordances extracted from corpora at three different levels of homogeneity/heterogeneity. The results show large, reliable variations in lexical repetition resulting from variation in corpus homogeneity/heterogeneity, and so identifies concordance-based narrow reading as a possible means of overcoming the limitations of traditional narrow reading by topic. The results are discussed with reference to pedagogical implications for language learners, teachers, and researchers.",

The study seeks to explore the impact of factors associated with the course's instructional design on engagement and retention and reveal crucial determinants of attrition.

It builds on previous studies on student engagement and retention in LMOOCs (Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir, 2018, 2019). The present study identified six content-specific factors that the majority of participants considered to be important for their motivation. Some factors, such as gradual and scaffolded presentation of input, had a positive impact on retention. Furthermore, statements from learners in the study who disengaged before completing show that non-course-related factors, such as time constraints, affect LMOOC retention. The study provides a new framework for how to promote student engagement and suggests specific strategies for other LMOOC developers.",

It answers three research questions: (1) what are learners' motivations and goals for joining these LMOOCs and how do these relate to foreign language speaking anxiety; (2) how do learners' self-efficacy beliefs and anxiety levels change as a result of course completion; and (3) is there a correlation between motivation, foreign language speaking anxiety, and self-efficacy beliefs in this context? A mixed-methods research design used quantitative and qualitative data gathered from self-reflective questionnaires and forum discussions. The results reveal that learners with intrinsic motivation are more likely to complete the courses than those who sign up to manage a personal situation or advance in their career or studies. No direct correlation was, however, found between motivation and the other variables under scrutiny. Learners present higher self-efficacy beliefs at the end of the courses than at the beginning, while anxiety levels are affected to a much smaller degree by course completion. Although spoken interactions in this learning environment are not synchronous, apprehension and anxiety prevent many learners from fully participating in the speaking activities.",

First, a distributed association strategy (DAS) for the associative learning of L2 learners based on distributed language learning is analyzed, and a dynamic vocabulary network model based on DAS is constructed. Second, by analyzing the topological parameters, the external form and overall characteristics of the vocabulary network and three questions regarding its impact on vocabulary acquisition are discussed. A case study involving the foreign language learning and teaching of undergraduate students is used to illustrate this method. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reflect the associative learning process of acquiring vocabulary. Results also reveal the dynamic and evolutionary laws governing vocabulary networks when using ALS, as well as small world and scale-free characteristics.",

The results indicated the complex relationships between the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, e-learning motivation, online communication self-efficacy and language learners' acceptance and readiness of e-learning. Furthermore, the findings revealed that perceived enjoyment did not have influence on e-learning acceptance and readiness among language learners through the mediating role of perceived usefulness.",

    "description": "Although digital game-based vocabulary learning (DGBVL) has attracted considerable attention, factors attributing to the facilitative effects of DGBVL have not yet been satisfactorily understood. To this end, under the theoretical framework of flow theory, this study investigates the effects of flow experiences on Chinese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners' learning outcomes. Specifically, this study explores the influences of learner factors (balance of skill and challenge, and clear goal) and contextual factors (feedback and playability) on learners' flow experiences, such as concentration, intrinsic motivation and enjoyment. It also examines the effects of flow experiences on learners' perceived learning and satisfaction. Based on a survey of 291 Chinese EFL learners who used a DGBVL APP (application) named &quot;Baicizhan,&quot; the results demonstrated that balance of skill and challenge, clear goal and playability provided by the DGBVL have a positive effect on concentration. Feedback positively influences intrinsic motivation. Moreover, both concentration and intrinsic motivation positively affect perceived learning and satisfaction, but enjoyment only positively influences perceived learning rather than satisfaction. Lastly, satisfaction is positively affected by perceived learning. Implications of the findings are also discussed.",

    "description": "Despite the rapid development of telecollaboration in foreign language education, telecollaborative exchanges involving Chinese as the target language have not received sufficient attention. Adopting an action research approach, this study focuses on examining the student perceptions as well as the challenges of a carefully designed Chinese-American telecollaborative learning program involving Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) students at a small liberal arts college in the US and Chinese-speaking English majors at a large university in China. This study drew on a variety of data for analysis, including naturally occurring interaction data (i.e., Skype conversations, WeChat group discussion transcripts), students' weekly reflection journals, informal interviews with the students throughout the semester, end-of-program interviews, student responses to an end-of-semester questionnaire, and the teacher-researcher reflective journal. The results showed that this program was, in general, well received among the CFL students at the US college. The intermediate-level CFL students evaluated this program more positively than the elementary-level students. However, this program also faced many challenges, such as scheduling and technological issues with Skype conversations, target language proficiency gap, perceived irrelevance to Chinese proficiency development, heavy workload, lack of depth in WeChat group discussion, and the demanding role of the teacher-researcher.",

    "author": "Mehri Kamrood, Ali, Davoudi, Mohammad, Ghaniabadi, Saeed, Amirian, Seyyed Mohammad Reza",
    "description": "Dynamic Assessment (DA) is proposed as a workable diagnostic tool in second or foreign language context. Compared to traditional non-dynamic testing, DA presents a more comprehensive account of human beings' abilities through addressing both the fully internalized abilities and the abilities that are in the process of being internalized. However, a major problem with the application of ordinary DA procedures is their limited capacity for addressing larger contexts in terms of learners and constructs. Computerized Dynamic Assessment (C-DA) is suggested as a solution for the practicality concerns associated with DA procedures. Considering lack of research in this regard, this study reports the results of designing and implementing an interventionist online computerized dynamic test of English listening skill for Iranian EFL university students. The online multiple-choice C-DA software has been designed following Poehner, M. E., &amp; Lantolf, J. P. (2013). Bringing the zone of proximal development (ZPD) into the equation: Capturing L2 development during computerized dynamic assessment (C-DA). Language Teaching Research, 17(3), 323-342 and Poehner, M. E., Zhang, J., &amp; Lu, X. (2015). Computerized dynamic assessment (C-DA): Diagnosing L2 development according to learner responsiveness to mediation. Language Testing, 32(3), 337-321. The software presents learners with ZPD-based mediation via hints and prompts and generates an actual score reporting their independent performance; a mediated score reporting their mediated performance; and a learning potential score (LPS) reporting the gain between the actual and mediated scores. The results revealed a significant difference between learners' actual and mediated scores indicating the inadequacy of non-dynamic testing in accounting for learners' responsiveness to mediation. Moreover, LPS could differentiate among learners classified into the same level by non-dynamic testing. The analysis of each learner's scoring profile plus their LPS proved conducive to diagnosing their strengths and weaknesses in different language constructs included in the test and could help teachers develop fine-tuned individualized learning plans and materials for future learning.",

    "description": "The article reports on a study that incorporated an immersive 3D virtual environment, created in Second Life (SL) into the curriculum of a Chinese program, including its development, implementation and evaluation. This innovation supplemented classroom teaching of Chinese language throughout one semester at a regional Australian university. Using the existing resource called Chinese Island (CI) created by a major urban Australian university, the primary aim of this study was to probe student's perceptions about the resource. Due to curriculum differences between two universities, customised language and culture learning tasks based on the learnt textbook content were designed on CI, with instructions and associated quizzes hosted in a private Moodle site--a widely-used learning management system (LMS) environment. Twenty-eight mixed-level undergraduate Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) students participated in a survey, and seven of these students were interviewed. The questionnaire and interview data were collected and analysed during the study. Following analysis, results indicated that students welcomed the experiential learning opportunity to explore Chinese culture and language outside the classroom afforded by CI. Anecdotal evidence suggested that students became more aware of the complicated pragmatic issues in real life communication. The survey results, including the participants' responses to open-ended questions, are discussed in this paper. Pedagogical implications and directions for further research are also considered.",

    "description": "Corrective feedback (CF) can be provided to learners in different ways (explicit or implicit, focused or unfocused) and is the subject of major controversies in second language acquisition research. As no clear consensus has been reached so far about the most effective approach to CF with a view to fostering accuracy in second language (L2) writing -- and as this also holds true for blended learning environments -- our study aims at investigating the optimal conditions for effective CF in an experimental blended learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) course. To explore this question, 93 study participants from Sorbonne Universit\u00e9 (Paris, France) were divided up into seven groups: six treatment groups which received six different online CF types and one control group which received no CF. A performance comparison in terms of accuracy between the study participants' first and last pieces of writing was carried out to analyse the relative effectiveness of the different CF strategies. The results show that any type of CF is better than no CF at all, and that the repeated provision of unfocused indirect CF (with metalinguistic comments on the nature of errors) combined with extra computer-mediated micro-tasks over a certain period of time (24 weeks) seems to be the most efficient CF type in our context. This also points to the usefulness of integrating tutorial CALL activities in the CF provided as these seem to impact output accuracy positively.",

    "description": "Innovation in technology-enhanced language learning environments has been largely driven by the affordances of new tools and rich, smart learning environments alongside the use of everyday tools. Such technology-mediated environments open up further ways of researching and enhancing language learning and call for new methodological and conceptual tools to support the investigation of learning in productive ways. The focus of this article is to present a model to guide enquiry into and practice within one-to-one synchronous online language teaching via videoconferencing. The model has been derived from an ongoing study undertaken by the authors, so as each element is explained, brief excerpts of data from that study are provided to illustrate the personal, interpersonal and situational complexities that influence teachers' and learners' actions and interactions. The multi-layered nature of the framework uncovers different aspects of the interactions which provide affordances for learning within this multimodal language-learning environment. It draws on key concepts of sociocultural theory, including a situated investigation of agency in relation to language use and environmental factors. We argue that the model we have developed can provide useful conceptual and practical tools to guide enquiry into technology-enhanced language learning environments and teacher awareness of the affordances and emergent complexities of those environments.",

However, little has been explored about English as a second language (ESL) teachers' ICT adoption. This study synthesizes the technology acceptance model (TAM), the value-expectancy theory, and a learning perspective to propose a model -for investigating ESL teachers' continuance intention to use ICT in teaching. In the proposed model, motivational beliefs, ICT learning behaviors, facilitating conditions, and perceptions towards ICT use were put together to see how they worked together to influence continuance intention. Participants were 156 primary school ESL teachers in Hong Kong, who attended a teacher professional development program. Structural equation modeling showed that ICT self-efficacy and facilitating conditions were positively associated with continuance intention through perceptions (i.e. perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness). ICT anxiety had a negative effect, whereas interest had a positive effect on continuance intention. Growth mindset had a positive effect on continuance intention through learning of ICT (i.e. adaptive help seeking). Implications for teachers' professional development programs are discussed.",

    "description": "Web-based collaborative writing (CW) has been widely used in the field of English as a foreign language (EFL) during the last decade. Previous studies have mainly focused on how online platforms have facilitated the CW process for EFL learners, how web-based CW has shown progress in EFL learners' writing development, and how EFL learners in groups interact with one another during web-based CW. However, there are limited studies on web-based CW among Turkish EFL learners. The aim of this study was to analyse Turkish high school EFL learners' self-reported accounts of their writing process in English with the support of group leaders in a web-based CW activity. The key findings were that first, the groups found the need to elect a group leader to act as a facilitator for other group members, and that group members found their group leader's help in planning their writing tasks and corrective feedback useful for their learning; second, group leaders provided affective support during the writing activity, with group members reporting that praise and motivational phrases received from their group leaders increased their self-confidence and motivation towards writing in English. This study contributes to knowledge about improving high school EFL learners' writing through a web-based CW activity. The peer leadership approach is promising in supporting student's self-efficacy and self-regulation in learning and is easily applicable to teachers in other contexts who wish to promote writing activities outside of the classroom setting.",

An important component of these layered contexts is societal discourses of technology, which are multiple and far from neutral. In response to these calls, this study examines how students at one San Francisco Bay Area high school understand technology in foreign language learning and how these beliefs relate to regional discourses of technology. The study assumed an ecological theoretical frame and deployed a multi-pronged research design: a survey study (n = 283), a case study (n = 3), and a discourse analysis of a regional newspaper corpus (n = 372). Findings indicate that students held largely utilitarian beliefs about CALL that both aligned with and diverged from regional discourses. Instances of alignment suggest the potential influence of larger societal discourses on student beliefs about CALL while instances of divergence underscore the need to address the larger role of technology in society when considering CALL beliefs and practices.",

    "author": "Garc\u00eda Botero, Gustavo, Botero Restrepo, Margarita Alexandra, Zhu, Chang, Questier, Frederik",
    "description": "Learners need diligence when going solo in technology-enhanced learning environments. Nevertheless, self-regulation and scaffolding are two under-researched concepts when it comes to mobile learning. To tackle this knowledge gap, this study focuses on self-regulation and scaffolding for mobile assisted language learning (MALL). Fifty-two students of French as a foreign language were divided into one control and two experimental groups. The two experimental groups were invited to engage in voluntary language learning through a language platform, Duolingo. One of the two experimental groups was trained for self-regulation and received scaffolding for their MALL. The study reveals five main findings: First, students who were trained in self-regulation and received temporary scaffolding present a significantly higher participation in Duolingo. Second, self-regulation features provided by Duolingo are not frequently used by students and therefore do not substantially contribute to students' own learning micromanagement. Third, there is a correlation between high use of Duolingo and improvement in French writing skills. Fourth, just inviting students to engage in voluntary out-of-class MALL does not result in higher test scores for French listening, reading or writing skills. Fifth, in a MALL context, self-regulation training and temporary scaffolding contribute to higher test scores in French writing. Overall, the results suggest that training and scaffolding for self-regulation is beneficial in a voluntary out-of-class MALL context. However, more research is needed to analyze in which conditions voluntary out-of-class MALL can lead to substantial learning improvements.",

    "description": "Despite the increasing ownership of mobile devices among Chinese postgraduate EFL learners, relevant studies regarding mobile English learning resources (MELR) use by postgraduate learners are still lacking. This study tries to understand the uses and the motivation behind language learners' selection of MALL resources. In this research, 95 Chinese postgraduate students from four university levels took part in a questionnaire, and eight of them in an interview. The results show that &quot;passing exams&quot; was the top reason for using MELR and expanding one's English vocabulary was the aspect learners aimed to improve. The portability of mobile devices enabled learners to use MELR during short time intervals, which suggests that MALL applications should target this behaviour. However, as a type of supplementary material, few students used MELR for more than one hour per day, and they were not regularly and actively involved in using MELR. Few learners were able to select suitable MELR to meet their current English learning needs, and they relied on recommendations from social media and authoritative education experts. Due to the importance of vocabulary, mobile dictionaries and vocabulary learning applications were the learners' favourite type of MELR. As the participants suggested, enjoyment and interactivity were the two driving factors behind MELR selection and use. On the basis of Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME, Koole, M. (2009). A model for framing mobile learning. In M. Ally (Ed.), &quot;Mobile learning: Transforming the delivery of education and training.&quot; Athabasca: Athabasca University Press, 25-47) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM [Davis, F. D., (1989).

A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies. Management Science, 46(2), 186-204]), a new theoretical model for better understanding the complex nature of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) and the importance of learners in the self-directed, non-formal English language learning setting is proposed in this study.",

    "author": "Hava, Kevser",
    "description": "This study aims to explore the effects of digital storytelling on student motivation and satisfaction levels in EFL education. It also investigates students' opinions on the use of digital storytelling in learning environments. In this pre-experimental study, a group of pre-service teachers (n = 60) created three digital stories about countries, nature, and sports within a 9-week implementation process. The motivation scale and digital storytelling satisfaction questionnaire were used as data collection tools. At the beginning and the end of the implementation process, the students were assessed on their motivation level of self-confidence, personal use, and attitude domains. The results showed that there were significant improvements in students' self-confidence and personal use after digital storytelling activity. For self-confidence and personal use, paired-samples t-test pointed out small effect sizes while for attitude, the changes were not significant. It is also found that digital storytelling could be beneficial for facilitating vocabulary learning, writing and speaking skills in EFL education. Overall, results show that digital storytelling might be an important and effective tool that can be utilized in learning environments to support the development of students' both language and digital skills.",

    "title": "Using Patterns-Based Learning Design for CALL Tasks",
    "author": "Sun, Susan Y. H.",
    "description": "The purpose of this paper is to present a specific case of CALL task design adopting the patterns-based learning design approach. The approach provides a common framework/vocabulary for educational designers, particularly teachers, to systematically capture, articulate, make explicit, share and reuse expert knowledge of teaching and good design. Over the past 10-15 years, considerable advances have been made in both learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) research in terms of research outputs. However, the anticipated impact and benefits, e.g. the patterns-based approach, to the everyday practice of teachers and learners have been invisible or mostly unrealized. Research to explore CALL task design with reference to LD and LA is underrepresented in the literature. The aim of this paper is to explain the challenges faced by CALL designers/teachers in task design and reflect on them methodologically with relation to the patterns-based approach. It firstly provides an overview of the CALL task design literature to highlight the gaps and weaknesses in the research and practice, followed by an introduction of the concept of &quot;design patterns.&quot; This paper then examines three CALL tasks from two current online language learning beginners courses in a New Zealand university, and develops them into design patterns. Explanation of how they were developed and discussion of the possible added value of design pattern to the design of CALL tasks are provided.",

    "title": "Using Collocation Clusters to Detect and Correct English L2 Learners&apos; Collocation Errors",
    "author": "Huang, Ping-Yu, Tsao, Nai-Lung",
    "description": "In this article, we describe an online English collocation explorer developed to help English L2 learners produce correct and appropriate collocations. Our tool, which is able to visually represent relevant correct/incorrect collocations on a single webpage, was designed based on the notions of collocation clusters and intercollocability proposed by Cowie and Howarth. As they pointed out, in a collocation cluster L2 learners generally cannot distinguish true collocations (e.g., &quot;tell truth,&quot; &quot;state truth,&quot; and &quot;state fact&quot;) from impossible combinations (e.g., *&quot;say fact&quot; and *&quot;say truth&quot;). Accordingly, our tool applies natural language processing techniques to construct collocation clusters to enable learners to easily differentiate between correct and incorrect pairs. Relying on data from a reference corpus, our system instantaneously processes the collocability of users' target combination (verb-noun or adj-noun) and all other relevant words and presents true/false collocations that L2 learners should master/avoid. To assess our tool, we investigated its performance in detecting and correcting learners' V-N and A-N errors, with results comparable to those of most previous studies. Piloted using a sample of 13 intermediate- or upper-intermediate level English as a foreign language learners, our tool was found to help them self-correct their collocation errors effectively. Compared with similar tools or approaches, our tool requires much less data resources, but still demonstrates a remarkable capability to detect/correct errors and generate useful collocational knowledge in English.",

    "description": "Given the importance of word knowledge for second language acquisition, there is always a need for effective word-learning approaches from language learners. With the rapid development of educational technologies, game-based learning is emerging into a field with considerable potential, within which, digital game-based vocabulary learning has accrued increasing attention from language learners, educators and researchers. The present research reviews studies on digital game-based vocabulary learning from five perspectives: a general overview of published studies, digital games for vocabulary learning, theoretical frameworks, research issues and findings, and implications. Using specific criteria for article selection, 21 publications in SSCI journals were finalized for the systematic review. Findings revealed 10 types of digital games dominate the field, and these generally demonstrate positive effects in promoting short-term and long-term vocabulary learning, facilitating reading and listening comprehension, increasing motivation and engagement, decreasing anxiety and fostering interactions among learners. These findings further render implications that are meaningful for vocabulary learning and game design.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effects of the flipped classroom model on EFL learner autonomy in a content-based instructional context. The participants involved were students enrolled in two linguistics classes, divided into an experimental group (n = 64) which received a flipped classroom (FC) instruction and a control group (n = 60) taught in a non-flipped classroom. In the FC, various functions were embedded in a Moodle course management system (CMS), including video lectures, online quizzes, resources and e-journals. The comparison between the pre- and post-questionnaire on perceived learner autonomy showed no difference between the groups prior to instruction; however, significant statistical differences were found between the groups following instruction, especially in the constructs of learner autonomous strategy, learner behavior and learner confidence. The examination of e-journals revealed that learner autonomy had been improved in terms of strategy use, behavior, interaction with the materials, the use of social resources and self-management of learning. The CMS log analysis showed significant correlations between online learning activities and perceived learner autonomy. Furthermore, the data collected from the pre- and post-questionnaires, e-journal and interviews were analysed and interpreted to explain the fostered learner autonomy from psychological, technical, sociocultural and political-critical perspectives.",

This study adopts a design-based research approach to investigate the pedagogical needs, the critical features and usability of such a authoring system. Twelve adult participants, including EFL teachers, parents, non-technical, and technical professionals, voluntarily participated in this study to co-develop and evaluated the authoring system through iterations of needs collection, system design, system testing and refinements. An authoring system, consisting of IoT-based toys, a robot and a script editor, was finally developed taking four cycles of iterative improvements in 18 weeks. Eleven pedagogical needs concerning children's language and cognitive development, better children-robot interaction and practical issues were identified. The modifications made across different versions of the authoring system were presented in detail. The results also show that the issues of effectiveness, robustness and efficiency were the most frequently identified, and that the system had achieved good usability after four rounds of design and refinements. Design principles and guidelines also merged as a result providing insights into the effective design of Robot Assisted Language Learning in particular and Technology-Enhanced Language Learning in general.",

    "description": "Web-based writing tools, which allow multiple writers to share and edit the same document, have attracted significant attention as computer-assisted language learning tools in the past decade. However, how L2 writers contribute to the shared document as a social action for interacting with other cowriters remains underexplored in L2 research. Inspired by conversation analysis, in this study, I conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of online, text-based (nonspeaking) asynchronous multiparty interactions consisting of two interactional modes: chat-based discussions and writing records displayed on the screen, with the aim of determining the methods employed by L2 learners to contribute writing changes over time. The data were taken from the online interactions of a group of nine or ten English as a foreign language university learners, who were asked to collaboratively write an essay in English, with the focus being on three learners to elucidate the changes in the methods used. The data analysis indicated that, over the course of the task, the participants used a greater number of methods to make their writing contribution to the entire essay more recognizable; these efforts included announcing the theme of the writing contribution, requesting corrections, and displaying alignment with an essay-in-progress by using a cohesive device in their writing, along with a variety of linguistic and semiotic repertoires. I also discuss the effects of the interlocutors on the online interactional competence of the individual learners.",

    "description": "This study explores the role of glosses and working memory capacity (WM) in second language (L2) learners' recall and comprehension in electronic reading. Glosses were investigated in terms of the type of information they provided (lexical versus topic-level) and their location on the screen (pop-up window versus separate window). One hundred-twenty highly proficient participants were classified into high- and low-WM groups and were assigned to one of the four treatment conditions, namely pop-up window topic-level glosses, separate window topic-level glosses, pop-up window lexical glosses, separate window lexical glosses. The participants were asked to read an electronic text while a built-in tracking software recorded their interactions. After reading, the participants were given a free recall task and a multiple choice comprehension test. Findings showed that the effects of gloss content depended on the type of task used to gauge comprehension while the effect of gloss location was less clear-cut. Additionally, WM capacity played a major role in comprehension. Probing into the participants' use of annotations revealed that lexical glosses led to longer reading times and pop-up conditions triggered more frequent look-up behavior.

    "description": "This article reports the study of a novel way of raising tertiary-level students' native cultural awareness (NCA) via an informal mobile learning community. Through two cycles of action research at a teacher-education university in East China, the study drew upon the Community of Practice (CoP) theory to form a synchronous English chat group. Students were encouraged to share their understandings and to construct knowledge of Chinese cultural topics with teacher guidance while using WeChat. To probe the students' perceptions of how the WeChat learning community influenced cultural exchange and learning, chat logs, semi-structured interviews data and a teacher's journal were analyzed. Findings suggest that the CoP concept played a positive role in raising NCA among the participants. Students became more willing to participate in their English chat community with a rise of trust and familiarity of group members over time. Students were motivated to use their personal, local and world knowledge through peer and multimodal discussions in order to share and learn new English expressions within a Chinese cultural context. Areas of improvement and pedagogical implications for building online CoPs with WeChat applications are discussed at the end of the article.",

This study experimented such a practice in an EFL college context applying a problem-based approach. Sophomore English majors were engaged in recursive reading and writing processes to relearn Taiwan through orchestrating the collected multimodal resources and creating a multimodal text so as to awaken the target audience's interest. Findings from both corpus and qualitative analyses revealed that (1) students developed language richness in vocabulary use, sentential complexity, and overall expressive fluency through the practice and (2) the interactive and recursive reading-writing processes had a great impact on the design of the project with multimodal materials, which exerted intertextuality among texts and enhanced the quality of the final project. By supporting with a meticulous scaffolding mechanism, such a multiliteracies project indeed encouraged more autonomous learning among students who experienced a full authorship during the process and finally created works that were authentic and unique.",

    "description": "While intercultural learning is a key goal of study abroad, it is often difficult to assess or even achieve. Recent models, such as linguistic landscapes (which looks at the language of public signs, including road signs, advertising billboards, street, and place names), can help students reflect on and make sense of their intercultural experiences in more intentional ways. By working through tasks based on the four areas of social pedagogies, which serves as the framework for this study, students became more aware of their surroundings and documented their linguistic landscape visually and in digital form. They posted their findings to Padlet, a social media tool, which allowed students access to a collaborative and co-constructive participatory culture. Open coding was used to identify two themes that emerged from the data: (1) students became aware of their surroundings; and (2) students developed a sense of cultural awareness. We also comment on how students reflected on the project. Students noticed otherwise unobvious aspects of culture and used those observations to shape their own ideas about the target culture as they worked toward constructing an intellectual community through engagement with different perspectives. Finally, students gained skills in intercultural learning as they reevaluated both their own and the target cultures while considering new perspectives as well as historical and cultural contexts.",

    "author": "Reynolds, Barry Lee, Kao, Chian-Wen",
    "description": "Feedback researchers have given little attention to how administration of language-focused instruction before writing in a second language combined with subsequent error correction after writing can affect the grammatical accuracy of learners' future writing. Moreover, the mode of the instruction (i.e., teacher instruction or game-based instruction) has also been undervalued. To address these gaps in the research literature, Taiwanese university student participants (n = 45) were randomly and equally divided into two experimental and one control group: &quot;teacher instruction with error correction&quot;; &quot;digital game-based instruction with error correction&quot;; and &quot;error correction only.&quot; Participants were asked to write three letters of application to three similar job advertisements as a pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest. Gain score results in the immediate posttest showed that the &quot;teacher instruction with error correction&quot; group significantly outperformed the &quot;error correction only&quot; group whereas gains in the delayed posttest showed the &quot;teacher instruction with error correction&quot; and the &quot;digital game-based instruction with error correction&quot; groups significantly outperformed the &quot;error correction only&quot; group. Results indicate that pedagogical practices that provide focused grammatical instruction with direct focused feedback are more beneficial to L2 writers than only providing error correction. Furthermore, the just-in-time grammar feedback provided during game play afforded learners with opportunities to engage in awareness-raising language related episodes. Such game play combined with written corrective feedback resulted in stronger retention of grammatical knowledge compared to learners that received teacher instruction combined with written corrective feedback.",

    "description": "This article presents an analysis of tracking and survey data collected over eight years on 400 users of one of seven &quot;Icelandic Online&quot; (IOL) courses: &quot;IOL 2&quot;; an open online program in Icelandic as a second language. The course is offered in three delivery modes; blended, distance, and open self-directed mode. This article introduces the second phase of a three-tiered mixed-method study and follows up previous findings on &quot;IOL&quot; that drew on tracking data from 43,000 learners, which revealed overall low completion rates and that the blended mode is more effective in retaining learners than other modes (Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir, 2018). The main goal of the current study is to identify factors which may affect student retention on &quot;IOL,&quot; and which may explain why the blended mode is more effective. This study attempts to assess whether (a) the initial goal to complete a course and (b) certain tutor-specific factors influence retention, and also to investigate (c) self-reported motives that drive learners towards completing. The findings reveal that the intent to complete is a significant predictor of course completion and that the majority of blended learners had the initial goal of completing. Furthermore, the study illuminates that most of the learners in the tutorial modes report that tutor-specific factors were important in motivating them. Finally, course completers report diverse reasons for completion; the majority of the blended learners are driven in their goal to complete by the credits offered.",

The current study begins to fill these gaps in the literature. Fifty graduate students enrolled in the course called Academic Writing participated in the study. The study collected and analyzed quantitative data from student writer drafts and revisions, the lecturer's model e-comments, and peer e-comments. The study found that qualified e-comments (revision-oriented comments) addressing global issues as opposed to local issues in student writing were different in statistically significant ways during the peer comment activities of the course. The effects of lecturer e-comments and peer e-comments on student writer revisions, however, showed no statistically significant differences. The study indicates that the lecturer's model e-comments had great effect in improving the peer commenting skills and writing quality of the graduate student writers. The effect of two incidentals, contributing factors, increased exposure time and reduced instructor load, are briefly discussed.",

Two chat groups were created, one on each application, where 32 students in each group participated in daily interaction over four months. Pre and post surveys analysing students' engagement were given to participants in both groups. Messages were tracked and samples of both types of communication were used to explore differences between the two environments. An end-of-course survey was also used to evaluate students' perceptions of the interaction as well as each of the contexts under investigation. Findings highlighted significant differences between cognitive engagement and emotional engagement in the computer and mobile environments. Furthermore, differences between the two environments were also found regarding timing, perceived value of the interaction, use and participation.",

Both environments were constructed using the Reading for Creating and Talking for Revising writing model, which has helped students overcome writing difficulties. The GWE provided management-related game elements and a game-based feedback mechanism in the form of peer response and created a setting in which students could engage in more writing activity, pay more attention to their writing, and improve their writing skills. The results indicated that the experimental group performed better than the control group in referential cohesion and in terms of their affective, challenge, and qualified attitudes.

    "description": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the influences of a six-stage story structure (4S) approach on elementary students' story production. To this end, the 4S approach was developed and realized in the form of paper-based and digital storybooks based on scaffolding theory. Specifically, the students learned the six-stage story structure (i.e. setting, theme, attempt, consequence, climax, and resolution) from a number of stories in the dual tasks (i.e. the use of digital storybook after the use of paper-based storybook) and then applied this structure to create their own stories. To address the influence of the 4S approach, forty-nine fifth-grade students participated in a quasi-experimental study for seven 40-minute sessions over 2 weeks. The students in the Experimental Group using the 4S approach were compared with those in the Control Group without the 4S approach. The findings revealed that the 4S approach helps students' story quality, interests, and attitudes. Some implications and limitations are also discussed in this paper.",

    "description": "The computer science (CS) unplugged approach intends to teach CS concepts and computational thinking skills without employing any digital tools. The current study conducted a systematic literature review to analyze research studies that conducted investigations related to implementations of CS unplugged activities. A systematic review procedure was developed and applied to detect and subsequently review relevant research studies published from 2010 to 2019. It was found that 55 research studies (17 articles + 38 conference proceedings) satisfied the inclusion criteria for the analysis. These research studies were then examined with regard to their demographic characteristics, research methodologies, research results, and main findings. It was found that the unplugged approach was realized and utilized differently among researchers. The majority of the studies used the CS unplugged term when referring to &quot;paper-pencil activities,&quot; &quot;problem solving,&quot; &quot;storytelling,&quot; &quot;games,&quot; &quot;tangible programming,&quot; and even &quot;robotics.&quot;",

    "description": "This study was conducted in the context of a college course involving students enrolled in the university's teacher-preparation program. In an effort to facilitate in-class activities and promote student satisfaction, the instructor developed web-based agendas for students to access via their laptop computers. The research spans two semesters in which the interactive agendas were provided for all class sessions. The agendas were posted in the learning management system and were actively used by 60 students during class. They formed a gateway to various cloud-based materials including databases, Google documents, forms, and slides. Students used the daily agendas to engage in target content and collaborate with one another during class. Based on positive responses from participants and the observed productivity among students, findings suggest interactive agendas may be a viable alternative to hardware/devices, software, and policy-based attempts to control or limit student technology use in the 1:1 classroom.",

    "description": "The emergence of 21st-century skills convinced educational institutions in modifying teaching styles, which lead to the introduction of blended, flipped, and personalized learning. Studies demonstrated present-day best practices, but none provided a practical assessment procedure. Thus, this study aimed to develop a tool in evaluating learning modules--the 21st-century e-Learning Module Assessment Tool. Identification of components for the instrument revealed the interrelating nature of blended, flipped, and personalized learning; hence, it considered nine components of 21st-century teaching instead of assessing the teaching styles separately. Content validity is established through expert evaluation while reliability is established through pilot testing. 21st-Century e-Learning Module Assessment Tool uses a 5-point scale to rate learning modules based on its compliance to the nine components of 21st-century teaching. The developed assessment tool is recommended to be used as standard in evaluating existing learning modules and a guide for future 21st-century learning modules.",

    "description": "Students displaying reading difficulties/disabilities at the end of third grade are unlikely to succeed in content areas and graduate from high school. One alternative to meeting the learning needs of students is to provide explicit instructional support in basic literacy skills through computer-based reading programs via after-school programs. This study examined the effects of two computer-based reading programs on the reading skills of 71 randomly assigned at-risk students using a pre-post-test design. Furthermore, tutor and students' perceptions regarding the effectiveness and desirability of the programs were examined. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the programs on the Word Use Fluency measure and both computer-based programs were effective in facilitating the growth of basic early literacy skills of students at-risk for reading failure.

    "description": "The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has traumatized the entire world. COVID-19 has prompted experts to rethink the suitable pedagogies of teaching--learning that will prove to be sustainable with the global health crises going on. Blended learning is one of the models proposed by various educationalists and research scholars that appears to be a viable and best-fit solution for educational institutes for at least a period of a few months postpandemic. This study investigates the readiness of in-service teachers considering them as learners toward blended learning and its six dimensions. The results indicated that there existed a correlation among the six dimensions of blended learning while considering the readiness of in-service teachers toward blended learning. In addition, the results indicated that both male and female teachers and teachers who have and have not attended/conducted webinars/lectures/Faculty Development Programs online have had no difference in their readiness toward blended learning.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of blended learning on students' academic achievement, to study teachers' perception of working in the unconventional blended atmosphere, and finally to infer on its potential in underprivileged elementary classrooms. Since this study was conducted in an unconventional set up with researchers acted as agents of change, design-based research methods were used with 50 children from a fifth standard class in an Indian elementary school. These methods included gathering and analyzing data in two cycles--preblended implantation stage and postblended stage. A mixed-method approach was followed for data collection. Quantitative data were collected through an achievement test and qualitative data were gathered from interviews with the teachers. Findings revealed that there were significant differences in achievement level between the two cycles, in favor of the postblended implantation stage, and this difference was found gender-neutral. Interviews with three teachers were also conducted to collect information about their experiences of introducing and implementing blended learning in their classrooms. The study concludes that blended learning ambiance increases students' academic achievement levels in elementary classrooms when teachers were supported with necessary policies and proficiencies. Overall, the time spent in blended learning had a positive effect on children's achievement irrespective of gender and these effects emerged during 10 weeks even in a school with poor technological infrastructure and underprepared yet willing teachers.",

    "description": "Technology has influenced every aspect of our living, and education is not an exception. During the current pandemic period of COVID-19, the latent motive of maintaining social distancing is leading to be one of the prime reasons for the students to get enrolled in online courses. Although the benefits of e-learning have been discussed in various previous studies, it is important to understand the quality of e-learning and the satisfaction level of learners during this forceful shift toward e-learning amid the pandemic of COVID-19. This research proposes a conceptual model for understanding the variables influencing e-learning quality (ELQ) and learner satisfaction under the moderating effect of maintaining social distancing. The model is empirically validated by means of the partial least square approach through structural equation modeling based on 435 responses of university students in India. The results suggest that assurance, reliability, responsiveness, and website content are the factors that influence the ELQ of the online courses during the pandemic. ELQ also strongly influences the learner's satisfaction. Interestingly, perceived benefits of maintaining social distancing have a significant negative moderating effect only between empathy and ELQ, which leads to the satisfaction of the learners.",

    "description": "With online learning solutions responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic, it is important for educational technologists and other practitioners to understand how learners are experiencing the demands of socially distanced online learning and how they conceive of themselves within distant spaces and digital communities. Research into the metacognitions of learners provides a non-technocratic focal point through which such information can be extracted. Framing learner self-beliefs as a form of metacognitive knowledge, the current article presents a virtual-reality-assisted thematic analysis into the self-appraisals of 210 socially distanced online learners at a Japanese university. The study focuses on the discursive rationalizations expressed in service of the academic self-concept. Four themes were identified in the data: formal assessment, affect and emotion, self-regulation, and transformative awareness. Such research provides educators with a platform for pedagogical intervention and course design considerations relative to the challenges of the online learning experience.",

Theoretically, the community of inquiry model was taken as a reference and the effectiveness of the instruction process was evaluated accordingly. Students were preservice teachers studying Computer Education and Information Technology in the third grade in the Van region in Turkey. There were a total of 19 students, of which 12 are male and seven are female. FC process was carried out in the spring semester of 2018-2019 and lasted 11 weeks in total. A mixed-method design was used to gathering the data. Therefore, the research design was an explanatory design from mixed-methods designs. The quantitative data collection tool was the Turkish version of the Community of Inquiry Survey. The quantitative data were analyzed by dividing the students into very low, low, high, and very high levels. The qualitative data collection tool was the interview form created concerning the community of inquiry model. The qualitative data were analyzed by the use of the community of inquiry coding template's themes. At the end of the instruction process, students had a very high level of cognitive, social, and teaching presence perception. This situation was detailed and supported with the qualitative data obtained. Concerning the cognitive presence, the students firstly talked about that they started the learning process with videos. Regarding the social presence, they mentioned the motivating effect of the questions. About the teaching presence, participants firstly mentioned the direct instruction role of the videos.",

According to their mental images on Instagram, we found four categories: &quot;communication and interaction,&quot; &quot;knowledge acquisition,&quot; &quot;entertainment and sharing,&quot; and &quot;negative effects of Instagram.&quot; In addition to their positive perceptions toward Instagram, the majority of adolescents focused on the negative effects such as addiction, mood disorders, narcissistic acts, and ethics violations. Based on the findings, we also suggested a theoretical model for educational use of Instagram and directions for future research.",

    "description": "Digital gamification has been argued to be a fun and enjoyable method to support Learning English as a Second Language (LESL) and to ease the gap between students' learning and educational practice. This systematic review presents an overview of the state of the art on the use of gamification for LESL in digital environments. Furthermore, this review study maps learning experiences of learners and their learning outcomes when they deal with LESL through gamification. For this systematic review, 22 publications dating from 2008 through 2019 were studied to highlight the foci of this field of research. Although, these studies reported positive effects of gamification on learners' learning experiences and their learning outcomes, none of the publications reported specific gamification elements associated to the learning experiences and outcomes. Being enjoyable, engaging, motivating and fun were positive learning experiences of gamified LESL environments. Content language learning, engagement, motivation, and satisfaction were targeted learning outcomes of gamified LESL. The results of this study provide suggestions on how to design digital gamification for students' LESL and their corresponding learning experiences and outcomes.",

    "author": "Tecedor, Marta, Perez, Alejandro",
    "description": "This manuscript contributes to the existing body of literature on learner training in computer-enhanced learning environments by examining how students conceptualize and experience their roles as learners in flipped Spanish courses and how these interpretations shape their behaviors and beliefs about learning under this new instructional approach. The goal of this study is to better understand learners' attitudes toward flipped instruction (FI) and use that knowledge to identify areas in the training that could be developed to more effectively prepare lower-level Spanish students for FI. Participants (n = 431) completed an online survey. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine the reliability of the instrument and a logistic regression was used to explore the variables associated with having a positive attitude toward FI. Our findings indicate that the main predictors of liking FIs are (i) being enrolled in an elementary course, (ii) having taken flipped courses in other subject areas, (iii) having a clear understanding of how the online platform works, and (iv) understanding the philosophy behind flipped courses. These results allow us to outline specific initiatives in the design of a learner training program for FI.",

    "description": "The tools and techniques of corpus linguistics have many uses in language pedagogy, most directly with language teachers and learners searching and using corpora themselves. This is often associated with work by Tim Johns who used the term Data-Driven Learning (DDL) back in 1990. This paper examines the growing body of empirical research in DDL over three decades (1989-2019), with rigorous trawls uncovering 489 separate publications, including 117 in internationally ranked journals, all divided into five time periods. Following a brief overview of previous syntheses, the study introduces our collection, outlining the coding procedures and conversion into a corpus of over 2.5 million words. The main part of the analysis focuses on the concluding sections of the papers to see what recommendations and future avenues of research are proposed in each time period. We use manual coding and semi-automated corpus keyword analysis to explore whether those points are in fact addressed in later publications as an indication of the evolution of the field.",

    "author": "Blazquez-Carretero, Miguel, Woore, Robert",
    "description": "Accurate spelling matters for L2 learners: It facilitates communication, affects other aspects of the writing process, and is an important assessment criterion. However, even in phonologically transparent writing systems like Spanish, L2 learners experience spelling difficulties. Nonetheless, explicit spelling instruction appears to be neglected by L2 teachers. Synchronous written corrective feedback, provided automatically by computerised spellcheckers, is one way of providing such instruction without cost to teaching time. However, evidence concerning the effectiveness of such feedback is mixed. Further, existing spellcheckers, designed for L1 speakers, present various problems for L2 learners. The current study reports on an experimental trial of a Pedagogic Spellchecker (PSC), developed specifically for L2 learners. In all, 107 adult learners of Spanish as a Foreign Language were block randomised into three treatment groups. All groups completed a short transcription task on five consecutive days. One group received feedback from the PSC; another received feedback from Microsoft Word spellchecker; the third received no feedback. Pre- and post-test data showed that the PSC group progressed significantly more in spelling accuracy than the other groups, with a large effect size. Nonetheless, Microsoft Word spellchecker reduced errors on spelling forms that it did not autocorrect. Pedagogical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "author": "Kent, David",
    "description": "Initial research, although limited, demonstrates promise for the use of a voice-user interface via a digital assistant (i.e., Google Assistant) for English language learners seeking language skill development. However, no research has sought to determine the adult English as a foreign language instructor response toward the application of such devices. This study addresses that gap by seeking to determine the pedagogical value of such an interactional modality by native-English speaking (NES) and non-native English speaking (NNES) instructors (n=12) enrolled in an MA(TESOL) program in Korea. Particular focus centers on the potential regarding the deployment of such a device with learners by these instructors, and their receptiveness toward using such a device from within their educational contexts. An exploratory qualitative method employing a semi-structured interview technique was undertaken. A concept driven coding approach in data analysis was then employed to develop a framework of pedagogical prospects regarding digital assistant use, built on aspects emerging from the concepts of comfortability, comprehension, usability, enjoyability, and worthwhileness. Results highlight that instructor perceptions regarding the potential use of voice-user interfaces in the classroom tend to align, although some minor differences did emerge, and that all are receptive to its use in a multitude of ways.",

Interactions were recorded using screen capture technology and complemented with semi-structured interviews. Identified patterns of interaction are presented by section (pre-, while, and post-listening); type of exercise (vocabulary activation, multiple-choice, dictation-cloze, sentence completion, and extension activity); and session (1 through 6). Reasons for help option use are mapped onto identified patterns and are tested for consistency. The findings inform an underlying set of guidelines for listening pedagogy.

    "description": "Eye tracking technology has become an increasingly popular methodology in language studies. Using data from 27 journals in language sciences indexed in the Social Science Citation Index and/or Scopus, we conducted an in-depth scientometric analysis of 341 research publications together with their 14,866 references between 1994 and 2018. We identified a number of countries, researchers, universities, and institutes with large numbers of publications in eye tracking research in language studies. We further discovered a mixed multitude of connected research trends that have shaped the nature and development of eye tracking research. Specifically, a document co-citation analysis revealed a number of major research clusters, their key topics, connections, and bursts (sudden citation surges). For example, the foci of clusters #0 through #5 were found to be perceptual learning, regressive eye movement(s), attributive adjective(s), stereotypical gender, discourse processing, and bilingual adult(s). The content of all the major clusters was closely examined and synthesized in the form of an in-depth review. Finally, we grounded the findings within a data-driven theory of scientific revolution and discussed how the observed patterns have contributed to the emergence of new trends. As the first scientometric investigation of eye tracking research in language studies, the present study offers several implications for future research that are discussed.",

I next review some key literature relating to the influence of the TESOL standards on teacher education and professional development. I then discuss a multi-year project, in which the TTST were first introduced into an existing CALL course and then integrated throughout the eight units of the course. I describe how the TTST as presented in the two TESOL publications--TESOL (2008) and Healey et al. (2011)--can provide a somewhat problematic set of expectations for the pre-service teacher candidates in that course. Input from participants led to a restructuring of the course and a reformulation of the Healey et al.'s (2011) &quot;can do&quot; statements to better serve those who have not yet begun their teaching career. I conclude with speculation about the value of the TTST in the present and near future, particularly in light of the recent expansion of online teaching brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "description": "The use of digital technology in the subject of Swedish as a second language (SSL) has increased in recent years. Schools in Sweden have received many newly arrived students due to the migration situation prevailing in contemporary European society. This article shares the findings of a study carried out on six SSL teachers' perceptions and experiences of using digital technology for SSL with newly arrived students. Participants' responses to interview questions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicated the following: participants negotiated the digital tools as an entry ticket for the newly arrived students to become engaged with the teaching, to support literacy development, and to aid communication. The findings also underscore the challenges that respondents struggled with in teaching using digital technology. Results suggest that although digital technology is a regular part of Swedish education, there is no clear research-based framework for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in SSL education or teacher education that teachers can rely on, meaning that it is up to teachers themselves to uncover relevant uses of digital technology to support SSL teaching.",

    "author": "Karatay, Yasin, Hegelheimer, Volker",
    "description": "The pandemic in 2020 has profoundly impacted millions of people all around the world. We have experienced intense disruption in our daily lives. We have lost loved ones, jobs, motivation, and precious time that could have been used more productively. The pandemic did not distinguish between borders, race, or gender. It affected everyone but not equally, unveiling socioeconomic differences within and across countries in access to robust health care, tolerable working environments, and other basic needs. Inevitably, the pandemic has also disrupted the normal course of the way we teach and learn, especially in English for Foreign Languages (EFL) contexts. Administrators and teachers needed to suddenly reconfigure their in-person classes for online teaching while students had to adjust to this new way of language learning. As Godwin-Jones (2020) envisaged, this widespread switch to distance learning seems likely to be the new normal rather than a one-time occurrence. Considering Hubbard and Levy's (2006) concern that &quot;both language teachers in training and practicing teachers will find themselves at a disadvantage if they are not adequately proficient in computer-assisted language learning,&quot; it is now even more crucial for language teachers to develop skills, knowledge, and understanding of technology use in language teaching. As Oskoz and Smith (2020) pointed out, this new era in language teaching and learning provides a unique opportunity to investigate the affordances of technology and harmonize these affordances with learner, teacher, and curricular objectives. Thus, taking a fresh look at teacher training for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in order to see how these affordances can be better implemented, especially in low-resource contexts, seems like a perfect place to start. In this article, we first discuss some critical issues in CALL teacher education. Then we introduce an online CALL teacher education (CTE) course by explaining how these issues have been implemented in designing the course. We conclude by providing practical guidelines on how to design online professional development courses in the language teaching field.",

    "author": "Liaw, Meei-Ling, Wu, Sumei",
    "description": "This study investigates the identities produced by three L2 teachers of different backgrounds and experiences in an intercultural telecollaborative project that integrated the use of mixed-reality technology. Content-analysis (Hoffman et al., 2011) and multimodal (inter)action analysis (Norris, 2011) were employed to identify the identity elements produced during their multimodal interactions. Using Darvin and Norton's (2015) model of investment (MOI) as an interpretative lens, this study uncovers the different identities held by the participants, and the ways in which they aspired to become good teachers. Findings also show that mixed-reality simulated teaching provided a safe environment for exercising professional agency, thereby facilitating identity development and promoting the sense of getting there. Interactive reflection provided a site of struggle where the value of capital and imagined identities shifted. Dialoguing among the participants allowed them to reassess the value of pre-acquired capital and move to (re)imagining new teacher identities and restructuring ideological structures. Mixed-reality teaching and intercultural professional learning sensitizes the less experienced teachers to the socially and culturally complex roles required for L2 teachers. The mixed-reality simulation technology still has its limitations, mainly where classroom interaction is concerned, because the number of avatar students is small and they cannot move around physically.",

Similarly, students experiencing immersive learning using virtual reality headsets can benefit from a playful and exploratory approach to language and culture learning (Arnold, 1979), which includes the opportunity to experiment and create content using accessible, code-free, and easy-to-adopt media and &quot;Maker&quot; techniques. This article proposes that this kind of content creation projects for students can result in an increased understanding and appreciation of the affordances of immersive technologies, especially when applied to cultural learning and second language acquisition. In these projects, students produce outcomes by learning to work together, use tools, develop skills, and reflect on their place within the work, as artist-makers, as language learners, and as creators of culture. Learners are encouraged to reflect on their process of Making, and in doing so broaden that reflection to encompass ideas around culture and language, the essence of their creative process coming from conceptual inquiry as much as from the practical Making. We propose ways to adopt immersive technologies and use a dedicated Maker and creator space to facilitate effective innovative language and culture pedagogy--one that might better support learning through creative exploration.",

This article proposes a pedagogy to incorporate Maker-Centered Learning (MCL), the framework that emerged from a Harvard Graduate School of Education research project, Agency by Design (AbD) in 2012, into language courses. Through the lens of the three indicators (&quot;looking closely,&quot; &quot;exploring complexity,&quot; and &quot;finding opportunity&quot;) and related descriptors put forward by the AbD project, the analysis of the two language courses--one French and the other Spanish--as case studies reveals how, despite differences in course objectives and design, they achieved similar results by (1) facilitating learner autonomy, (2) developing learner communities, and (3) fostering learning on a continuum by going beyond the classroom. We demonstrate that creative projects made possible through digital tools can generate opportunities for engaging with language, literature, and culture in ways that transform students into collaborators and creators of knowledge. This approach consequently displaces the MCL framework from its more traditional association with Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) fields, and bolsters the claims of scholars who view the arts and humanities as equally fertile ground for its application. The pedagogical methodology detailed here could be replicated in any language classroom.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effectiveness of two technology-enhanced models of the flipped classroom, discussion-oriented and role-reversal, on English language learners' expository writing skills and evaluated the proposed models as a means of teaching/learning writing skills. To these ends, a quasi-experimental design with three intact classes, one control (non-flipped group with 17 EFL learners) and two experimental (discussion-oriented group with 19 and role-reversal group with 24 EFL learners), was adopted. Pre and posttest essays were used to see the effectiveness of the two models, which used two digital apps. In addition, a researcher-made questionnaire and a semi-structured interview were utilized to evaluate the models with regard to writing skills. An analysis of covariance uncovered that the discussion-oriented and role-reversal flipped classrooms were more effective than the non-flipped ones. Also, the role-reversal group outperformed the discussion-oriented group in the writing gains in the posttest expository essays. Subsequent analyses demonstrated the positive perceptions and experiences about the flipped classrooms, revealing four themes of teacher support, personal feeling, peer support, and activities within and outside the classroom. This paper concludes with a call for technology integration in writing courses and more investigation into this promising technology-based pedagogy across different language skills.",

The limitations common in traditional face-to-face classrooms have brought researchers in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) to recognize that technology can provide environments to expose language learners to a larger variety of sociopragmatic situations and contexts to test and develop their L2 pragmatic competence. This article presents a historical overview of the tools and digital spaces that have been explored for the teaching and the research of L2 pragmatics. Pedagogical practices that have evolved from presentational to more interactive are then briefly discussed.

We used our analyses to generate profiles for elementary, middle, and high school teachers and draw comparisons across these profiles in our discussion. In particular, high school teachers reported the lowest perception of technology's value and the most infrequent use of technology integration strategies even though they reported their students used technology more frequently. Elementary teachers reported the most frequent use of technology integration strategies and the lowest satisfaction with the access and support they receive. This study supports the need for more research to adequately explore the role of school levels as these differences could provide important insights.",

    "description": "This study reports on a corpus analysis of samples of spoken discourse between a group of British and Taiwanese adolescents, with the aim of exploring the statistically significant differences in the use of grammatical categories between the two groups of participants. The key word method extended to a part-of-speech level using the web-based corpus analytical tool, &quot;Wmatrix,&quot; highlights those linguistic domains which deserve particular attention. Specifically, it reveals the lexical and grammatical categories that occur unusually frequently or unusually infrequently in the English learners' discourse when compared with the language used by the native speakers of English in the sample. The research findings delineate the pedagogical merit of key domain analysis and thus help to inform English as a foreign language teachers and materials developers in the design of courses emphasising spoken interaction.",

    "author": "Reinders, Hayo, Wattana, Sorada",
    "description": "The possible benefits of digital games for language learning and teaching have received increasing interest in recent years. Games are said, amongst others, to be motivating, to lower affective barriers in learning, and to encourage foreign or second language (L2) interaction. But how do learners actually experience the use of games? What impact does gameplay have on students' perceptions of themselves as learners, and how does this affect their learning practice? These questions are important as they are likely to influence the success of digital gamebased language learning, and as a result the way teachers might integrate games into the curriculum. In this study we investigated the experiences of five students who had participated in a fifteen-week game-based learning program at a university in Thailand. We conducted six interviews with each of them (for a total of 30 interviews) to identify what impact gameplay had in particular on their willingness to communicate in English (MacIntyre, D\u00f6rnyei, Cl\u00e9ment &amp; Noels, 1998). The results showed that gameplay had a number of benefits for the participants in this study, in particular in terms of lowering their affective barriers to learning and increasing their willingness to communicate. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of further research and classroom practice.",

    "description": "This paper reports on the impact of computer-mediated input, output and feedback on the development of second language (L2) word recognition from speech (WRS). A quasi-experimental pre-test/treatment/post-test research design was used involving three intact tertiary level English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. Classes were either assigned to a control group (n = 31) or to one of two alternative treatment levels which used a web-based computer application enabling self-determined opportunities to repeatedly listen to and reconstruct spoken target text into its written form. Treatment group one (n = 30) received text feedback after each of their efforts at target text reconstruction, whereas treatment group two (n = 35) did not. Results indicated that word recognition gain scores of those who used the application, regardless of treatment level, were significantly higher than those of the control group. The relationship between the quantity of self-determined exposure to input and word recognition improvements was moderate but not linear, with those choosing moderate levels of speech input deriving the greatest measurable improvement. Neither increased levels of modified output nor the provision of text feedback were associated with significant improvements in word recognition gain scores. Implications for computer-mediated approaches for the development of L2 WRS are described and areas for future empirical research are suggested.",

We statistically analyzed the actual utterances of speakers to find combinations of acoustic and linguistic features with high correlation between the scores estimated by the system and native English teachers. Our results showed that the best combination of acoustic features produced correlation coefficients of 0.929 and 0.753 for pronunciation and intelligibility scores, respectively, using open data for speakers at the 10-sentence level. In an offline test, we evaluated possibly-confusing pairs of phonemes that are often mispronounced by Japanese speakers of English. In addition, we developed an online real-time score estimation system for Japanese learners of English using offline techniques to evaluate the pronunciation and intelligibility scores in real-time with almost the same ability as English teachers. Finally, we show that both the objective and subjective evaluations improved after learning with our system.",

    "author": "Shen, Huizhong, Yuan, Yifeng, Ewing, Robyn",
    "description": "English language learning (ELL) websites and digital resources have been recognized as an important source of linguistic and cultural knowledge for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners to explore. The up-to-date information carried by authentic materials is invaluable for learners to develop an understanding of the target language/culture. However, there appears to be a gap between what the designer intends and what the user wants. This paper investigates Chinese university EFL teachers' perceptions of online English language websites and resources. The study focuses on a number of components of major language areas and skills in ELL websites, website materials, language users' preferences, and website usability. A total of 1519 English academics from 139 universities across China completed the online survey, and 164 of them voluntarily participated in focus group interviews anonymously. The empirical evidence of this study has highlighted that a pedagogically-oriented ELL website, targeting audiences with a variety of language proficiencies, was much liked by the Chinese EFL teachers. A preference was observed to see more current authentic language, examination-oriented English learning materials and tasks, and Eastern/non-Anglophone topics in the websites. In addition, it is found that website usability is another key factor that would impact ELL website popularity. A well-designed ELL website can effectively assist Chinese EFL learners to enhance their language competence and achieve optimal learning outcomes. This study provides a context-specific empirical base for innovative web-based EFL learning and teaching as well as website design and materials development in China. The proposed key features of a preferred ELL website may help better inform website designers, content writers and evaluators in their ELL website design/evaluation.",

    "description": "Website analysis is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that focuses on both digital literacy and language competence (Brugger, 2009). Website analysis in an EFL learning context has the potential to facilitate logical thinking and in the process develop functional language proficiency. This study reported on an English language website (http://www.travelbelize.org/) analysis experiment carried out for three weeks as an in-class and homework activity in a third year (junior) level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) course at a Japanese technical university. The purpose was to explore EFL learners' ability to analyze an English language website and produce concrete design responses in English. During the first week of the analysis (involving sixteen students selected due to performing the best during earlier in-class website analysis activities on the course), participants produced their own responses to eight open-ended design questions about the website. The second week of the analysis (involving all 59 students on the course) tested the students' ability to search for information from the website, and recorded their impressions about the website design based on standard usability questionnaires (&quot;CSUQ,&quot; &quot;QUIS,&quot; and &quot;MPRC&quot;). The third week of the analysis had the 59 students self-report on their use of meta-cognitive reading strategies (&quot;MARSI 1.0 Questionnaire&quot;) during the website analysis. The results of the questionnaires showed that, overall, the EFL students had a basic understanding of major design questions related to information organization, screen interface design, audience, technology used, etc. However, there was statistically significant variability between responses in different groups (comprehensive evaluation, webpage design, terminology and website information and website capabilities) and the respondents were not unanimous in their impressions about the website. The result of the student self-reports on metacognitive reading strategies showed wide acceptability and use of problem-solving strategies.",

    "description": "The aim of this study was to provide adaptive assistance to improve the listening comprehension of eleventh grade students. This study developed a video-based language learning system for handheld devices, using three levels of caption filtering adapted to student needs. Elementary level captioning excluded 220 English sight words (see Section 1 for definition), but provided captions and Chinese translations for the remaining words. Intermediate level excluded 1000 high frequency English words, but provided captions for the remaining words, and 2200 high frequency English words were excluded at the high intermediate caption filtering level. The result was that the viewers were provided with captions for words that were likely to be unfamiliar to them. Participants in the experimental group were assigned bilingual caption modes according to their pre-test results, while those in the control group were assigned standard caption modes. Our results indicate that students in the experimental group preferred adaptive captions, enjoyed the exercises more, and gained greater intrinsic motivation compared to those in the control group. The results confirm that different students require different quantities of information to balance listening comprehension and indicate that the proposed adaptive caption filtering approach may be an effective way to improve the skills required for listening proficiency.",

    "description": "This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of &quot;usability&quot; and &quot;functionality,&quot; these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n = 587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel &amp; Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students' comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.",

    "author": "Fredriksson, Christine",
    "description": "Synchronous written chat and instant messaging are tools which have been used and explored in online language learning settings for at least two decades. Research literature has shown that such tools give second language (L2) learners opportunities for language learning, e.g. , the interaction in real time with peers and native speakers, the written mode of language, and the time available for planning and monitoring utterances. However, since the majority of the empirical work on chat and instant messaging has been conducted under experimental conditions, relatively little research has investigated how interaction in chat influences language learning opportunities under the conditions of an online academic language course where students have unequal status because of their different language background and level of L2 proficiency. This article presents an explorative study of the interaction in chat in a web-based academic language course between students with different L1s and different levels of L2. The aim is to shed light on how student interaction in an institutional context benefits the language learning environment in a manner that promotes L2 learners' attention to linguistic items in their input and output, and that allow opportunities for functional practising. Based on a mainly quantitative analysis, this article illustrates how L2 learners' participation, the complexity of their utterances, and their opportunities for self-correction and corrective feedback are influenced by group formation.",

    "author": "Kissau, Scott, Algozzine, Bob",
    "description": "Research has called into question the suitability of fully-online instruction for certain teacher preparation courses. Methodology coursework, in particular, has been singled out in research as ill-suited to online instruction. Recent research, for example, involving second language (L2) teacher candidates has demonstrated that aspiring teachers who completed online methodology instruction were less confident in their abilities to teach L2 learners than their counterparts who completed the same instruction in a face-to-face (F2F) setting. To address the limitations of online instruction, while still incorporating its associated strengths, the development and implementation of hybridized methodology coursework have been proposed. Following this recommendation, the researchers developed and implemented hybridized L2 methodology courses that mirrored their pre-existing online and F2F equivalents. Using a mixed methodology, the researchers then conducted a three-way comparison of instructional delivery modes (online, F2F, hybrid) to investigate their impact on L2 teacher candidate self-efficacy. Although the results demonstrated that all three modes of instruction can be equally effective at increasing candidate confidence, they also highlighted the potential of hybridized instruction to address the limitations of online and F2F instruction, while still including their strengths. The findings also emphasized that simply viewing or participating in live demonstrations of teaching strategies in post-secondary methodology courses is not sufficient. To feel confident in their teaching abilities, teacher candidates need opportunities in their coursework to apply what they have learned in K-12 classrooms. Offering numerous research-based suggestions to improve the design of hybridized methodology courses, the study also serves to inform the development of future hybridized methodology coursework.",

    "description": "Despite the hundreds of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) publications over the past twenty years, statistically reliable measures of learning outcomes are few and far between. In part, this is due to the fact that well over half of all MALL-related studies report no objectively quantifiable learning outcomes, either because they did not involve MALL implementation projects, or if they did, learning gains were only based on subjective teacher assessments and/or student self-evaluations. Even more so, the paucity of statistically reliable learning outcome data stems from the short duration of projects and small numbers of students involved. Of the 291 distinct studies examined in this review only 35 meet minimal conditions of duration and sample size, i.e., ten experimental subjects over a period of at least a month. Sixteen of these suffer from serious design shortcomings, leaving only nineteen MALL studies that can reliably serve as a basis for determining the learning outcomes of mobile-based language applications. Of these studies, fifteen can be considered to report unequivocal positive results, with those focusing on reading, listening and speaking without exception evidencing a MALL application advantage. Four studies, all focusing on vocabulary, reported no significant differences.",

    "description": "The article reports on a mixed-methods study evaluating the use of a three-dimensional digital game-based language learning (3D-DGBLL) environment to teach German two-way prepositions and specialized vocabulary within a simulated real-world context of German recycling and waste management systems. The study assumed that goal-directed player activity in this environment would configure digital narratives, which in turn would help study participants in the experimental group to co-configure story maps for ordering and making sense of the problem spaces encountered in the environment. The study further assumed that these participants would subsequently rely on the story maps to help them structure written L2 narratives describing an imagined personal experience closely resembling the gameplay of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study found that immersion in the 3D-DGBLL environment influenced the manner in which the second language was invoked in these written narratives: Participants in the experimental group produced narratives containing more textual indicators describing the activity associated with the recycling and waste management systems and the spaces in which these systems are located. Increased usage of these indicators suggest that participants in the experimental group did indeed rely on story maps generated during 3D gameplay to structure their narratives, although stylistic and grammatical features of the narratives suggest, however, that changes could be made to the curricular implementation of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study also puts forward ideas for instructional best practices based on research findings and suggests future areas of development and investigation.",

The aim of this paper is to examine various technologies such as online chat, discussion forums and blogs, in terms of their suitability and affordances as reflective media. It begins by examining positional survey data gathered from student teachers (STs) who have used these social media over a period of time. Following this it focuses on one of the desired outcomes of Reflective Practice (RP), the construction of teacher identity as part of the process of becoming a professional. The construction of identity through the mediational tool of language used across these modes is examined through a corpus linguistics lens. Collections of language produced around RP activities are analysed as a corpus in quantitative and qualitative ways. These complementary sources of data in a mixed-methods approach provide some insights into the technologies and their potential in a Language Teacher Education (LTE) context. To this end, our findings suggest that blogs, in particular, foster narration, RP and the expression of identities, while chat and forums promote emotional and affective engagement, all of which can be useful to STs at the initial and continuing stages of their career.",

    "author": "Lin, Huifen",
    "description": "The ever growing interest in the development of foreign or second (L2) oral proficiency in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) classroom has resulted in a large body of studies looking at both the direct and indirect effects of CMC interventions on the acquisition of oral competences. The present study employed a quantitative meta-analytic approach to investigate such effects by synthesizing (quasi)experimental studies that provide empirical quantitative data for effect size calculation. A literature search located 25 relevant studies for the final analysis. Each study was independently coded for learner, design and publication characteristics. The averaged effect size was estimated from the included studies. The results of the meta-analysis reveal that communication mediated by computer/technologies produced a moderate positive effect on L2 learners' oral proficiency compared to face-to-face (F2F) communication or no interaction. Furthermore, CMC has roughly similar effect on pronunciation, lexical and syntactic level of oral production; however, it might have a negative impact on fluency and accuracy. This meta-analysis also found that the effect of CMC on oral proficiency depends on several methodological factors such as task type, outcome measurement, treatment length, and assessment task. Major findings of the current meta-analysis include: (1) studies relying on elicited data are superior to those utilizing naturalistic data; (2) reading aloud seems to be the task that could elicit the best oral performance from students; (3) surprisingly, CMC appeared to be harmful for accuracy and fluency; (4) studies that employed decision-making generated the largest effect size, followed by studies that used more than one task type; (5) among the four tasks, jigsaw actually generated a negative effect on oral performance; and (6) as the most popular task employed by primary researchers, opinion-exchange studies produced the smallest effect size. These findings need to be interpreted as exploratory rather than confirmatory since each of them became less trustworthy after taking into consideration numerous other factors such as CMC task and the particular CMC tool used, etc. Future research suggestions are provided and the limitations of this meta-analysis are addressed.",

    "author": "Strobl, Carola",
    "description": "This exploratory study sheds new light on students' perceptions of online feedback types for a complex writing task, summary writing from spoken input in a foreign language (L2), and investigates how these correlate with their actual learning to write. Students tend to favour clear-cut, instructivist rather than constructivist feedback, and guided self-evaluation through model solutions in online learning environments. However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress. This dichotomy was found to originate in a mismatch between their expectations towards the online learning module and the characteristics of the constructivist feedback conveyed. This mismatch can be attributed to three key factors: (1) evaluation, (2) linguistic focus, and (3) learner motivation.",

    "author": "Daskalovska, Nina",
    "description": "One of the aspects of knowing a word is the knowledge of which words it is usually used with. Since knowledge of collocations is essential for appropriate and fluent use of language, learning collocations should have a central place in the study of vocabulary. There are different opinions about the best ways of learning collocations. This study investigates the effectiveness of corpus-based activities for learning verb-adverb collocations compared to traditional activities usually found in course books. The test results show that the participants who learned the collocations with the help of the online concordancer gained more knowledge and had better results in all parts of the test.",

    "author": "Sun, Yu-Chih, Yang, Fang-Ying",
    "description": "The present study integrates service learning into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) speaking class using Web 2.0 tools--YouTube and Facebook--as platforms. Fourteen undergraduate students participated in the study. The purpose of the service-learning project was to link service learning with oral communication training in an EFL speaking class by having each student create two YouTube videos in which they made informative presentations about the university (e.g., transportation system) and the city (e.g., sightseeing spots) in English to international students on campus. A Facebook community was established as a forum for students to share their videos with the international students and peers. The results suggest that the project enhanced EFL students' public speaking-related skills (e.g., idea and content development, and pronunciation), built their confidence in speaking English, and allowed them to develop their own learning process and strategies. Moreover, Web 2.0 tools endow service learning with new possibilities of reaching a greater number of the target audience and provide the members of the community with alternative means of communication.",

    "description": "This study presents the results from a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system of Runyakitara (RU_CALL). The major objective was to provide an electronic language learning environment that can enable learners with mother tongue deficiencies to enhance their knowledge of grammar and acquire writing skills in Runyakitara. The system currently focuses on nouns and employs natural language processing in order to generate a large base of exercise material without extensive tuning by teachers. Language learners used the system over 10 sessions and their improvements were charted. Besides this empirical evaluation, we also sought the opinions of Runyakitara experts about the system (as a judgmental evaluation). Results from the evaluation study indicate that RU_CALL has the ability to assess users' knowledge of Runyakitara and to enhance grammar and writing skills in the language. This computational resource can be utilized by other interested learners of Runyakitara, and the idea can be extended to other indigenous languages with emigrant populations who wish to maintain their language skills.",

The instrument is used in a one-computer classroom where students were taught in a foreign language and had little access to books. It consists of video clips featuring images, sound and text intended to facilitate learning and retention of technical vocabulary in a first-year electricity course. The construction takes theories of social constructivism and learning with multimedia as its point of departure. In response to the need for knowledge of scientific vocabulary, the researcher collaborated with a group of 82 students and their two teachers to select and encode 81 video clips of technical terminology. The gains from the process of constructing the instrument enabled collaborative and interdisciplinary learning and showed the potential to facilitate technical vocabulary acquisition.",

The participants first evaluated researcher-generated prototypes, designed prototypes for two language proficiencies (beginner and upper intermediate) and iterated designs on both paper and screen. Analysis of the reworked prototypes resulted in five features of help option design: type, location, sequence, click-through, and display. Analyses of the interaction data showed that consensually the participants favored help options that are easy to use, promote learner control, support guidance, and stimulate learning.",

    "description": "Speaking practice is important for learners of a second language. Computer assisted language learning (CALL) systems can provide attractive opportunities for speaking practice when combined with automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. In this paper, we present a CALL system that offers spoken practice of word order, an important aspect of Dutch grammar. The system uses ASR technology to process the learner's responses and to detect errors so that immediate corrective feedback (CF) can be provided on learner errors. We evaluate the system as a learning environment by analyzing proficiency gains in pre- and post-tests, the logs of the practice sessions, and the learners' appreciation of the system. In this paper, we present two learning conditions: (1) the learners received oral practice and immediate CF on spoken performance and (2) learners received oral practice and NO CF on spoken performance. We found that our system was successful in providing L2 speaking practice. Results show that both groups improve their proficiency on the target feature as a result of treatment. Between the groups there is no significant difference in learning, but the groups proceeded differently through the sessions, and the learners in the group that received automatic CF evaluated the system more positively than the NO CF group. We discuss the performance of the system as an environment for language learning and the obtained proficiency test results, and relate them to current views on second language acquisition.",

    "description": "This study designed and developed a Chinese character handwriting diagnosis and remedial instruction (CHDRI) system to improve Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) learners' ability to write Chinese characters. The CFL learners were given two tests based on the CHDRI system. One test focused on Chinese character handwriting to diagnose the CFL learners' errors in the stroke order and their knowledge of Chinese characters, while the other test focused on the spatial structure of Chinese characters. Sixty-five participants, who had a strong desire to learn Chinese characters, voluntarily participated in this study. The results revealed that the CHDRI system enhanced the CFL learners' ability to write Chinese characters and to understand the spatial structure of Chinese characters, especially Sinosphere CFL learners. Moreover, it was found that remedial instruction materials not only reduced the amount of time the teacher spent coaching CFL learners in Chinese language learning but also facilitated the teacher's ability to provide feedback to individual learners.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the possible impacts of flipping the classroom on English language learners' academic performance, learning attitudes, and participation levels. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, three different formats for flip teaching were developed in this study. The results indicate that the structured and semi-structured flip lessons were more effective instructional designs than the non-flip lessons. With a varying extent, both the structured and semi-structured flip lessons helped the students attain better learning outcomes, develop better attitudes toward their learning experiences, and devote more effort in the learning process. Given the positive results, this paper concludes with a call for more research into this promising pedagogy to contribute to its knowledge base across disciplines.",

The effectiveness is compared based on the results obtained from the post-test and the delayed post-test, which is conducted five weeks later. The participants instructed by using both computer-based and teacher-driven grammar instruction supported by computer-based materials score higher than those who receive traditional instruction. Moreover, supporting teacher-driven instruction with computer-based materials in learning adverbial clauses can lead to higher achievement through taking practice beyond the classroom.",

    "description": "This exploratory computer assisted-language learning (CALL) study used a computer-mediated communication (CMC) interface to allow English as a foreign language (EFL) writing students in classes at two universities to give each other anonymous peer feedback about essay-writing assignments reacting to selected news stories. Experts also provided feedback review. Follow-up questions were facilitated by the interface. The students felt that they benefitted from the instructional design, but found that the peer review focused most on things like grammar whereas the experts focused on organization and structure, making the expert feedback more valuable. Researchers found that more complex issues discussed in the source news articles resulted in lower outcome scores, based on a rubric, than did source material simpler issues. The study also compared performance of students with higher and lower ability and evaluated the quality of the review comments. Conclusions and recommendations for practice are provided. This study is significant because it used CALL/CMC technology to provide online interactivity between students and reviewers in an open forum that allowed students to seek follow-up clarification to the comments of reviewers. The review process, therefore, was not a one-way anonymous communication from reviewer to student but rather allowed interactive discussion of the points and suggestions made by the reviewers.",

It analyses survey data in various manners, offering insight into teachers' awareness of the OILE phenomenon amongst students, the perceived or imagined effects of these practices on their students' English and the ways they do or do not integrate these cognitions into their own teaching. Results indicate that many professors are aware of the types of input that their learners may be exposed to, but that they know little of the specifics and few make use of this knowledge in their English courses. In the discussion some questions are raised as to future forms for English language teaching to specialists of other disciplines.",

It also surveys the learners' attitudes towards the role of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to examine the effects of the treatments given over 10 sessions on L2 collocations in the receptive and productive tasks. Results demonstrated that the three groups of participants who received the treatment tasks in the context of concordancing under symmetrical, asymmetrical, and no-scaffolding conditions, improved their knowledge of collocations significantly both in the receptive and productive tasks compared to the control group which had no access to concordancing and did not receive scaffolding. However, there was no significant difference among the performances of the concordancing groups either in the receptive or in the productive tasks. Moreover, learners expressed positive attitudes towards both concordancing and scaffolding.",

Using avatars, learners walk the virtual streets of London under the guidance of a native English-speaking instructor, and interact with each other using text and voice chat functions. The study examines the effects of this virtual environment on culture learning. Specifically, a qualitative case study combined with a time-series design is used to investigate the virtual context's impact on culture learning in terms of learner knowledge and attitudes, and to track associated change processes across the three research phases (baseline, treatment, and maintenance). The results show that all four English learners involved in the study benefitted from their cultural immersion, to varying extents, in the virtual environment. Four contributing learner factors, namely linguistic proficiency, motivation, character traits, and attitudes were found to correspond to the learners' levels of acquaintance with the target culture.",

In the search for ways to augment an EFL curriculum in which speaking practice is limited but the demand for improving oral proficiencies is high, this study explored the use of voice blogging to develop communication skills, analyzed the stages of students' blogging efforts, and investigated students' perceptions of this authentic language experience. Seventy-four intermediate EFL learners from two Freshman English classes at a national university in Taiwan participated in this study. During the semester-long experiment, students read online materials and used an instructional blogging site constructed by the teacher-researcher to post voice blog entries and comment on peers' blog posts. The recursive four stages of their blogging efforts were: reading to learn, planning and organizing, speaking, and sharing. In a post-task survey and in semi-structured interviews, students said they felt that the process of producing voice blog entries facilitated language learning, enhanced knowledge construction, and promoted social networking. Students also offered suggestions for ways to improve the project, such as teaching more online search skills, providing better online recording mechanisms, and setting up a combination of face-to-face and online interactions. This study's findings and suggestions for future voice blogging projects can serve as a template for integrating voice blogging into the EFL curriculum.",

In this study, the language learners' output performance (the quantity of IUs was operationalized as the dependent variable) was hypothesized to be affected by task type and duration time. The findings indicate that both were significant in eliciting the amount of IUs. As a result, the contributions of this study include (a) shedding some light on the academic and educational capacity of blog-mediated telecollaboration, (b) revealing multiple factors that might affect the telecollaborative mechanism with the use of weblogs for language learning purposes, and finally (c) evaluating interactive blogging activities' educational value for complementing formal-writing training.",

The study detected significant differences between word recognition scores measured before and after participants used the application. The manner with which students engaged with the computer application in terms of word recognition, self-determined exposure to speech input (repetitions) and modified output productivity (revisions) are also described and analysed. Differences in engagement by learners with different word recognition capabilities are noted. The paper concludes with a discussion of some recommendations for the use of computer-assisted development of L2 word recognition from speech and also provides concrete suggestions for much needed further empirical research in this area.",

Courseware implementation was combined with a sustained-content language teaching (SCLT) approach and a task-based learning (TBL) approach was adopted. The course mainly focused on vocabulary, listening, and reading comprehension. Evaluation of implementing these information and communication technologies (ICTs) in ESP instruction was based upon data from a variety of pre-tests and post-tests including cloze, dictation, essay writing, and Q&amp;A tests. The courseware not only provided learning materials for the target ESP, but also offered content-based and linguistic learning activities with corresponding instant self-evaluation. These features offered by the courseware both corresponded to the duel focus of the SCLT approach, and provided a model for developing an ESP courseware. Also, a teacher-centered instruction of the same subject matter was conducted with a control group. Students self-studying with the ESP courseware made as much progress as those that elected teacher-centered instruction. Most students were satisfied with the courseware-implemented ESP instruction combined with the SCLT and TBL approaches.",

However, EFL learners have difficulty in making paraphrases to meet their writing demands, and there has been little research on developing automatic reference tools to assist these learners' paraphrasing skills for better writing quality. In this study, we developed PREFER, an online corpus-based paraphrasing assistance system. Allowing multi-word input and returning promptly with a list of paraphrases in English and Chinese, along with usage patterns and example sentences, &quot;PREFER&quot; provides substantial support for EFL learners to vary their expressions during writing. An assessment study of the effectiveness of &quot;PREFER&quot; was conducted with 55 Chinese-speaking EFL college freshmen in an Asian country. The results indicated that &quot;PREFER&quot; offered the most benefits to students' writing performance (with an after-use improvement of 38.2%), compared with an online dictionary and an online thesaurus (-31.6% and -6.2%, respectively). Further investigation revealed that the less proficient, more motivated, and more conservative students showed more significant progress in the paraphrasing task with the help of &quot;PREFER.&quot; In the meantime, nearly 90% of the students expressed satisfaction with the paraphrases generated by &quot;PREFER,&quot; and its functions, and another 75% of them acknowledged that &quot;PREFER&quot; benefits their writing task.",

To date, however, there is still limited understanding of how EFL writers may make use of such tools along with dictionaries when engaging in a writing task. To better understand the question, this study investigated a class of non-English-major college students (N = 14) over a semester. Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning. This study provides empirical data that help to better understand how corpus tools contribute to EFL writing.",

    "description": "Focusing on the topic of the development of the plurilingual and intercultural competence through the integration of electronic communicative practices both in foreign language classrooms and non-formal contexts, this work aims at defining and characterizing, in view of a co-actional perspective, a &quot;pedagogical blog&quot;, by considering it from three different axes: a personal and social dimension, a collaborative and co-actional dimension and the management of linguistic and cultural repertoires dimension. In order to do so, this contribution presents and describes a case study which will highlight how blogs can be used in order to develop plurilingual and intercultural competences: we will present the classroom dynamics developed by the blog &quot;Falar pelos cotovelos&quot;, a year-long project created within the scope of the teaching and learning of Portuguese as a foreign language, in a non-formal setting (non-scholar public). Throughout the discussion of this purposeful sampling, our analysis will allow us to consider pedagogical blogs as means of socialization, as instruments at the service of exolingual interaction and as time-spaces for languages and cultures.",

    "author": "Tseng, Sheng-Shiang, Yeh, Hui-Chin, Yang, Shih-hsien",
    "description": "Previous studies have evaluated reading comprehension as the general understanding of reading texts. However, this broad and generic assessment of reading comprehension overlooks the specific aspects and processes that students need to develop. This study adopted Kintsch's Construction-Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels. EFL teachers can guide students to use online annotations to different extents in order to deepen their reading comprehension.",

    "author": "Yeh, Hui-Chin",
    "description": "Few studies have investigated how metacognitive processes foster the application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. This is largely due to its internal and unobservable characteristics. To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness. The system's functions overcame the limitations of observing students' metacognitive processes described in previous studies, and enabled teachers to provide follow-up instruction. Implications and recommendations are also addressed.",

This study takes preliminary steps toward that cause, examining the effectiveness of a badging system across two web-based university courses in relation to the individual differences of the learners. Individual differences are examined through the lens of Long-Dziuban reactive behavior types and traits. Results revealed differences in badge effectiveness that were dependent upon students' Long-Dziuban categorization. Student engagement, intrinsic motivation, reflective and integrative learning, and higher order learning were the constructs most dependent upon categorization.

With learner attitudes in mind, we developed online modules for beginning Korean and Japanese courses. In this article, we report the survey results and the process of developing these innovative blended and online modalities of content delivery, focusing on the strengths of the modules and the unforeseen development challenges. The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-/copresence are explored. We suggest that transforming conventional East Asian language courses into blended/online modes is not only feasible but also beneficial for foreign language teaching and learning.",

The five hypotheses were tested from the research design type mixed-method. The results related to our initial hypotheses show that the use of functionalities of an IWB and a digital teaching book depend on teaching disciplines. Thus, history-geography teachers and those in languages frequently use simple features of an IWB. Teachers in science and mathematics perceive and use the affordances in a more complex level of an IWB, which means they add items to the device to enrich the list of functions.",

    "description": "A growing number of studies examining second language (L2) teacher education from the perspective of sociocultural theory, in particular the activity theory framework (Engestr\u00f6m, 1999), show that transformations in teachers' cognition and practice can be fostered through negotiation of sociocultural and cognitive dissonance in their teaching environments. This case study examines 16 years of cognitive development of two Japanese language teachers practicing computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and the challenges they experienced as a result of the evolution of information and communications technology (ICT). The focus is on the challenges faced by L2 teachers and their responses, and how these challenges relate to the development of teachers' agency as CALL practitioners. Narrative inquiry data for both participants were collected following the Trajectory Equifinality Approach (e.g., Valsiner &amp; Sato, 2006), in which each teacher's life trajectory is visualized to identify critical points based on social affordances and constraints. The critical points were further analyzed and interpreted within and between activity systems. The data suggests that the teachers became aware of the social nature of the technology through the challenges they encountered when coordinating their own and students' mismatched values attached to ICT. Such a change in perceptions not only impacted their pedagogical usage of the technology but in turn also constituted their agency.",

An important aspect of teacher learning about the use of technology is the ability to identify the affordances of new tools and how they can support learning in the language classroom (Hampel &amp; Stickler, 2005; Kessler, 2010). This fourteen-month-long longitudinal study of the learning of two experienced foreign language teachers working together describes how their perceptions of the affordances of two computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools developed over time. Interview data collected over three semesters demonstrated how teachers' perceptions of affordance evolve through classroom practice with technology, and how such perceptions might be transferred to the use of a new tool. As well, although the two teachers used the same tools (blogs and wikis) in the same courses and, at times, with the same classes, they perceived different learning affordances in relation to the language learning processes they prioritized. The article will conclude with suggestions for ways in which a better understanding of affordance in teacher knowledge development has implications for the support of in-service language teachers' learning.",

Yet traditional approaches to technology continue to persist in many contexts. Although the role of teachers in this problem has been acknowledged, little is known about how teachers' everyday digital literacy practices influence teaching with technologies. Informed by Literacy Studies, the paper reports the findings from a larger qualitative study and explores the relationship between technology use in personal and professional domains of three language teachers. The study found that the participants' digital mindsets, comprising assumptions about affordances of digital technologies, shaped the ways in which the participants used digital technologies within and beyond classrooms. New literacies required creative and elaborated assumptions about affordances; however, these understandings had different significance for the participants. The article explains why teaching new literacies continues to be challenging and suggests implications for teachers' professional learning and education and language pedagogy.",

One of the essential CMC activities in foreign language education is undoubtedly telecollaboration. This is the application of online communication tools to connect classes of language learners in geographically distant locations with the aim of developing their foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative tasks and project work (O'Dowd, 2007). This paper begins by presenting a model of competences for the telecollaborative teacher, which has been developed and verified by this author (2013) using the Delphi technique. The paper then presents UNICollaboration (www.unicollaboration.eu), an online platform, which has been developed reflecting these competences and a sociocultural approach to teacher education. Following that, the findings of four qualitative case studies of novice telecollaborators are used to inform the design of tools and training courses for educators in this complex activity of online foreign language education.",

This study employs a situated learning approach to teacher training and explores what online teaching skills emerge in the process of collaborative situated learning, how these skills develop, and whether collaborative situated learning is an effective method of training instructors to teach in 3D VWs. Six English as a second language (ESL) teacher trainees enrolled in the Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language (TES/FL) program participated in the study. During the preteaching stage, teacher trainees developed language tasks to implement during the teaching stage with eight EFL students in 3D VWs. Blackboard wikis used for designing tasks allowed for observing the acquisition of five 3D-specific, integrated skills. The analysis of teaching sessions recorded through screen capturing software Camtasia Relay in conjunction with the teacher trainees' wikis and journals demonstrates that for this group of teachers, a situated learning approach was an effective method of teacher training.",

    "description": "This paper describes two studies that examined the awareness of pre-service English teachers regarding issues of digital literacy, fair use of digital materials, and e-safety. The participants in Study One designed reading and listening lessons utilizing online materials and then evaluated their lessons in terms of digital literacy and fair use. The participants in Study Two designed writing lessons based on social network services or online environments and evaluated the resulting lessons in terms of e-safety. This article reports on how these activities influenced selection criteria for online materials, methods for gathering instructional materials, and lesson plans. The results indicated that, initially, the pre-service teachers rarely considered these issues when selecting materials or designing class activities. The findings also showed that the participants' awareness of critical, ethical, and safe use of information and communication technologies was raised through activities for evaluating and discussing the selection of instructional materials and the lesson activities associated with them. Implications for teacher education in computer-assisted language learning are discussed.",

    "title": "Rethinking Transfer: Learning from CALL Teacher Education as Consequential Transition",
    "author": "Chao, Chin-chi",
    "description": "Behind CALL teacher education (CTE) there is an unproblematized consensus of transfer, which suggests a positivist and tool-centered view of learning gains that differs from the sociocultural focus of recent teacher education research. Drawing on Beach's (2003) conceptualization of transfer as &quot;consequential transition,&quot; this qualitative study seeks a cross-contextual understanding of language teacher learning with digital technology as the teachers in this study moved from a CTE course back to their own teaching contexts. Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching. These results challenge the view that transfer in CTE must be about using technology. It is suggested that a focus on critical reflection of technology use may encourage teachers to continue reflective engagement in the ever-changing and complicated digital learning and teaching context.",

    "title": "The Practices and Challenges of Telecollaboration in Higher Education in Europe",
    "author": "Helm, Francesca",
    "description": "Telecollaboration is an area of CALL research and practice which has developed considerably in the last twenty years. Many research studies have been carried out and important findings have been made, but there has not yet been a large scale survey to try and &quot;map&quot; the state of the art in telecollaboration practice. Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to how to meet these challenges and how telecollaboration practice could become mainstreamed in higher education.",

    "description": "This paper reports on a task-based language teaching course in Second Life. The data set consists of transcribed recordings and a teacher interview. Focusing on how the teacher facilitated student participation, this paper aims to explore the discourse functions in the teacher language output and then to address the teacher roles in three different task phases. All the turns produced by the teacher and the students were counted, the teacher language output in the recordings was classified into 19 discourse function categories, and then all the discourse functions were classified into six teacher roles. The results show that the during-task phase was student output oriented. This study reveals that in the pre-task phase the teacher used the largest number of types and tokens of discourse functions, and played a significant technical and social role. In the during-task phase, the teacher focused on motivating students to participate, monitoring student activities, and providing task support. In the post-task phase, the teacher was a language guide. While the teacher roles that were most prominent varied in the three task phases, the teacher was found to play four roles consistently in the three task phases: monitor role, motivator role, language guide role, and social role.",

    "description": "Language teachers are working in a world which has changed in the past decades in fundamentally disruptive ways, through profound changes in the role that networked computers play in everyday life and through the social and demographic shifts brought on by an increasingly globalized society, bringing together more than ever before people from different cultures and languages in real and virtual environments. One of the byproducts of this new environment is the growth in opportunity for language learning, in particular through informal environments such as social networks and networked gaming. The challenges for training language teachers to deal with this dynamic are considerable. They will need to be able to follow new developments in technology and be able to understand their potential use in second language instruction. In this column, Robert Godwin-Jones, examines the interconnected roles that L2 (second language) teachers may need to play in order to be effective in a changing social, educational, and technological environment.",

    "description": "The present article deals with the issue of how to create and operate a customizable on-line concordancer from viewpoints of language teachers and with their own laptops. It aims to introduce how to use and manage this application without relying on computer engineers for various pedagogical purposes, focusing on the four beneficial dimensions of its interface and technical features: accessibility, simplicity, functionality, and manageability. In addition, the carefully written directions illustrate how to implement this open-source application on laptops using pre-established or customized corpora. For those in the field of language teaching and learning, this application is designed to allow teachers to operate different types or levels of corpora in separate spaces on one server and to enable multiple simultaneous connections in classroom contexts. Ultimately, the authors believe that this application will not only allow students to actively experience data-driven learning anywhere and anytime, but also will help teachers manage their own version of this online concordancer by autonomously uploading any kinds of source texts for corpus analysis at their pedagogical discretion.",

    "author": "Arnold, Nike, Ducate, Lara",
    "description": "While teachers play a central role in capitalizing on the potentials of computer assisted language learning (CALL), CALL teacher education overall still appears not to be adequate and effective (Healey et al., 2011; Hubbard, 2008). Furthermore, foreign/second language teachers have expressed a desire for more and better professional development opportunities in that area (Beaven, Emke, Ernest, Germain-Rutherford, Hampel, Hopkins, Stanojevic &amp; Stickler, 2010; Digedu, 2014; Kessler, 2006). Given the continuing and new challenges for CALL teacher education, this special issue of &quot;Language Learning &amp; Technology&quot; on CALL teacher education further speaks to its importance for our field and ultimately our students. To advance our understanding of CALL teacher education, the main goal for this issue is to move beyond research on teacher beliefs and attitudes to investigate actual practices and competencies, especially from a longitudinal perspective, that traces teachers&apos; development. The current issue brings together a collection of articles that represents a wide variety of contexts, formats, foci, and research methods. This variety is particularly important given the highly contextualized nature of teaching and learning (Freeman &amp; Johnson, 1998) and the different needs of pre-service and in-service teachers (Beaven et al., 2010).",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "In today's globalized, connected world, fixed and stable identities are increasingly uncommon. The means and modes of online communication and engagement, themselves powerful contributors to identity formation, are likewise in a constant state of flux. Participating in emerging online communities may require users to develop new skills, acquire specific software or hardware, and/or learn particular conventions and behavior norms. In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities. Capability in a full range of digital literacies is key to that process and vital today in education, personal life, and work environments: The growing importance of online technologies for the ways in which we work and learn in global networks has meant that today, instead of using technology simply to learn FLs [foreign languages], learners need to learn how to combine both FL skills and &quot;e-skills&quot; or &quot;new literacies&quot; to be able to work and collaborate in new contexts where the borders between the visual and the real and between the distant and the proximate are increasingly blurred (Dooly &amp; O'Dowd, 2012, p. 15). That blurring of boundaries among literacies, genres, and modes of representation is what makes this topic intriguing and challenging.",

This model is framed within Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK, Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) and advocates a learning-by-doing approach (Chapelle &amp; Hegelheimer, 2004) to understand how English teachers develop CALL competency and adopt the competency in their teaching. Participants were 24 elementary English teachers in Taiwan. The study used a mixed methods design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007), collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data concurrently but separately before they were triangulated. Findings show that the TPACK-in-Action workshops had a positive impact on the 24 teachers. In addition to the development of CALL competency, it was also observed that participants demonstrated CALL competency in their teaching, such as selecting online materials and appropriate technology for content teaching, using cloud computing for student interaction, and matching the affordances of technology to meet their instructional goals and pedagogy. In sum, the study provides empirical evidence and a new perspective in the investigation of CALL teacher education. The theoretical and pedagogical implications for CALL teacher education research and practice are discussed.",

    "author": "Kissau, Scott",
    "description": "Research conducted over the past decade has consistently reported no significant differences in learning outcomes for students of fully online or face-to-face (F2F) instruction. Only a small number of these studies, however, have focused on courses in second language (L2) teacher preparation programs. Even fewer studies have compared the impact of online and F2F instruction on classroom practice. To fill this void in the research, an investigation was conducted of the impact of method of instructional delivery on the performance of teacher candidates in a Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) program during their culminating student teaching internship. Focusing on a group of TESL interns who completed either online or F2F methodology training, a mixed methodology was used to compare student teacher outcomes on two key performance assessments and to compare university supervisor perceptions of student teacher performance. While the type of instructional setting was not found to significantly impact the teaching performance of the interns, interview data suggested that support from a cooperating teacher and prior experience working with students of diverse language and cultural backgrounds strongly influenced the teacher candidates' instructional practices.",

By taking advantage of the communications revolution that is currently reshaping the world, internationally aligned investigators can foster new knowledge, technology, and practices that develop improved teaching strategies and policies appropriate to our rapidly changing times. Beginning with a brief overview of the impact that technology has had on education and post-2000 nascent research areas related to DSCLT, this article goes on to examine whether or not the impact of research is geographically bound, and if so, how transnational alliances can be useful in bridging gaps in the continuum of knowledge-building. Finally, the potential gains that could stem from an enhanced collaboration between international research communities are examined, although admittedly such endeavors are not without challenges.",

    "author": "Wallace, Lara",
    "description": "Research in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has frequently taken a top-down approach when investigating learners' attitudes and behavior, both in the course as well as for their personal use. Suggestions are given for use of technology, and future research (Beatty, 2010; Levy &amp; Stockwell, 2006). One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data. The findings revealed valuable insights through the eyes of the learners regarding what technology the learners found to be helpful and/or obstructive, both in the course as well as for their personal use, and suggestions for improvements in use of technology are given. Finally, future research directions in CALL using reflexive photography are discussed.",

The research methodology included the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to evaluate the course. The results of the survey showed that most students displayed positive learning outcomes, indicating that the instruction model could contribute to the effectiveness of learning English writing.

This study employs eyetracking technology to investigate ten learners' attention during synchronous online language learning in a multimodal environment. The participants were learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language at beginner's or lower-intermediate level. While learners took part in two different online activities, one focusing on reading, the other on interaction with others, their gaze focus was tracked, and in subsequent stimulated recall interviews the learners reflected on their engagement with the screen and their intentions while reading or speaking online. Our findings show that during reading tasks, when Pinyin transcriptions as well as Chinese characters were presented, all beginner and lower intermediate participants focused to some degree on the Pinyin. In the interactive task learners' gaze was drawn to elements of the screen that were not immediately necessary for technical or linguistic reasons but that could be interpreted as containing social presence information, e.g. names listed and emoticons employed by other users.",

The expansion of CA in Second Language Acquisition research, coupled with the need for qualitative techniques to explore how people interact in technology-mediated environments, has stimulated a small but growing body of research. This article reviews CALL research that employed a CA approach to the collection, microanalysis, and understanding of the data in a variety of technology-mediated fields (text, audio and video SCMC, email, forums and bulletin boards, social networks, and games), with participants from different contexts and languages, interacting in an L2 either among themselves or with native/more expert speakers of the language. Most research up to now has been descriptive in nature, illustrating the sequential organization of interaction, interactional and linguistic resources employed by the participants, and affordances and challenges of the media to promote language learning. In addition, a few studies have directly explored &quot;learning&quot; through the microanalysis of longitudinal data for any changes in the learners' linguistic and interactional patterns of engagement. The review of studies is followed by those challenges that affect the implementation of CA in CALL research and a vision of the future of CA for CALL in the larger field of Applied Linguistics.",

    "description": "Studies investigating the use of mobile technologies when other options are available are still relatively rare in the literature, with the majority of studies requiring that learners use a particular technology, either using their own devices or devices provided by the institution. One exception to this was a study by Stockwell (2010) that examined how learners in Japan perceived the use of mobile phones for language learning and how willing they were to engage in the activities. This study, however, was conducted prior to the spread of smart phones and it focused exclusively on learners in Japan. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to replicate this study, but differed in two ways. First, although it was run in essentially the same environment as the original study, in the current study the majority of learners owned smart phones. Second, the same system was used not only in Japan but also with learners studying at a university in Taiwan. Data were collected through server logs, post-treatment surveys and semi-structured interviews. The results are discussed in terms of the ways in which learners engaged in the activities on their mobile phones, and the effect of the mobile platform on the time taken to complete the activities over the course of the semester. These results were correlated with those from the original 2010 study to identify the potential effect of the smart phone.",

The findings showed that these sites have the potential to facilitate language learning. The learning tasks created using the social networking features of these sites are to provide examples of how to use these SNSLL as teaching tools under a socio-constructivist learning framework. In addition, the results of the usability testing highlighted the importance of considering the website's information, interface, and interaction designs. SNSLL should be as easy to use and as intuitive to navigate as possible. We hope the findings will provide valuable insights regarding how SNSLL can be used as teaching and learning tools, and how they should be designed to facilitate pedagogical goals.",

Levels of CT ability were elicited through episodes of L2 negotiation and co-construction of meaning. The study also examines the perception by students of the impact of the VLLE on the emergence of their L2 CT skills. Motivated by the need advocated in recent CALL research for a shift in paradigm and in method to alleviate the limitations inherent to quantitative studies, the study was situated at the juncture of sociocultural theory and ecological perspective, and this article focuses on the theoretical rationale behind the selection of a mixed-method methodology.",

    "author": "Garrett-Rucks, Paula, Howles, Les, Lake, William M.",
    "description": "This study extends current research about L2 hypermedia texts by investigating the combined use of audiovisual features including: (a) Contextualized images, (b) rollover translations, (c) cultural information, (d) audio explanations and (e) comprehension check exercises. Specifically, student perceptions of hypermedia readings compared to traditional print texts are investigated in this study to address theoretical concerns that the combined use of multiple audiovisual annotations might split learners' attention from their reading comprehension. Additionally, student perceptions of the usefulness of the annotation features afforded by the hypermedia texts were investigated. Data were collected from 70 French language learners across four intermediate and advanced French courses at a large Midwestern research university. Participants in each course were assigned hypermedia readings, each of which being paired with an analogous traditional print reading of the same genre, with a similar word count and reading difficulty level, followed by a format preference survey. Results from data analysis of the format preference surveys showed statistically significant differences for user preference of the hypermedia texts and a user belief that the hypermedia format facilitated reading comprehension with less effort than print readings. Research findings about the reported usefulness of the annotation features are situated within Mayer's (2005) cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Directions for future research into the optimal design of hypermedia texts are discussed.",

    "description": "This study investigates the acquisition of the L2 French vowel /y/ in a mobile-assisted learning environment, via the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Particularly, it addresses the question of whether ASR-based pronunciation instruction using a mobile device can improve the production and perception of French /y/. Forty-two elementary French students participated in an experimental study in which they were assigned to one of three groups: (1) the ASR Group, which used an ASR application on their mobile devices to complete weekly pronunciation activities, with immediate written visual (textual) feedback provided by the software and no human interaction; (2) the Non-ASR Group, which completed the same weekly pronunciation activities in individual weekly sessions but with a teacher who provided immediate oral feedback using recasts and repetitions; and finally, (3) the Control Group, which participated in weekly individual meetings 'to practice their conversation skills' with a teacher who provided no pronunciation feedback. The study followed a pretest/posttest design. According to the results of the dependent samples t-tests, only the ASR group improved significantly from pretest to posttest (p &lt; 0.001), and none of the groups improved in perception. The overall success of the ASR group on the production measures suggests that this type of learning environment is propitious for the development of segmental features such as /y/ in L2 French.",

    "description": "Social presence is considered an important quality in computer-mediated communication as it promotes willingness in learners to take risks through participation in interpersonal exchanges (Kehrwald, 2008) and makes communication more natural (Lowenthal, 2010). While social presence has mostly been investigated through questionnaire data and quantitative content analysis of online interactions based on a set of predefined indicators, in a smaller number of studies the concept has also been investigated through qualitative analysis of interviews (Kehrwald, 2008, 2010). Yet studies that bring together multiple sources of data collection and examine multimodal language learning contexts are almost non-existent. In this paper, the theory of social presence is employed to explicate language learners' online multimodal communication using a case study approach. Multiple sources of data were collected, including interviews, open-ended and closed post-task questionnaires, stimulated reflection and recordings of video interactions. The main findings of the study included an innovative social presence framework developed for the analysis of online multimodal language learner interactions (Satar, 2010), which can be used in further qualitative and exploratory research. It also has potential applicability for educators to develop strategies for language learners to guide them in creating and transmitting their social presence. The focus of this article is a cross-case analysis for one of the components of social presence, sustaining interaction, bringing together social presence theory, interactional sociolinguistics and multimodal interaction analysis. Finally, strategies are proposed for language learners on how to sustain their online multimodal interactions.",

    "description": "The article considers the role of qualitative research methods in CALL through describing a series of examples. These examples are used to highlight the importance and value of qualitative data in relation to a specific research objective in CALL. The use of qualitative methods in conjunction with other approaches as in mixed method research designs are a particular focus. It is argued that qualitative methods are especially effective when used in this way. The discussion also aims to elaborate upon the role of qualitative approaches within CALL specifically, as a domain for research study with particular attributes that require a qualitative orientation. Here the use of electronic dictionaries is considered. Dictionary use is suited to such a discussion because it occurs frequently in everyday life, suggesting a qualitative approach, as well as in research studies that are strictly controlled, as in a quantitative approach. The contrast is instructive and helps demonstrate the respective strengths and limitations of each method. Also central to the discussion is the language learner. A number of the studies described emphasize the importance of listening to the students' voice in the qualitative component (e.g., Conole, 2008; Jones, 2003). It is in the unpacking of what students actually do moment-by-moment in CALL tasks and activities that best illustrate the strengths of qualitative methods in enhancing our understanding of mediated learning and thereby driving productive research agendas.",

Using research processes inherent in Grounded Theory, data was collected from a criterion sample of six experienced English-as-a-second-language players of World of Warcraft. Data included semi-structured interviews, observations, elicited email texts and extant texts. Data was transcribed, coded, and refined through a cyclic process of constant comparative analysis until patterns emerged. The results revealed 15 vocabulary learning strategies, including noticing frequency of words, recognizing knowledge gaps, selecting words for attention, equating images and actions to words, giving and receiving explanations and feedback, observing players, using words to learn words, reading in-game information, and using Google. This taxonomy of 15 vocabulary learning strategies provides a framework for further research into vocabulary learning strategy taxonomies and autonomous learning in informal digital contexts.",

    "description": "Conceptual replication within a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) environment provides an understanding of the generalizability of second language acquisition (SLA) research (Porte, 2013; Smith &amp; Schulze, 2013). The present study replicates Collentine (1998a), a classroom-based experiment framed within a larger discussion on the relative benefits of input- and output-based instruction. Collentine (1998a) compared the benefits of Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 2004) and output-based instruction, both of which elevated the Spanish subjunctive's communicative value. The results showed that input- or output-oriented instruction informed by how learners process grammatical information can affect the acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena. This conceptual replication not only seeks to corroborate the original study's findings in a new learning context. It also tests the finding's generalizability to a tutorial CALL environment built on 3D simulations and emerging web-app technologies. The participants were foreign-language learners of Spanish in a classroom-based curriculum (N = 50). The results indicate that, in the classroom and in a CALL environment, both input- and output-oriented approaches can promote the acquisition of a complex grammatical structure if practice is meaningful (informed by psycholinguistic processing principles) and deliberate, and if feedback is provided.",

    "description": "Many college students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL) are less-proficient readers as they have few opportunities to negotiate their perspectives for creating meaning through peer questioning in onsite instruction. This study reports on using online peer questioning to enhance less-proficient college students' negotiation of meaning in comprehending texts. A sample of 50 college students was divided into two groups based on the pre-test, into a more-proficient group and a less-proficient group, with 25 students in each group. The results of this study reveal that the less-proficient students made greater progress in reading comprehension than the more-proficient students after using the strategy of online peer questioning. The less-proficient students were able to explicitly observe how the more-proficient peers used integration questions, agreed or disagreed with peer responses, and finally constructed new understandings of the hypertexts. Particularly, the less-proficient students learned from the more-proficient peers on how to engage in critical thinking to express and share multiple perspectives. Using online peer questioning, both the more-and the less-proficient students frequently engaged in negotiation of meaning, interaction, and teaching one another. Their reading progress was reflected in the post-test, the types of questions and responses, and their perceptions toward using online peer questioning.",

Both qualitative and quantitative data, including observation and English learning performances, were collected and analyzed. The positive results obtained from the study approved that the usage of virtual contexts in EFL learning could (1) provide students with learning opportunities without the time and space limits, (2) provide students with a game-liked scenario for English learning, and (3) enhance learners' EFL performances. The learning mode proposed and experiences gained in the current study not only serve as a practical reference to diverse foreign language educational occasions but also add to the knowledge pool of foreign language learning and teaching in virtual worlds.",

This study aims to go beyond this general observation through a case study that explores how discourse analysis tools might be used to uncover evidence of language and intercultural learning in comments on YouTube videos involving Chinese-English translanguaging. Analysis of exchange structure--interactional acts involving information exchange and stance marking--suggests that translanguaging triggers interactionally-rich comments that are oriented towards information exchange and negotiation for meaning on topics of language and culture. It is argued that the methodologies used have good potential for use in studies that aim to investigate learning in online settings, both at the environmental level, in macroanalysis of large data sets, and at the individual/situational level, in microanalysis of shorter interactional sequences.",

    "description": "This paper presents a case study of the multilingual writing practices of a Serbian university student on Facebook, examining how he uses multiple varieties of English and Serbian images and video to shape his online identity and establish membership in local and global communities. Drawing on data from stimulated-recall interviews, online participant observation, and rhetorical analysis, this study shows how Aleksandar, a hip-hop artist, appropriates hip-hop codes and employs the &quot;gate-keeping&quot; function of posting links (Baek, Holton, Harp, &amp; Yaschur, 2011) by embedding links to music videos in his own highly personal code-mixed text in order to establish himself as a distinctly Serbian member of the global hip-hop community. The findings suggest that Aleksandar's language practices and attitudes might be better understood as translingual (Canagarajah, 2011), as the student integrates diverse linguistic and semiotic resources into a unified expression of identity, relying on the multimodal affordances of digital writing to accomplish his communicative goals. However, these sophisticated textual practices go undervalued in his EFL writing courses, where formal, monolingual, non-digital literacy remains primary (Saxena, 2011). These findings suggest a need to re-evaluate what it means to have a second language-mediated identity, and to expand the focus of EFL writing pedagogy.",

In this paper, I give an overview of netnography and its applicability in studying online language teaching communities. Drawing upon a netnography of a globally-distributed online community of practice of English language teachers, Webheads in Action, I provide detailed accounts of my experiences during data collection and particular methodological considerations in netnography in order to shed light on the often untold aspects of an ethnographic design in online research that involves participant observation.

Nineteen intermediate and advanced learners of German were asked to outline the position of the German government regarding immigration. L2 readers received a selection of five Internet sources which varied in reliability and appropriateness for the research assignment. Students' reading behavior was recorded through think-aloud protocols. The findings only partially replicated Goldman et al. Better learners used significantly more varied reading strategies overall than poorer learners. Their reading behavior was marked by greater use of self-explanation and monitoring. Better learners also skipped more unfamiliar words. Nevertheless, neither group of L2 readers employed reading and research skills that lead to a coherent intertext model fulfilling the goal of the research task.",

In applying a conversation analysis approach, this study scrutinizes the precise nature of peer-to-peer advice giving and receiving. In this process, an advice giver can be viewed at certain moments as more competent to evaluate a recipient's essay and to provide advice, while the recipient can be positioned as being less knowledgeable. Therefore, the present study focuses on the following research question: How did advice givers and recipients manage the asymmetrical participant roles inherent in L2 peer response? More specifically, this study explores the relationship between institutional roles and social relationships during advising episodes by investigating three single cases of dyadic pairs in an ESL university writing classroom. We show the ambiguity arising in interactions as novice advice givers attempt to balance criticism with the maintenance of harmonious interpersonal relationships, offering compliments rather than straightforward advice.",

The software makes use of an eighty-million-word corpus of English known to be correct as a normative corpus for error correction purposes. It was discovered that bigrams (two-word combinations of words) present in a student's writing but which are not found, or which are suspiciously rare, in the normative corpus are likely to contain errors. The program highlights such bigrams in compositions, and guidance is provided to help students decide if they have indeed made a mistake, and if so, how to correct it. A cohort of students who volunteered to trial the software for a month reported positively on their experience; it had helped them find mistakes in their own and their peers' writing and had greatly accelerated the self-correction process.",

By extracting information on 21 features from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for instructional/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger groups or no grouping.

By analysing two English-language learners' multimodal ensembles, the study reports on how multimodality contributes to a critical perspective when engaging with media texts, and on the ways in which learners orchestrate multiple semiotic resources to demonstrate their analysis of the politics of representation and the resulting consequences. The findings reveal that, on the one hand, the students were able to identify the power relations between characters as well as how particular characters are marginalized in the media texts they viewed by paying attention to the multiple modes that make up the text's representation. On the other hand, the students were able to articulate the ideological subtexts they identified through the orchestration of various modes rather than relying on the linguistic mode, making their message as persuasive and effective as those in the media texts viewed.",

Consequently, this study investigated the factors underlying such discrepancies by exploring 33 EFL learners' experiences of participating in a blog project at a Taiwanese university. The students wrote personal blogs and responded to each other over a ten-week period. Data was collected through a questionnaire and individual interviews with 10 of the students. Drawing on a sociological approach, specialization codes of legitimation (Maton, 2007, 2014), the study found salient differences in the students' educational beliefs and practices, which appeared to be linked to their positive or negative blogging experiences. By analyzing the relations between the pedagogical design, learners' existing educational dispositions, and their blogging experiences, the study argued that the blog project assumed learners of a certain type--those who recognized themselves as &quot;knowers&quot; in terms of their blog content--while disadvantaging others who did not possess this attribute. Practitioners are therefore advised to exercise caution when designing blog activities.",

Adopting &quot;Second Language Socialization and Language Learning &amp; Identity&quot; approaches to language learning inquiry, it responds to an identified shortage of research on computer-mediated language socialization. Focus is placed on the development of participant identities as valid writers of English texts for a perceived mass public. As part of Wikipedia writing praxis, writers are socialized to varying degrees into the community of Wikipedia. This study focuses on Hong Kong university students' reported experiences as legitimate peripheral participants, looking at the early stages of potential community membership. Ethnographic observations serve to provide a description of both the classroom and the Wikipedia site as dynamic social settings. Data sources include field notes, participant-generated written reflections, and transcripts of focus group interviews. Through these various channels it becomes clear that perception of a potentially vast reading public wields a subtle but important influence. Experiences with the Wikipedia community also play a role, motivating some participants to think deeply about their writing and prompting them to invest in writer identities online and in their local context.",

    "author": "Garberoglio, Carrie Lou, Dickson, Duncan, Cawthon, Stephanie, Bond, Mark",
    "description": "Deaf individuals frequently capitalize upon communication technologies that increase equitable access to communication in an ongoing, effortless manner. Those communication technologies create conditions that increase direct access to language and literacy. It is the lack of direct access to language that has been historically problematic for deaf individuals, contributing to English literacy achievement gaps that are evidenced in deaf education settings. This study explored the hypothesis that increased access to English through communication technologies would be related to stronger English literacy skills for deaf individuals. A secondary analysis approach using a longitudinal large-scale dataset, the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), was used to assess the frequency of computer-mediated communication as a predictor of English literacy skills in a sample of 510 deaf youths in the United States. Regression analyses demonstrated that deaf adolescents who e-mailed or chatted more frequently exhibited higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These results suggest that communication technologies should be further explored as a potential avenue that may support deaf individuals' English language and literacy development.",

    "description": "Technology including social media and other technology applications enabled by different technology devices offer many possibilities for second language learners to improve their learning, if they are interested in doing so. We investigated purposes for using technology among urban adolescents, including both English language learners (ELLs) and native English speakers (NESs). Data were collected through a survey of 531 students in an urban public middle school in the USA. The results showed that students used technology for diverse purposes regardless of their first language background. Although overall technology students' access was comparable to national averages, the use of technology for many specific purposes was markedly lower, lending support to the notion of a new digital divide between students from high- and low-income families based on technology knowledge and meaningful application of such knowledge rather than mere access. Student reports of their own English skills were related to various specific uses of technology, e.g., blogging and email. These relationships were stronger for ELLs, particularly those in grade 6, than for NESs. The results suggest that younger ELL adolescents may be more aware of their language constraints and prone to use technology in certain ways than their NES peers. These findings provide some preliminary insights into the complex relationships between language skills and student preferences for technology use and can ultimately provide guidance for the integration of technology into language and literacy instruction for linguistically diverse urban adolescents.",

    "description": "This paper reports on a study of the interactions between text chat and audio modalities in L2 communication in a synthetic (virtual) world and observes whether the text chat modality was used for corrective feedback and the characteristics of the latter. This is examined within the context of a hybrid content and language integrated learning design workshop. This course involved 17 students of architecture whose L2 was either French or English and for which the synthetic world environment Second Life was employed for distance language sessions. Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, it was found that text chat was employed for content-based interaction concerning the task as well as for feedback concerning non-target-like errors in the audio modality. Feedback predominantly concerned lexical errors and was offered in the form of recasts. The multimodality of the environment did not appear to cognitively overload students who frequently responded in the audio modality to corrective feedback offered in the text chat. The study highlights the need to train language tutors who wish to exploit synthetic worlds to use the text chat in parallel with the audio to support learners' verbal production with respect to verbal participation and proficiency.",

Feedback was gradually reduced to promote independent production and monitoring. Both participants showed improvement in /r/ production in trained and untrained single words as indicated by percentage increases and effect sizes. Blind ratings by independent experts indicated significant /r/ production improvements during the reading of the Rainbow Passage. Perceptual distinction of /r/ and /l/ in minimal pairs also showed an upward trend. These findings suggest that spectrographic visual feedback is a promising method for training /r/ to Japanese-speaking English language learners.",

    "description": "This study investigated the quantity and characteristics of student language production, discourse functions, and morphosyntactic features in three different discourse settings--face-to-face (F2F), lab-setting chatroom interactions (Lab), and any place/any device chatroom interactions (APAD). Discourse was examined through the replication and extension of Richard Kern's (1995) study. Similarities in findings between the two studies included a continuation of incomplete, and short sentence lengths among F2F students, an absence of F2F greetings, and a higher rate of assertions, verb tenses, and simple sentences in the Lab setting. Differences included a higher rate of F2F turns in the current study, an absence of greetings in the lab setting, and a greater number of commands among F2F participants. Findings underscored what Kern previously asserted: that F2F and chatroom settings tend to encourage and support slightly different goals associated with language discourse. Kern stated that more sophisticated conversation occurred in the chatroom setting. Current findings concurred but furthered that more conversational interaction took place within the F2F discourse setting due to a greater number of commands, turns, and incomplete sentences. Similarly, F2F students experienced greater input due to the increase of words heard, questions asked, and commands made.",

However, empirical studies have generally not been able to produce conclusive evidence about their actual worth. In Frankenberg-Garcia (2012a), I argued that these studies--and indeed learners&apos; dictionaries themselves--do not distinguish sufficiently between examples meant to aid language comprehension and examples that focus on enhancing language production. The present study reports on an experiment with secondary school students carried out to test the usefulness of separate corpus examples for comprehension and production. The results support the need for different types of examples for comprehension and production, and provide evidence in support of data-driven learning, particularly if learners have access to more than one example.",

    "description": "Corpora have been suggested as valuable sources for teaching English for academic purposes (EAP). Since previous studies have mainly focused on corpus use in classroom settings, more research is needed to reveal how students react to using corpora on their own and what should be provided to help them become autonomous corpus users, considering that their ultimate goal is to be independent scholars and writers. In the present study, conducted in an engineering lab at a Korean university over 22 weeks, data on students' experiences and evaluations of consulting general and specialized corpora for academic writing were collected and analyzed. The findings show that, while both corpora served the participants well as reference sources, the specialized corpus was particularly valued for its direct help in academic writing because, as non-native English-speaking graduate engineering students, the participants wanted to follow the writing conventions of their discourse community. The participants also showed disparate attitudes toward the time taken for corpus consultation due to differences in factors such as academic experience, search purposes, and writing tasks. The article concludes with several suggestions for better corpus use with EAP students regarding the compilation of a corpus, corpus training, corpus competence, and academic writing.",

    "description": "For many EFL learners, listening poses a grave challenge. The difficulty in segmenting a stream of speech and limited capacity in short-term memory are common weaknesses for language learners. Specifically, reduced forms, which frequently appear in authentic informal conversations, compound the challenges in listening comprehension. Numerous interventions have been implemented to assist EFL language learners, and of these, the application of captions has been found highly effective in promoting learning. Few studies have examined how different modes of captions may enhance listening comprehension. This study proposes three modes of captions: full, keyword-only, and annotated keyword captions and investigates their contribution to the learning of reduced forms and overall listening comprehension. Forty-four EFL university students participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The results revealed that all three groups exhibited improvement on the pre-test while the annotated keyword caption group exhibited the best performance with the highest mean score. Comparing performances between groups, the annotated keyword caption group also emulated both the full caption and the keyword-only caption groups, particularly in the ability to recognize reduced forms. The study sheds light on the potential of annotated keyword captions in enhancing reduced forms learning and overall listening comprehension.",

    "description": "Corpus linguistics has established that language is highly patterned. The use of patterned language has been linked to processing advantages with respect to listening and reading, which has implications for perceptions of fluency. The last twenty years has seen an increase in the integration of corpus-based language learning, or data-driven learning (DDL), as a supporting feature in teaching English as a foreign/second language (EFL/ESL). Most research has investigated student attitudes towards DDL as a tool to facilitate writing. Other studies, though notably fewer, have taken a quantitative perspective of the efficacy of DDL as a tool to facilitate the inductive learning of grammar rules. The purpose of this study is three-fold: (1) to present an EFL curriculum designed around DDL with the aim of improving spoken fluency; (2) to gauge how effective students were in employing newly discovered phrases in an appropriate manner; and (3) to investigate student attitudes toward such an approach to language learning. Student attitudes were investigated via a questionnaire and then triangulated through interviews and student logs. The findings indicate that students believe DDL to be a useful and effective tool in the classroom. However, students do note some difficulties related to DDL, such as encountering unfamiliar vocabulary and cut-off concordance lines. Finally, questions are raised as to the students&apos; ability to embed learned phrases in a pragmatically appropriate way.",

    "description": "This paper investigates the usefulness of Web portals in a workbench for assisting student interpreters in the search for and collection of vocabulary. The experiment involved a class of fifteen English as a Foreign Language (EFL) student interpreters, who were required to equip themselves with the appropriate English vocabulary to handle an interpreting task they had been assigned. The subjects were given the same topic for vocabulary building in two stages--one stage without and the other stage with the use of the workbench. They were not allowed to repeat vocabulary items in the two stages. They documented their experience in vocabulary preparation in the first stage, and provided think-aloud protocols for the second stage. They also completed a questionnaire and submitted two portfolios. The vocabulary portfolios compiled during the two stages were then compared. The results indicate that, with the use of the workbench, the subjects were more efficient in performing the task of building vocabulary by searching for the required vocabulary, and were able to build a vocabulary portfolio that was larger in size and richer in variety. The data also reveal that most students make use of Web portals that have a specific focus, rather than general search engines. The findings provide important information to support the use of the workbench as a tool for training EFL student interpreters in vocabulary building, and also show that guided Web portals are essential for users who need to perform Web-based language learning activities to achieve efficient search results.",

In the study, 49 participants completed two weeks of ESL grammar instruction on the passive voice in English. The learners participated in one of three instructional treatments: a data-driven learning treatment, a deductive instructional treatment using corpus-informed teaching materials, and a deductive instructional treatment using traditional (i.e., non-corpus-informed) materials. Results from pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test indicated that the DDL group significantly improved their grammar ability with the passive voice, while the other two treatment groups did not show significant gains. The findings from this study suggest that in this learning context there are measurable benefits to teaching ESL grammar inductively using paper-based DDL.",

    "description": "This paper presents research findings of a longitudinal empirical case study that investigated an innovative Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) professional development program for pre-service English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers. The conceptualization of the program was based on the assumption that pre-service language teachers learn better in situated contexts (Egbert, 2006). Therefore, a key component of the program was the development of school-based research projects, in which the student teachers needed to design, implement, and evaluate technology-enhanced EFL lessons in collaboration with in-service teachers. Data were collected via field notes, video recordings of lessons, academic research reports produced by the pre-service teachers, and in-depth interviews with the pre-service and in-service teachers. Our findings indicate that the field experiences provided professional learning opportunities that supported the student teachers&apos; development as CALL practitioners. The participating pre-service teachers especially emphasized the important role played by school-based experiences in allowing them to use technology in authentic language teaching scenarios and to evaluate the impact of technology on language teaching and learning. The paper concludes with a discussion of important principles and guidelines that should underlie and inform such collaborative efforts and a summary of the implications of the findings for the design of CALL pre-service teacher education programs.",

    "description": "This paper presents findings from a study investigating young English language learners (YELLs) in Sweden in 4th grade (N = 76, aged 10-11). Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire and a one-week language diary. The main purpose was to examine the learners' L2 English language-related activities outside of school in general, and their use of computers and engagement in playing digital games in particular. A comparison is made between language-related activities in English, Swedish, and other languages. Another purpose was to see whether there is a relationship between playing digital games and (a) gender, (b) L1, (c) motivation for learning English, (d) self-assessed English ability, and (e) self-reported strategies for speaking English. In order to do so, the sample was divided into three digital game groups, (1) non-gamers, (2) moderate, and (3) frequent gamers (greater than or equal to 4 hours/week), based on diary data (using self-reported times for &quot;playing digital games&quot; in English). Results showed that YELLs are extensively involved in extramural English (EE) activities (M = 7.2 hrs/w). There are statistically significant gender differences, boys (11.5 hrs/w) and girls (5.1 hrs/w; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.01), the reason being boys' greater time investment in digital gaming and watching films. The girls, on the other hand, spent significantly more time on pastime language-related activities in Swedish (11.5 hrs/w) than the boys (8.0 hrs/w; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.05), the reason being girls' greater time investment in facebooking. Investigation of the digital game groups revealed that group (1) was predominantly female, (2) a mix, and (3) predominantly male. YELLs with an L1 other than Swedish were overrepresented in group (3). Motivation and self-assessed English ability were high across all groups. Finally, regarding the self-reported strategies, code-switching to one's L1 was more commonly reported by non- and moderate gamers than frequent gamers.",

    "description": "This study reports on the results of classroom research investigating the effects of corpus use in the process of revising compositions in English as a foreign language. Our primary aim was to investigate the relationship between the information extracted from corpus data and how that information actually helped in revising different types of errors in the essays. In &quot;data-driven learning,&quot; previous research has often failed to provide rigorous criteria for choosing the words or phrases suitable for correction with corpus data. By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy. This reveals that certain errors are more suitable for checking against corpus data than others.",

    "description": "Despite the spread of reliable technological tools and the availability of computers in Iranian universities, as well as the mounting evidence of the effectiveness of blended learning, many Iranian language teachers are still reluctant to incorporate such tools in their English as a foreign language (EFL) classes. This study inspected the status quo of technology integration in Iranian EFL classes and investigated the obstacles, as perceived by the Iranian EFL teachers, toward implementing CALL in Iran. First, 100 EFL teachers completed the Teacher Technology Integration Survey developed by Vannatta and Banister (2009), to help estimate technology use in EFL classes. Then the researchers interviewed twelve teachers, comprising two EFL teacher educators with no CALL experience, four teachers with the experience of integrating technology in their EFL classes, four EFL teachers who had recently finished an online CALL teacher education program, and two EFL teachers with no CALL experience. The semi-structured interview questions were designed by the researchers, one of whom has extensive experience with CALL, and were revised based on the suggestions of a colleague with expertise in teacher education. One of the researchers conducted the interviews, each of which lasted for 30-50 minutes. The researchers used structural content analysis of the interview transcripts to find themes relevant to the research question. The results suggest that on the whole, Iranian EFL teachers do not usually integrate digital technology into their classes; and the obstacles in implementing CALL in language classrooms could be classified into three categories: teacher, facility, and learner constraints. Each of the categories is discussed in detail and suggestions are provided for promoting CALL in the Iranian context.",

    "description": "While researchers have examined the effectiveness of various online gloss types on incidental L2 vocabulary learning, little research on online gloss languages has been conducted. Previous attempts which compared the effects of L1 and L2 glosses have reported mixed results. To fill the gaps, this study examined the effectiveness of Chinese and English e-glosses on incidental English vocabulary learning on a less-researched student group in CALL -- junior high-school English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students. Seventy-eight students with Chinese as their first language read two online passages with either Chinese (L1) or English (L2) glosses. They were divided into four treatment groups: (1) high-proficiency students receiving L1 gloss before L2 gloss (n = 19), (2) high-proficiency students receiving L2 gloss before L1 gloss (n = 19), (3) low-proficiency students receiving L1 gloss before L2 gloss (n = 20), and (4) low-proficiency students receiving L2 gloss before L1 gloss (n = 20). After reading, the students were assessed with a vocabulary test which contained a definition-supply part and a cloze part serving as both post-tests and delayed post-tests. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were utilized to analyze the score data. Significant differences were found not only among the four groups but also between the two post-tests. Overall the high proficiency groups performed better in the post-tests, but the high proficiency group who received English glosses remembered more words in the delayed post-test than the high proficiency group who received Chinese glosses. The results show that as learners&apos; proficiency increases, they may be able to make better use of the L2 conceptual links for word retention and learning. The conclusions support the usefulness of both Chinese and English e-glosses which should be selected based on learners&apos; proficiency level.",

    "description": "This paper examines whether and to what extent data-driven learning (DDL) activities can improve the lexico-grammatical use of abstract nouns in L2 writing. A topic-based corpus was compiled to develop concordance learning activities, and 40 Chinese students majoring in English were randomly assigned to a control group or an experimental group. At the prewriting stage, both groups were given a list of five abstract nouns: the experimental group was provided with paper-based concordance lines to study the collocations of the words, while the control group was allowed to consult dictionaries for the usage of the words. The written texts of the pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test were analysed and compared between and within groups. The results showed that the written output by the experimental group, as compared with the control group, contained a higher variety of collocational and colligational patterns and had fewer linguistic errors in using the target abstract nouns. The post-experiment learning journals and questionnaires administered to the experimental group further confirmed that concordance activities encouraged usage-based learning, helped students notice the lexical collocations and prepositional colligations of the target words, and thus improved accuracy and complexity in their productive language. Despite these positive findings, potential problems of using concordance activities for independent learning were also reflected in the students' written output and reported in the learning journals.",

    "description": "This paper reports a Spanish-American telecollaborative project through which students used &quot;Twitter,&quot; blogs and podcasts for intercultural exchange over the course of one semester. The paper outlines the methodology for the project including pedagogical objectives, task design, selection of web tools and implementation. Using qualitative and quantitative data collection, the study explored how the application of Web 2.0 facilitated cross-cultural communication. How the use of digital technology affected the way in which the students viewed intercultural learning and peer feedback was examined. The findings showed that students viewed the online exchange as a superb venue for intercultural communication with native speakers. Through social engagements, students not only gained cultural knowledge but also became more aware of their own beliefs and attitudes toward their own culture. In addition, discussions on topics of tangible and intangible cultures afforded the opportunity to raise students' awareness of cultural norms and practices. Peer feedback helped learners increase lexical knowledge, prevent language fossilization, and acquire native-sounding discourse. The study suggests that allocating sufficient time to complete each task and making personal commitment to online contributions are essential to successful intercultural exchanges.",

    "author": "Lenko-Szymanska, Agnieszka",
    "description": "The paper describes a teacher-training course on the use of corpora in language education offered to graduate students at the Institute of Applied Linguistics, University of Warsaw. It also presents the results of two questionnaires distributed to the students prior to and after the second edition of the course. The main aims of the course are: to introduce students to the concept of a corpus and its analysis; to familiarize them with a range of available corpora, corpus-based resources and tools; and to demonstrate to them various applications of corpora in language education, with special emphasis placed on the in-house preparation of courses, teaching materials and class activities. In the first part of the paper, the design, the syllabus, the progression and the outcomes of the course are outlined. In the second part, the responses of thirteen students who participated in the second edition of the course are analysed. The analysis indicates that on the whole the students reacted positively to the course and they saw the benefits of corpus-based materials and tools in language teaching. Yet the students also reported that they needed more time to gain full command of the resources and software presented and more guidance on the pedagogical issues related to corpus use. The paper concludes that fourteen sessions, designed as an overview of the whole range of corpus-based resources and applications, is not sufficient to encourage teacher trainees to use corpora in their future work if they have no contact with these resources and tools in other classes. Only extensive exposure to corpora by future teachers coupled with suitable teacher training in the applications of corpora in language education may bring a substantial change in the scope of corpus use in language classrooms in the wide educational context.",

    "description": "Learner corpora have become prominent in language teaching and learning, enhancing data-driven learning (DDL) pedagogy by promoting &quot;learning driven data&quot; in the classroom. This study explores the potential of a local learner corpus by investigating the effects of two types of DDL activities, one relying on a native-speaker corpus (NSC) and the second combining native-speaker and learner corpora. Both types of activities aimed at improving second language writers&apos; knowledge of linking adverbials and were based on a preliminary analysis of adverbial use in the local learner corpus produced by 31 study participants. Quantitative and qualitative data, obtained from writing samples, pre/post-tests, and questionnaires, were converged through concurrent triangulation. The results showed an increase in frequency, diversity and accuracy in all participants&apos; use of adverbials, but more significant improvement was made by the students who were exposed to the corpus containing their own writing. The findings of this study are thus interpreted as suggestive that combining learner and native-speaker data is a feasible and effective practice, which can be readily integrated in DDL-based instruction with positive impact.",

    "description": "This study aims to investigate barriers to the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) for teachers of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) in US universities. Although the development of ICT for teaching is growing, few published studies address ICT specifically regarding CFL teaching. Therefore, this study has reviewed the existing ICT literature's treatment of important ICT-related matters, including barrier factors, and has examined them in the context of CFL teaching. The current study features a mixed method, consisting of a survey and semi-structured interviews. Of the 47 CFL teachers who participated in the study, five volunteered for in-depth interviews. According to our findings, the most critical barriers to these CFL teachers' adoption of ICT were insufficient support and insufficient time for developing technology-driven pedagogy and activities. These issues are reflected in CFL teachers' unique subject expertise and workloads in existing universities' curricula and approaches to instruction. In addition, age influences CFL teachers' confidence in their use of ICT for the preparation of subject material and for teaching, whereas gender influences their willingness to spend time working on ICT.",

    "description": "The aim of this study was twofold: we investigated (a) the effect of two types of captioned video (i.e., on-screen text in the same language as the video) on listening comprehension; (b) L2 learners' perception of the usefulness of captions while watching L2 video. The participants, 226 university-level students from a Flemish university, watched three short French clips in one of three conditions: the control group watched the clips without captions (&quot;N&quot; = 70), the second group had fully captioned clips (&quot;N&quot; = 81), the third group had keyword captioned clips (&quot;N&quot; = 75). After each clip, all participants took a listening comprehension test, which consisted of global and detailed questions. To answer the detailed questions, participants had access to an audio passage of the corresponding clip. At the end of the experiment, participants completed a questionnaire and open-ended survey questions about their perception of captions. Our findings revealed that the full captioning group outperformed both the no captioning and the keyword captioning group on the global comprehension questions. However, no difference was found between the keyword captioning and the no captioning group. Results of the detailed comprehension questions (with audio) revealed no differences between the three conditions. A content-analysis approach to the questionnaire indicated that learners' perceived need for full captions is strong. Participants consider captions useful for speech decoding and meaning-making processes. Surprisingly, keyword captions were considered highly distracting. These findings suggest that full rather than keyword captioning should be considered when proposing video-based listening comprehension activities to L2 learners.",

Sixty-four participants (32 dyads) completed two jigsaw tasks in two different mediums (one in each) and four days after the tasks they were asked to identify the instances where they had communication breakdowns in a stimulated recall protocol. The findings of the study revealed that the average number of the NofM exchanges and durations of the tasks were higher in face to face mode (F2F) but the participants of the synchronous computer mediated communication (SCMC) group noticed a higher average of NofM instances (M = 10.72) compared to the F2F group (M = 9.13) and the difference was significant. Based on these results, we can argue that F2F promotes a better context for the production of NofM, but the SCMC environment leads to more instances of noticing.",

The study recruited 59 sixth-grade students from two separate EFL classes. A class of 28 students was identified as the experimental group, and another class of 31 students was assigned as the control group. The students of the experimental group carried mobile devices to carry out EFL writing assignments within specific and familiar subject environments, stimulating real-life situations or contexts. The results of the experiment indicated a significant difference in learning achievement between the two groups. Students in the experimental group perceived the designed activities to be fun; thus, they were more inclined to maintain interest in situated learning scenarios. Furthermore, based on interviews with participating students from both groups, we found that the activities presented within familiar contexts, and supported by our proposed EFL writing system, inspired students to not only write more sentences, but to describe the target objects clearly and thoroughly.",

Our results showed that both student populations had not used ICT much for language learning previously, that their ratings varied depending on use of ICT in their course and that students with an increased use of technology in their courses seemed to realize its true potential for productive skills, but also some of its disadvantages. The perceived usefulness of ICT for skills and different areas of language was also different. The students who had used ICT less in their course rated it as most useful for some areas of language (grammar and vocabulary) followed by receptive skills, and least useful for the development of pronunciation and productive skills. However, students who had used ICT more in their course rated it lower for its usefulness for areas of language and receptive skills, and rated it higher for the improvement of pronunciation and productive skills. This study encourages the use of ICT for language learning, showing that students had very positive perceptions of its usefulness, and recommends adding guides and training to blended learning experiences to diminish the number of students rejecting the use of ICT.",

    "author": "Beuls, Katrien",
    "description": "Construction grammar (CG) has been proposed as an adequate grammatical formalism for building intelligent language tutoring systems because it is highly compatible with the learning strategies observed in second language learning. Unfortunately, the lack of computational CG implementations has made it impossible in the past to corroborate these proposals with actual language tutoring prototypes. However, recent advances in Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) now offer exciting new ways of operationalizing robust and open-ended language processing within a CG approach. This paper demonstrates its adequacy for ICALL applications through a case study on error diagnosis in the domain of Spanish tense, aspect and modal morphology. The performance of the FCG tutor is tested on the Spanish Learner Language Oral Corpus (SPLOCC 2). This first FCG Spanish error diagnostic prototype achieves an accuracy of 70% on a total of 500 conjugation errors in four oral tasks carried out by 20 low intermediate and 20 advanced English learners of Spanish. Follow-up experiments will test this prototype on larger learner corpora of differing proficiency levels.",

Sixty-eight freshmen enrolled in an English course and received either traditional or morphological instruction for learning English vocabulary. The experimental part of the study was conducted over two-hour class periods for seven weeks. To investigate the effects of morphological instruction on English vocabulary learning, all participants completed an English vocabulary recognition task. Fixation time and path during recognition were recorded with an eye-tracking device. A comparison between the post-test performances of both groups showed that the experimental group obtained a considerably higher score on the target eye-tracking vocabulary test. The results of the eye-tracking record showed that participants who received morphological instruction had longer fixation times on the vocabulary and morpheme areas compared with the group that received traditional instruction. In addition, the experimental group had dense fixation paths on the morpheme areas of vocabulary. These results indicate that participants who received morphological instruction considered the morphemes as inferring references to read and inferred unknown words with greater success.",

    "description": "This paper discusses challenges and opportunities arising during the development of open educational resources (OERs) to support communicative language teaching (CLT) with interactive whiteboards (IWBs). iTILT (interactive Technologies in Language Teaching), a European Lifelong Learning Project, has two main aims: (a) to promote &quot;best practice&quot; or effective CLT teaching with IWBs, and (b) to support continuing professional development among language teachers both in formal training contexts and through informal independent study. Some 40 teachers in seven European countries, working with learners of six foreign languages at various educational and proficiency levels, were trained and followed over one school year in order to collect over 200 video examples of classroom practice. These short (3-minute) class videos were selected collaboratively by teachers and researchers, and supported by learner and teacher commentaries. The main outcome of the project is an open-access website (http://itilt.eu), a searchable repository of training materials (manual, sample materials) and classroom illustrations (video clips, participant comments). This study explores the action research dimension of successive phases of the project from the development of appropriate training materials, data collection in language classrooms, selection of illustrative teaching episodes, and preparation for online presentation for future teacher education. It investigates the influence of research-based training on teacher development and the inclusion of participant perspectives, and explores how this kind of OER can support open practices. The paper also raises issues with respect to &quot;best practice&quot; and user requirements. The paper concludes with &quot;lessons learned&quot; throughout the project, showing both the advantages and drawbacks to this kind of collaboration between teachers and researchers, as well as furnishing suggestions for future OER development.",

Specific reading strategy training was first integrated into a Moodle system, which included reading exercises on problem identification, monitoring comprehension, inferencing, summarizing, transfer, resourcing, and questioning for clarification. The comparison between pre-test and post-test of the experimental group indicated that students had improved their reading comprehension performance after the experimental course was implemented. No significant difference in student reading comprehension performance was found in the control group. Moreover, the learning records were significantly correlated with the post-test of reading comprehension in the experimental group, indicating the positive effect on learning outcome. A questionnaire was also conducted to investigate the students' perceived learning progress and strategy use. Before the instruction took place, there was no difference in strategy use observed between the experimental and control groups. After the instruction, students in the experimental group employed significantly more reading strategies than the students in the control group, especially in the categories of metacognitive and cognitive strategies. The results demonstrate that Moodle-supported strategy instruction can and will facilitate the EFL students' overall reading comprehension and strategy use.",

There is solid evidence supporting the effectiveness of teaching analytical skills and critical thinking skills in a language classroom. This article argues that website analysis exercises and related design education might be a possible way to get students involved in constructive writing practices, and for promoting critical thinking. Research evidence supports website design process as a potentially valuable and energizing experience, and a rhetorical exercise in the technical communication classroom. Twenty-eight students participated in this in-class experiment as reported in this article. The six-week experiment involved analyzing websites with open-ended questions, indirectly based on established design guidelines of the web user experience model as developed by Garrett (2011). Accuracy scores suggest that readers did reasonably well with questions on audience analysis and product goals, and showed promise analyzing questions on navigation/information/interface design, with enough indication that with more feedback and structured assessment mechanism, analytical ability of these non-native readers will improve, resulting in superior English text production and improved analytical ability. However, variability in accuracy scores across weeks also indicate that more practice, feedback, and contextual exposure are required for performance improvement.",

The review of over 350 studies (including classroom-based technologies, individual study tools, network-based social computing, and mobile and portable devices) revealed that, in spite of an abundance of publications available on the topic of technology use in FL learning and teaching, evidence of efficacy is limited. However, strong support for the claim that technology made a measurable impact in FL learning came from studies on computer-assisted pronunciation training, in particular, automatic speech recognition (ASR). These studies demonstrated that ASR can facilitate the improvement of pronunciation and can provide feedback effectively. Additional studies provided strong support for the use of chat in FL learning. These studies showed that, with chat, both the amount of learners&apos; language production and its complexity significantly increased. The literature revealed moderate support for claims that technology enhanced learners&apos; output and interaction, affect and motivation, feedback, and metalinguistic knowledge.",

While students' collaboration, attention to form, and perceptions of wikis in document mode have been widely addressed in previous research, the educational value of wikis used in thread mode, as discussion forums, has been rarely explored. In an attempt to fill this gap in the literature, the present case study reports on 20 EFL learners' contribution to a classroom wiki during a 9-week writing course. The wiki is applied as a forum for out-of-classroom discussions regarding English writing. Focus is placed upon the type and degree of students' contribution to the wiki as well as their attention to form while publishing their messages on the space. A total of 50 wiki posts was analyzed adopting both quantitative and qualitative measures. The results indicated that students were most likely to use the wiki for posing their questions and disseminating solutions for peers. They also appeared highly attentive to the form of their posts in terms of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. This study makes a contribution to research on wiki-based learning.",

    "description": "Instructional support has been widely discussed as a strategy to optimize student-learning experiences. This study examines instructional support within the context of a multimedia language-learning environment, with the predominant focus on learners' perceptions of captioning support for listening comprehension. The study seeks to answer two questions: (1) do learners' perceptions regarding dependence on captions match their actual reliance on captioning for listening comprehension? and (2) which learners' perceptions are most influenced by proficiency: low-intermediate, intermediate, or high-intermediate? A total of 139 students from a high school English course in northern Taiwan, all accustomed to multimedia instruction that includes full captions, completed an English language proficiency test as well as a caption reliance test (CRT), and also provided their perceived degree of reliance on captions for English listening comprehension. The results show that overall perceived reliance was significantly related to actual reliance as assessed by the CRT. However, proficiency was also found to be a mitigating factor in the relationship: while low-intermediate level learners accurately perceived their reliance, no relation was found for either intermediate or high-intermediate learners, indicating that, at these levels, some learners may not accurately judge their reliance on captioning. Accordingly, the study offers pedagogical implications that captioning support, added or removed, based on learner self-reports, may not be inherently beneficial, as perceptions on the reliance of captioning may be inaccurate.",

    "title": "A Courseware to Script Animated Pedagogical Agents in Instructional Material for Elementary Students in English Education",
    "author": "Hong, Zeng-Wei, Chen, Yen-Lin, Lan, Chien-Ho",
    "description": "Animated agents are virtual characters who demonstrate facial expressions, gestures, movements, and speech to facilitate students' engagement in the learning environment. Our research developed a courseware that supports a XML-based markup language and an authoring tool for teachers to script animated pedagogical agents in teaching materials. The design of the markup language refers to Mayer's segmenting principle that is efficient for assisting a teacher to edit teaching contents into a set of segments and further organize the segments in a given lesson in class. This paper details a case study of applying the proposed courseware for elementary students in English education, and further investigates how the instructional materials scripted using the courseware affect the learning achievement of students. Two groups of participants from an elementary school in Taiwan enrolled in this experiment. The experimental group used animated agent-based instructional materials in their English classroom, whereas the control group participated in a traditional curriculum. Post-test results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group. Our experiment demonstrated that the developed courseware provides an opportunity for scripting animated pedagogical agents as appropriate instructional tools in a computer-assisted language learning environment to foster elementary students' English learning.",

    "author": "Yang, Yu-Fen",
    "description": "Research on preparing language teachers for blended teaching of summary writing, a mix of on-site and online instruction for college students to grasp the gist of the texts, is scarce in higher education. This study examined the problems encountered and solutions proposed by six language teachers, who altogether instructed 214 college students on summary writing. The findings of this study are based on content analyses of the teachers' interview transcripts, the teachers' observation of college students' progress in on-site and online instruction, and the interactions among the students recorded in the log files of the online system. The results show that the language teachers' problems in blended teaching of summary writing fell into three categories: instructional processes, community concerns, and technical issues. The four main themes that emerged from the three categories include the following: (1) the changing roles of the teachers and students, (2) little sense of community building, (3) lack of training in blended teaching of summary writing, and (4) an unfamiliarity with the new systems or technologies. The language teachers' perspectives on solving these problems were to (1) distinguish the significant differences between on-site and online language teaching contexts, (2) identify strategies and techniques to facilitate students' blended learning in summary writing, and (3) develop community building skills to encourage teachers and students to actively participate in collaborative learning. These solutions shed light on the preparation of language teachers in blended teaching of summary writing.",

    "author": "Qian, Kan, McCormick, Robert",
    "description": "This paper examines a sample of online discussion data from the course forum for the large-scale beginners' Chinese course offered by the UK Open University. This forum is open to all registered students, their participation is completely voluntary and they (rather than tutors) initiate communications. The aim of this study is (i) to seek to establish the nature, patterns of use and functions of forums amongst distance language learners of beginners' Chinese; (ii) to provide a greater understanding of the role and the significance of learner participation in online forums, and how forums contribute towards Chinese language learning and (iii) to offer a fresh perspective on the understanding of distant Chinese language learning experience, involving a relatively under-reported group of learners. Quantitative data collected from questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews were analysed together with the routine forum data. The analysis indicates that most students had a very positive experience of the forum. The sense of belonging to a group with the same shared goal of learning Chinese helped them deal with the challenges of learning Chinese. They perceived the online discussion forum as a virtual meeting place where they could find support and help, and where they could share their learning experiences, resources, difficulties and frustrations as well as sense of achievement. The analysis also shows that the forum played a very important role in creating course cohesion, supporting the learning of Chinese and making the learning process enjoyable and fun.",

    "author": "Quintana-Lara, Marcela",
    "description": "This study investigates the effects of Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction on the production of the English phonological contrast /i/ and / I /. Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction is based on the assumption that physical representations of speech sounds and spectrography allow learners to objectively see and modify those non-accurate features in their oral production which may impede effective communication in the target language. Twenty-six pre-service non-native English teachers, 16 in the experimental group and 10 in the control group, participated in the investigation. During a two-week period, the experimental group received Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction while the control group was exposed to a more traditional pronunciation approach. Production accuracy of the target segments was evaluated by two production tasks and a perceptual identification task. Acoustic measurements from the production tasks show that Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction significantly improved pronunciation of both vowels. Data from perceptual identification also indicate pronunciation improvement of both vowels, particularly for English / I /. Taken together, the results of these three experiments lend support to the use of acoustic features of speech and spectrography in English segmental acquisition.",

    "author": "Thang, Siew Ming, Lin, Luck Kee, Mahmud, Najihah, Ismail, Kemboja, Zabidi, Noraza Ahmad",
    "description": "Digital storytelling, which combines the art of storytelling with a variety of digital audio, video, and multimedia images, has been increasingly used as a language learning tool as research studies have shown it to be effective in enhancing the development of language skills as well as related language learning skills, such as autonomy, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. However, before successful language learning can take place, teachers' concerns regarding technology adoption has to be explored, especially since there is very little research in this area in the Malaysian context. This study addresses this gap in knowledge by sharing the concerns of four English as Second Language (ESL) instructors in terms of their attitudes and acceptance of the use of technology in the form of digital storytelling in teaching ESL at a Malaysian public university. &quot;Concern&quot; in this study refers to the evoked feelings and perceptions towards an innovation and the change process. The data of the study are drawn from the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) and interviews of the instructors. The findings revealed that the teachers perceive the technology to be beneficial to their students to a certain extent; however, resistance to the technology was particularly strong in two of the instructors and this could lead to failure in technology integration.",

However, we will describe how in this study, the OER program was integrated into college credit courses for elementary German at the University of Pennsylvania to provide the themes and grammar topics for live online class sessions and out-of-class asynchronous assignments, which included the use of blogs for essays, Facebook for shorter written assignments and Wimba Voiceboards for oral practice. In addition, this article will show how &quot;Deutsch Interaktiv&quot; ultimately influenced educational practice in the online classroom and within the context of interactionist learning theories.",

    "author": "Toetenel, Lisette",
    "description": "Studies undertaken since the introduction of Web 2.0 have focussed mainly on open educational resources (OERs) such as email, blogging and virtual learning environments. No consistent efforts have been undertaken to study the use of social networking sites as a tool for learning in the second language classroom. This study examined the use of social networking sites as a means of establishing an asynchronous online environment for use in language learning in a classroom setting. The findings described are based on the use of a social networking site called Ning in a classroom during a summer school project, which was conducted at a further education college in the UK. The project focussed in particular on informal language practice when using social networking sites. The paper then examines the effect the use of the social networking tool had on group cohesion and learner-to-learner interaction, and how these, in turn, enhanced informal language learning due to an increase in learner collaboration. The study found that the use of Ning enhanced group cohesion and that learners started working in different groups once Ning was introduced. Finally, it highlights the potential technical and administrative barriers that can impede an institution in implementing its educational strategy in regards to OERs -- in this case, social networking sites in the classroom. The further education college in which this study took place had no policies in place in regards to the use of OERs in the classroom, thus the paper concludes with recommendations in regards to training and policies so that researchers and practitioners can learn from the project.",

    "description": "This study examines the effects of interactive versus simultaneous display of visual and verbal multimedia information on incidental vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of learners of English with lower proficiency levels. In the interactive display condition, learners were allowed to select the type of multimedia information whereas the simultaneous display condition presented the verbal (definitions) and visual (associated pictures) information in a single gloss. Eighty-two students were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions and were asked to read an annotated expository text. Reading comprehension was measured through a recall protocol and a multiple-choice test. Incidental vocabulary learning was measured through unannounced vocabulary tests of form recognition, meaning production, definition match, and bilingual synonym match. T-tests and ANOVA analyses indicated that the participants utilized glosses less frequently when they were given the control over access to the type of multimedia information. In addition, simultaneous display of multimedia information led to better performance on reading and vocabulary tests. The results are in line with the contiguity principle of Generative Theory of Multimedia Learning, which posits that presenting verbal and visual information simultaneously reduces cognitive load and results in better learning. The findings have implications for both the development of multimedia materials for L2 learners and training of learners to interact with multimedia materials.",

    "author": "Burston, Jack",
    "description": "In this paper the development of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) over the past 20\u00a0years is reviewed with a particular focus on the pedagogical challenges facing its exploitation. Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use. The future of MALL lies in the exploitation of the communication and multimedia affordances of mobile devices in ways that support collaborative, task-based learning both within and outside of the classroom.",

    "description": "This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a year-long reading while listening (RWL) program run for university first-year students at a private university in Japan. The program was developed to give students practice in listening to a large volume of spoken English--a practice that the majority of Japanese students lack. The students in the program (N = 230) practiced RWL and took progress tests using a Moodle module that also kept records of their progress (MoodleReader). The program was evaluated in two ways: by measuring student gains in reading rate, vocabulary recognition, and general English proficiency, as measured by the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and by investigating student attitudes toward the program itself and the MoodleReader through the use of a 24-item questionnaire. Results of the evaluation showed RWL had a significant effect on reading rate and vocabulary recognition, but not for general English proficiency. Questionnaire results uncovered negative attitudes toward the RWL program and the MoodleReader, and that these attitudes affected the amount of work students completed in the program. The findings suggest that user interface and ease of use are the key factors to consider when implementing such a program.",

    "author": "Cerezo, Luis, Baralt, Melissa, Suh, Bo-Ram, Leow, Ronald P.",
    "description": "Currently, an increasing number of educational institutions are redefining second/foreign language (L2) classrooms by enhancing--or even replacing--traditional face-to-face (FTF) instruction with computer-assisted language learning (CALL). However, are these curricular decisions supported by research? Overall, a cursory review of empirical studies appears to provide strong support for the use of CALL. Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality. To this end, we provide methodological recommendations that may raise the internal and external validity of future research designs as the empirical interest in CALL continues to blossom.",

    "description": "Help options, or in-built application resources designed to provide assistance, have long been an integral component of computer-based second language (L2) listening materials. Despite their potential to promote comprehension and efficiency, research on the role of help options has lagged. Previous research has found that learners do not often make use of help options. With a focus on the interventions listeners may deem relevant for comprehension and task completion, the aim of this qualitative study is to examine the interactions of language learners as they use, or do not use, these potentially assistive resources. Data were gathered from 15 adult learners of English who worked with a set of Longman English Interactive \u00a9 (2008) listening exercises over three one-hour sessions. Within two studies, each participant was interviewed on three and six different occasions. Through our cyclical analysis of the data, five themes emerged: Relevance, Challenge, Familiarity, Recovery and Compatibility. We define and discuss each theme, and we conclude the article with suggestions for further research.",

We sought to investigate how far working with open content could offer language tutors opportunities to develop professionally and acquire new technical knowledge for language teaching. Language educators face particular motivational challenges, and often have a lack of training in the use of technology for teaching. We applied a self-efficacy theory of motivation to understand the extent to which tutors felt confident and capable about open practice, and whether they perceived development benefits. On the whole our findings suggest that open practice may be an effective vehicle for professional development, for enhancing knowledge of technology in teaching and for alleviating some specific motivational barriers faced by language educators. However, they also revealed significant issues which challenge tutors' likelihood of continuing with open practice, which would need to be addressed for the benefits of open working to be fully realised.",

In a between-subjects design, participants in two intermediate-level Russian classes were assigned to the two conditions and completed study tasks three times a week for six weeks. In the interactive condition, student pairs engaged in synchronous text-chat sessions, completing tasks designed to encourage interaction through information-, reasoning-, or opinion-gaps. In the individual condition, students completed comparable writing activities on their own. Both conditions provided the same language input and required production, over an equivalent amount of time. Language gains were assessed through vocabulary, writing, and speaking pre-and post-tests. Students in the interactive condition showed greater gains in vocabulary knowledge and oral production than students in the individual condition; no differences were found in students&apos; writing accuracy or complexity. Students in the interactive condition also produced more Russian types and tokens in their homework assignments than students in the individual condition, both at the beginning and later in the study. These results support the benefits of interactive homework for L2 learning and production.",

Using Inputlog 4.0 and Camtasia 6.0 to record the writing process of 24 Chinese EFL writers in an argumentative task, this study explored L2 writers' pausing patterns in computer-assisted writing settings and how their pausing patterns related to writing time allocation, writing fluency, and text quality. Results suggest that while the skilled writers allocated significantly less time to the prewriting stage, they paused significantly longer yet less frequently than the less-skilled group in this stage; however, the two groups displayed no significant difference in pause frequency or duration in the composing stage. Text quality was found to correlate positively with prewriting pause duration and writing fluency but negatively with the prewriting time. Web search and dictionary use were identified as important extra writing activities that gave rise to the observed time allocation and pausing patterns. These findings suggest that computer-assisted L2 writing has features distinct from pen-and-paper writing and that L2 writers need to be informed of how to coordinate and regulate writing resources in an electronic environment.",

    "description": "With the rise of information availability and the speed at which it can be disseminated, it is now the consumer's job to exercise more discernment and to become more skeptical about the information coming across their screens. This is a major point in the argument to adopt a relatively new academic discipline known as News Literacy. A subset of media literacy, News Literacy focuses solely on the consumption of news items--whether it is a blurb from a friend, a blog, or a reputable news source. The News Literacy course seeks to equip news consumers with a set of tools to help them determine the reliability of incoming information. This allows them to access the news before they perpetuate it to their own social networks. To test the efficacy of certain aspects of the News Literacy course, such as verification of information disseminated through social networks, the researchers developed an interactive learning activity to enable students to experience the process via a fictionalized story. This article will explain the reasoning behind the activity's development and will also report the results of the first case study executed in a News Literacy class at Stony Brook University in the spring of 2014.",

    "author": "Straub, Jeremy",
    "description": "The development of software for spacecraft represents a particular challenge and is, in many ways, a worst case scenario from a design perspective. Spacecraft software must be &quot;bulletproof&quot; and operate for extended periods of time without user intervention. If the software fails, it cannot be manually serviced. Software failure may result in mission degradation or complete spacecraft loss. This article considers how learning technologies can be used to aid student understanding of spacecraft software design, to facilitate the creation of better spacecraft software. It presents a framework for comparing spacecraft software development learning technologies. It then evaluates and compares five prospective learning technologies based on this framework. The areas that each learning technology is particularly well suited for are presented and discussed.",

    "description": "The present study examined the relationship among learners' differences, behaviors in manipulating variables, and learning achievements in a simulation-based program that supports discovery learning in the subject of C-programming algorithm. Participants (n = 66) took the Group Embedded Figures Test, Action Control Scale, and Computer Self-Efficacy Scale to determine their field dependence, action-state orientation, and computer self-efficacy before interacting with the simulation program. Results from this study have shown that reading domain information supported learners to manipulate more simulation variables systematically. In addition, manipulating simulation variables in a systematic manner positively affects learning post-test achievement. In the context of individual differences, failure-related action control and computer self-efficacy were found to affect learners' behaviors in manipulating variables, while field dependence was shown to affect learning post-test achievement. Implications for both theoretical and instructional designs are discussed in terms of how various support types can accommodate the needs of different learners in simulation programs.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to identify constructivist concepts that are important to student-perceived learning outcomes in college courses that use a virtual world, such as Second Life, as an educational tool. Identification of these concepts will help instructors to make the best use of their course design efforts in mediated environments. Subsequently, this will benefit students by matching the learning environment to students' learning needs and potential preferences. This study used a web-based survey that asked respondents about their perceptions of how their experience in a class using a virtual world as an instructional tool represented several constructivist learning concepts. Their responses were compared to how they felt about different learning outcomes. The results indicate that authentic learning context is a major factor in all of the student-perceived learning outcomes measured in this study, while student responsibility and initiative is important to academic learning time and learning progress.",

The result of this study lent support to the social agency theory: personalized narration in multimedia learning positively affects learners' computer perceptions and task-related attitudes. Contrary to the authors' prediction, personalized narration did not positively affect field dependent learners' computer perceptions and task-related attitudes. Instead, it was shown that field independent learners were marginally more anxious in learning task when learning with personalized narration than with non-personalized narration.",

More specifically, online electronic laboratory courses are delivered online with students performing the same experiments as those in traditional offerings. This is made possible via innovative use of technology. Further, through insights developed in the initial offering, a new laboratory kit is being designed. Finally, some of our online lectures developed in the program are also being used to supplement and enrich on-campus offerings, hence creating a win-win approach.",

    "author": "Cuff, Ed",
    "description": "From elementary schooling to doctoral-level education, technology has become an integral part of the learning process in and out of the classroom. With the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards, the skills required for research are more valuable than ever, for they are required to succeed in a college setting, as well as in the business world. Traditional paperbased materials and methods have been left behind, while Web 2.0 tools and other technologies and programs are used to discover, gather, and organize information. Collaboration is encouraged and feedback has become a part of constructing drafts and disseminating discovered information and written material. The aim of this article is to answer the question, &quot;How does technology affect the teaching and learning of the research process, and why is it important to enforce technology use into the teaching of the research process?&quot; In other words, this article intends to discover how different research technologies are used during each step of the research process, as well as how effective these tools are in making research more efficient or instead, a consequentially more complicated process. Within schools, opposing views may further complicate the process of learning research methods, for in libraries, a greater emphasis and reliance is placed on online databases and search engines as an access point to acquire information; however, other educators and historians prefer a traditional method of research by relying on primary and paper-based resources. Therefore, this article analyzes what is currently being done with the research process in education with or without technology use, and what must occur in order for educators and students to experience more efficiency, understanding, and success while conducting research.",

    "description": "Enhanced ways of thinking about learners, learning, and communication in the 21st century across content areas coupled with technologies that can extend the outreach beyond text, time, and geography can accelerate learning and retention in higher education, professional organizations, and learning environments. However, many assumptions about time, situation, learning goals, and learner capabilities have been embedded in face-to-face and online approaches. Thus, when moving to the more dynamic designs available today, instructors, educators, and communicators must also carefully scaffold the environment to integrate effectively these emerging tools and understandings. Otherwise, what could be enriched learning can become confusion and frustration. This article outlines both ways to design and integrate content, learners, technology and communication tools, and assessment, thus enabling dynamic, 21st century learning and ways to scaffold and balance instructional supports, pacing, and interaction-planning thereby providing guidance for the rich learning that is possible in integrated, technology-supported environments.",

Furthermore, attitudes toward online learning improve after a semester of blended support. An increase in digital tool use frequency was recorded and students reported growing interest in learning, and using, digital tools. Additionally, students reported an increased engagement with, and better retention of, course material when creating disciplinary digital projects. Conclusions indicate that offering blended (online and face-to-face) support for digital projects across the curriculum is effective for improving digital literacy.",

Findings show that participants usage of the application correlated with their average scores on the quizzes in the application. The more participants used the application, the higher they scored on the quizzes which was the most used feature of the application. Findings show that usage of the application can be predicted by a variety of factors, such as language proficiency, users' average daily usage of their mobile devices, and motivation and learning goals. Findings also underscore the importance of providing language learners with resources to help them learn idiomatic expressions and collocation. Participants strongly indicated that even within a short period of time, they felt they know more idioms and collocations since they started using the application. Findings also show that participants' have strong positive attitudes toward the use of mobile technology in language learning.",

    "description": "This paper examines how L2 learners of Korean manifest pragmatic competence in their use of address terms in computer mediated communication (CMC) and how they use these terms to negotiate their identities. Four UK-based learners of Korean with competence levels ranging from Novice High through Intermediate High participated in the study, contributing transcripts of CMC interactions and participating in retrospective interviews over a three-month period. Qualitative analysis of the data shows that CMC provided a fertile context for these learners to manifest pragmatic competence in the use of address terms and to progress beyond classroom learning. Address terms also worked as powerful tools for these learners to establish intimate relationships with Korean acquaintances and negotiate identities as legitimate speakers of the language. However, this process of identity negotiation was complicated by gaps in their pragmatic competence, their preexisting identities and differing expectations on the part of Korean interlocutors. Ultimately, the analysis shows that the question of what constitutes &quot;appropriate&quot; use of address terms in CMC interactions involving L2 learners of Korean is unstable and open to negotiation. The implications of this finding for future research and for KSL (Korean as a Second Language) teaching methodologies are addressed in the conclusion.",

    "description": "The present study examines the professional growth of three Chinese English teachers by analyzing their interactional patterns and their social and cognitive presence in an online community. The data from social network analysis (SNA) and content analysis revealed that computer-mediated communication (CMC) created new opportunities for teachers to interact personally, socially and professionally with other fellow teachers with whom they would otherwise not have contact in their working milieu. At the initial stage of their online communication, newcomers to the forum were more likely to rely on vertical relationships, preferring to communicate with people with more expertise or power in the community. New horizontal, peer-to-peer relationships emerged with their increasing involvement in online discussion. Moreover, codes of social presence were frequently used by the participants, especially by the peripheral members in the community. &quot;Elucidating&quot; was the most frequent category of cognitive presence codes used by all the participants while the codes of the other three phases varied with individual teachers. No significant change was observed in the development of cognitive presence likely due to the effect of the time variable. The study has some practical implications for the professional development of language teachers in an online community.",

Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning.",

Twenty-two college students enrolled in second year Spanish in a technology-enhanced classroom participated in the study. Two types of medium of delivery of input were compared: mobile assisted language learning (MALL), which is learner manipulated, and instructor manipulated language learning (IMLL). A quasi-experimental design was used -- treatment and immediate tests -- in order to measure participants&apos; reported noticing and type of comprehension. Noticing was operationalized using think-aloud protocols, and measured on the post-test exposure comprehension assessment tasks. The findings of the study, interpreted within the attentional SLA framework, indicate that learners in the MALL group demonstrated significantly higher levels of reported noticing, bottom-up comprehension, and top-down overall comprehension than learners in the IMLL group. Directions for future research as well as pedagogical implications of the use of mobile technology and task-based listening activities are offered.",

The findings suggest that output modality may affect how learners produce language, attend to linguistic forms, and solve communicative problems. In particular, the use of collaborative processes to construct utterances was more prevalent in F2F interaction than in SCMC. Moreover, learners engaged in activities and produced language differently depending on output modalities, which differed in terms of the physical, social, and interactional contexts that they created and the way in which they influenced learners' communication strategies. The findings indicate that SCMC should be used selectively according to the pedagogical purpose.",

    "description": "In the past decade, a new wave of writing assessment has evolved as a result of advances in computer technology, highlighting the potential of automated writing evaluation (AWE) in the L2 writing curriculum (Warschauer &amp; Ware, 2006). Today's innovative AWE programs offer ESL instructors promising solutions for providing immediate feedback and meeting the demands for better practices in the digital age. However, the outcomes of using AWE programs are not free of challenges and necessitate comprehensive insights about effectively integrating AWE and improving students' writing (Chen &amp; Cheng, 2008). This longitudinal qualitative study investigates the practices and perspectives of five university-level writing instructors as they meet challenges and possibilities of integrating AWE into seven semester-long university ESL writing courses. Data collection included observations, individual interviews, and delayed focus group interviews. In this paper, we highlight ESL instructors' teaching strategies, perception of the effectiveness, satisfaction, and concerns with the software during and after one semester of teaching. Results conclude with final suggestions from current instructors. Our research intends to expand the current knowledge of AWE programs by defining appropriate and effective implementation of AWE technologies.",

    "author": "Darhower, Mark Anthony",
    "description": "In this study, dynamic assessment is employed to help understand the developmental processes of two university Spanish learners as they produce a series of past narrations in a synchronous computer mediated environment. The assessments were conducted in six weekly one-hour chat sessions about various scenes of a Spanish language film. The analysis illuminates the zone of proximal development of the participants, characterizing not only their current level of independent functioning, but also their potential when provided with mediation. The utility of synchronous computer mediated communication as a medium for dynamic assessment is also discussed.",

    "description": "The purpose of the study is to investigate how pre-service teachers adopt YouTube technology into their microteaching as part of their assignments. The participants were twelve Taiwanese pre-service teachers in a Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages graduate program. They enrolled in a Second Language Writing course and worked in groups to develop and upload microteaching videos on YouTube. In addition, the pre-service teachers had to recruit students to learn from their YouTube lessons in order to make observations on their learning. The results were fourfold: (1) the pre-service teachers employed a variety of styles and approaches in their YouTube lessons; (2) the pre-service teachers held mildly positive attitudes toward the YouTube microteaching project and revealed their gains in the perceptual shift about teaching, connecting theory and practice, and gaining hands-on experience in computer-assisted language learning; (3) the pre-service teachers encountered varying degrees of technical difficulty in producing the YouTube microteaching videos; and (4) a number of factors affecting the delivery and quality of the microteaching lessons were found (e.g. sources of anxiety, shifts in motivation, a strong focus on visuals and personal appearance, lack of student feedback and interaction).",

    "author": "Taylor, Alan",
    "description": "This study challenges the assertion that an increase in L1 glossing results in more L2 reading comprehension. The results of this study, a quantitative meta-analysis, indicate that there is a significant difference (p = 0.04) in L2 reading comprehension between groups based on how much L1 glossing is provided. It was found that the group with the highest average effect size--which had all computer-assisted language learning (CALL) studies--included studies with 50% or more L1 glossing. However, the second largest mean effect size came from a group that contained 5% or less L1 glossing. In looking across groups in this meta-analysis, it was found that of the six studies with the largest effect sizes, five of them were CALL studies. In light of this finding, this paper will discuss the interaction of the variables of CALL glossing and percentage of text glossed in order to determine their possible influence on L2 reading comprehension.",

    "description": "This study is aimed at identifying reading strategies of beginning learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) with and without a pop-up dictionary and at determining if learners retain the reading comprehension gained from using the dictionary. Beginning CFL learners at a Midwestern university answered questions about their reading strategies after reading passages in Chinese with and without a pop-up dictionary, did think-aloud protocols, and wrote recalls. Qualitative analyses of answers and think-aloud protocols identified generally-used strategies both with and without the pop-up dictionary: engaging in bottom-up strategies, monitoring comprehension, using the first language, and focusing on lexical cues. Qualitative analyses also revealed different reading strategies in obtaining character and word meanings and in constructing sentence meanings. Statistical results indicated that much of the improvement gained from using the pop-up dictionary during the first reading was not retained over a short period of time. It may be concluded that the use of the pop-up dictionary may not alter CFL learners' general reading strategies, yet the dictionary does provide additional resources to facilitate meaning construction. Hence, it is relevant to guide students to effectively use the pop-up dictionary.",

    "description": "Despite the large number of published articles dealing with Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) applications over the past two decades, very few relate to the curricular integration of mobile technologies beyond initial projects. This situation raises a primary research question as to whether or not MALL implementation publications reflect the actual extent to which MALL has been incorporated into the curriculum. In order to determine the actual state of curricular integration, an online survey of published MALL practitioners was conducted . The survey established that nearly 60% of initial MALL projects had subsequently led to curricular integration. The factors that most facilitated the integration of MALL into the curriculum are all directly related to the success of the initial project. Institutional factors likewise played an important part in the subsequent incorporation of MALL into the curriculum, with the encouragement of the administration, financial support and technological infrastructure being the most positive in this regard. On the other hand, the lack of financial and technological support was deemed to constitute a substantial negative factor. Likewise, when it existed, curricular flexibility played a major positive role in making MALL integration possible, whereas the absence of curricular flexibility was considered a significant negative impediment. So, too, overall the willingness of colleagues to engage with MALL, their pedagogical training and technological expertise were all viewed as contributing positively to MALL integration, though not without a notable level of negative influence.",

    "description": "This mixed-method study explored the impact of &quot;Food Force (FF)&quot;, a UN-sponsored off-the-shelf videogame, on learner affect and vocabulary learning and retention in a Japanese as a second/foreign language classroom. The videogame was integrated into an existing curriculum and two studies were performed. In Study 1 (n = 9), new vocabulary was embedded in task sheets. Study 2 (n = 11) introduced &quot;FF&quot; vocabulary explicitly and included a graded unit test. In both studies, participants took three &quot;FF&quot; vocabulary tests (pre-, post-, delayed) and an end-of-unit affect survey. Study 2 also included textbook vocabulary tests and interviews. Results indicated positive impact on learner affect and a preference for game-mediated activities over conventional exercises. Within-subject repeated-measure analysis revealed that participants in both groups recalled new &quot;FF&quot; vocabulary five weeks later at the same rate as immediately after the unit, while they significantly forgot words from the textbook. Study 2 resulted in better learning of &quot;FF&quot; words than Study 1. No gender difference was found in vocabulary test results. Positive &quot;FF&quot; effects may be evidence that digital game-based learning facilitates deep learning. Though there was significant positive effect on average, individual differences were found in students&apos; attitudes and vocabulary retention.",

    "description": "Collaborative writing (CW) research has gained prevalence in recent years. However, the ways in which students interact socially to produce written texts through synchronous collaborative writing (SCW) is rarely studied. This study aims to investigate the effects of SCW on students' writing products and how collaborative dialogues facilitate SCW. Following an initial analysis, 54 students were divided into 18 groups; six groups with higher proportions of collaborative dialogue (HCD), six groups with median proportions of collaborative dialogue (MCD), and six groups with lower proportions of collaborative dialogue (LCD). The data collected includes the students' three reaction essays, their transcripts of text-based collaborative dialogues, and their writing process logs. The results showed that there were significant differences between the LCD, MCD, and HCD groups in terms of fluency and accuracy of their reaction essays. Through collaborative dialogues, students benefitted from text-based synchronous communications, such as clarifying their linguistic misconceptions, and receiving immediate feedback to help resolve their writing problems. The findings suggest that students could be provided with more opportunities for collaborative dialogues during the entire writing process, including the stages of generating ideas, writing reaction essays, and editing.",

Using open, internationally accepted standards for materials development is no absolute guarantee of longevity, but it does increase the likelihood that content will continue to be usable and that, if needed, conversion tools will be available. In this column I will be discussing approaches to the development of electronically delivered language learning materials that I believe are the least likely to face short-term obsolescence. I will be arguing in favor of multilaterally developed, open standards, supported by major industry players and educational standards bodies. Specifically, I will be looking at approaches for delivering learning materials through Web browsers or e-book readers (e-readers), so that created content works seamlessly across devices and platforms",

    "description": "With the growing prevalence of Web 2.0 technologies and use of online resources in their classrooms, language learners have increasing exposure to online texts. In this study we attempted to understand how university level second language (L2) readers construct meaning when reading online. We investigated L2 readers' information-seeking strategies and decision-making processes as they read online. Seven participants were asked to read two online texts and answer comprehension questions. Observation, think-aloud protocols, and interviews were our main sources of data. Through careful thematic coding analysis, we were able to characterize L2 readers' processes of constructing meaning while reading online using Internet resources. The findings indicate that L2 readers employ considerable prior knowledge of the structure of both offline and online resources to aid their online reading. Also, they follow a recursive pattern of self-regulated reading strategies when they construct meanings. Some themes highlighted by the study include L2 readers' online knowledge construction, their demonstration of cognitive flexibility, and the emergence of new literacy skills.",

    "description": "This study focuses on the use of wikis in collaborative writing projects in foreign language learning classrooms. A total of 34 intermediate level university students learning English as a foreign language (EFL) were asked to accomplish three different wiki-based collaborative writing tasks, (argumentative, informative and decision-making) working in groups of four. Student wiki pages were then analyzed to investigate the role of task type in the number of self and peer-corrections as well as form-related and meaning-related changes. In addition, focus-group interviews and questionnaires were conducted to find out how students would describe their overall experience with the integration of a wiki-based collaborative writing project in their foreign language learning process. The results revealed that the argumentative task promoted more peer-corrections than the informative and decision-making tasks. In addition, the informative task yielded more self-corrections than the argumentative and decision-making tasks. Furthermore, the use of wiki-based collaborative writing tasks led to the accurate use of grammatical structures 94% of the time. The results of the study also suggest that students paid more attention to meaning rather than form regardless of the task type. Finally, students had positive experiences using wikis in foreign language writing, and they believed that their writing performance had improved.",

Ten students and one teacher used &quot;Twitter&quot; in an intensive, English as a second language advanced grammar course to practice writing sentences with complex grammatical constructions from the academic genre. In turn, the students received occasional corrective feedback from the instructor. Drawing on qualitative data consisting of a corpus of time- and date-stamped tweets, retrospective interviews and discourse analysis of the students' tweets, the author presents three &quot;micro-vignettes&quot; demonstrating how three students responded to contradictions within the original task by qualitatively transforming its context. As a result, they created new learning opportunities, 'spinning-off' (Wertsch, 1998) the microblogging tool, due to the tool's features, the students' previous cultures-of-use, (Thorne, 2003) and their pre-existing social networks (Stefanone &amp; Gay, 2008). The students used Twitter as an instant messaging chat room, moving from the sentence to the utterance (Bakhtin, 1953/1986), embedding target grammar constructions in various forms of ludic language play (Cook, 2000). By dynamically reframing (Goffman, 1974) their own learning activities students took ownership of the task and went through a process of expansive learning (Eng\u00ebstrom, 2007).",

    "description": "Can online collaboration yield a positive effect on academic writing in a foreign language? If so, what exactly is the added value, compared to individual writing, and (how) does it translate to better output? These are the central questions addressed in this paper. L2 writing research has long highlighted the benefits of collaboration in terms of both L2 learning and text quality. Most recently, the positive effect of co-ownership and peer feedback on process and product has been emphasized in studies on Computer-Supported Collaborative Writing. What has remained underexplored is the impact of web 2.0 technologies on &quot;advanced&quot; L2 writing. The present paper bridges this gap through an empirical study combining Web 2.0 technologies with an academic writing task. Collaborative and individual writing processes and products are compared by applying a mixed-methods approach. The results shed new light on claims made in previous studies that collaboration leads to higher text accuracy. No statistically relevant difference was found between the individual and collaborative syntheses in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. However, collaborative texts score significantly higher on appropriate content selection and organization. Analysis of the process data shows that this is due to in-depth discussions during the planning phase.",

Using a quasi-experimental methodology relevant data was collected from both groups during a whole academic year just before their EFL-PAU. The hypothesis that students who used Web 2.0 based materials (forums, collaborative glossaries, social repositories with annotated past papers, podcasts, social bookmarking, a wiki and a blog) instead of traditional EFL (English as a foreign language) resources achieved better results was quantitatively confirmed. Furthermore, it was qualitatively proved that Web 2.0 tools in EFL increase motivation in students, a crucial aspect for the achievement of good scores in the English section of the EFL-PAU. All these Web 2.0 tools were located in a Moodle course, one of the most widely used virtual learning environments. Although not strictly speaking a Web 2.0 tool, Moodle facilitates interactive information sharing, online collaboration and is user/learner-centered, all of which are key features in a Web 2.0 digital education context.",

    "author": "Yoon, Hyunsook, Jo, Jung Won",
    "description": "Studies on students' use of corpora in L2 writing have demonstrated the benefits of corpora not only as a linguistic resource to improve their writing abilities but also as a cognitive tool to develop their learning skills and strategies. Most of the corpus studies, however, adopted either direct use or indirect use of corpora by students, without comparing the effectiveness between the two applications. This case study seeks to develop new lines of inquiry by comparing the effectiveness and learning strategy use in corpus-based writing revision. Four Korean EFL students used introspective and retrospective research instruments in an investigation of the effects of corpus use on error correction, error correction patterns, and learning strategy use between the two approaches. While we caution about drawing a conclusion from this small case study, the needs-based approach to corpus use in L2 writing was found to be effective for restructuring the learners' errant knowledge about language use. The approach drove students to actively adopt cognitive learning strategies by performing as &quot;language detectives.&quot; Different effectiveness and learning strategy uses were also observed relative to the corpus use contexts as well as according to student proficiency levels. We also found pedagogical implications, which will be discussed, in relation to the two different corpus applications.",

    "title": "Ecological Affordance and Anxiety in an Oral Asynchronous Computer-Mediated Environment",
    "author": "McNeil, Levi",
    "description": "Previous research suggests that the affordances (van Lier, 2000) of asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) environments help reduce foreign language anxiety (FLA). However, FLA is rarely the focus of these studies and research has not adequately addressed the relationship between FLA and the affordances that students use. This study explored sources of FLA in an oral ACMC environment, and how the affordances perceived by students in this environment correlated with FLA. One class of Korean EFL university students (n = 15) completed voiceboard tasks for eight weeks. Affordance data were collected with a questionnaire, and FLA was measured qualitatively and by employing an adapted version of the foreign language classroom anxiety scale (Horwitz, Horwitz, &amp; Cope, 1986). The results suggest that students experience FLA in particular ways using the voice board, and that some sources of anxiety are similar to those reported in face-to-face contexts and others are unique to ACMC contexts. Additionally, this study found a moderate correlation between the total use of affordances and FLA, with some affordances being associated with reduced anxiety and some associated with higher anxiety. The study discusses these findings and identifies avenues for future research examining the interplay between the ACMC environment and FLA.",

    "description": "Since online educational technology can support a ubiquitous language learning environment, there are many ways to develop English learners' autonomy through self-access learning. This study investigates whether English as a second language (ESL) learners can improve their oral proficiency through independent study by using online self-study resources, online recording program and speech-text-program (STP), and feedback in an autonomous learning environment. This experimental study is designed to provide opportunities for recording stories on weekly topics outside the classroom for five ESL learners who were in the advanced and high intermediated level at City College of San Francisco. In order to assess participants' autonomy for oral proficiency improvement, this research employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Four assessments were used to check participants' developing speaking improvement in storytelling about silent movie clips onto VoiceThread and three questionnaires to assess their attitudes toward this autonomous learning. Results revealed that using self-study resources enables learners to develop speaking skills and build considerable self-confidence. Participants also indicated that learning through storytelling can be learner-centered to increase autonomy in oral proficiency, Furthermore, this research shows that the instructor's feedback and tole are also important during the development learners' learning autonomy based on their engagement.",

    "author": "Olson, Daniel J.",
    "description": "While a growing body of research has established the benefits of pronunciation training on second language (L2) production, these benefits have yet to be incorporated into the general skills language classroom in a systematic manner. Furthermore, although relatively new speech analysis software has been shown to be useful in providing visual feedback for L2 suprasegmental (i.e., intonation) production, there is a relative lack of research on its potential implementation for segmental instruction. The current paper presents a systematic analysis of the effectiveness of a visual feedback paradigm (VFP), in an L2 Spanish classroom, as a pedagogical method for pronunciation teaching at the segmental level (i.e., Spanish intervocalic stops). Results demonstrate a significant improvement of L2 stop production relative to a control group receiving traditional pronunciation feedback. Furthermore, findings demonstrate that VFP leads to small incremental gains. Discussion addresses the role of VFP on segmental production and the potential practical implementations of visual feedback in the lower-level, general skills language classroom.",

In Taiwan, learners have few opportunities to experience cross-cultural communication in English. To create an authentic EFL classroom, this one-year action research study carried out three collaborative intercultural projects using web-based tools (online forums, weblogs, Skype, and email) in a 7th grade EFL class. The projects were designed to improve students' language skills and intercultural communicative competence (ICC). To triangulate the findings, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to collect the data; specifically, questionnaires, interviews, and document analyses were used to investigate the learners' responses and learning processes. The results revealed that the participants had strong positive attitudes towards technology-enhanced intercultural language learning (TEILI), which enabled the learners to experience authentic language learning that fostered linguistic competence and ICC. The findings suggest that TEILI approximates real-life learning contexts by allowing students to use a language for the same purposes that they will use it outside school.",

    "author": "Lin, Huifen",
    "description": "Drawing on interactionist and socio-cultural theories, tools provided in computer-mediated communication (CMC) environments have long been considered able to create an environment that shares many communicative features with face-to-face communication. Over the past two decades, researchers have employed a variety of strategies to examine the asserted advantages and possible limitations of learning a second language in such a computer mediated environment. Despite its seeming appeal to language educators, the literature on the effectiveness of CMC in SLA is unable to conclusively support its benefits. This meta-analysis aims to systematically synthesize findings from (quasi-) experimental studies conducted between 2000-2012 to examine whether there was a link between the use of CMC and second language acquisition (SLA). Results from 59 primary studies show a positive and medium effect from CMC interventions. Additionally, communication taking place either asynchronously or synchronously does not seem to have a differential effect on SLA. Furthermore, learners&apos; proficiency level, interlocutor type, research context and task type were found to be variables that would significantly moderate the effectiveness of interaction in such an environment. The above results, however, were interpreted as tentative due to the small n-size of some categories of variables under comparison.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effect of using computer-mediated corrective feedback on EFL learners&apos; performance in writing. Sixty-four intermediate-level learners were randomly assigned to either a no-feedback control condition or a corrective feedback, including three treatment conditions. The first is the &quot;track changes&quot; feature of &quot;Microsoft Word 2010&quot; which double strikes through deletions and marks insertions in a different color. The second is recast feedback while the third is metalinguistic feedback. Over the course of eight weeks, each student was required to provide corrective feedback on drafts written by another group member and to discuss it with the group members. The study yielded three major findings. First, students who received computer-mediated corrective feedback while writing achieved better results in their overall test scores than students in the control condition who did not receive feedback. Second, there was a significant effect for the track changes made in the corrective-feedback type when compared with that made in the recast and metalinguistic feedback types. Students in the recast treatment condition also obtained higher significant mean scores than those who received metalinguistic corrective feedback. The study concluded with suggestions for further research and pedagogical implications.",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "There has been a substantial increase in recent years in the interest in using digital games for language learning. This coincides with the explosive growth in multiplayer online gaming and with the proliferation of mobile games for smart phones. It also reflects the growing recognition among educators of the importance of extramural, informal learning and the interest in finding ways to connect learning to students&apos; real lives. Given the important role that gaming currently plays in the everyday lives of adolescents and young adults in developed countries, this spike in interest is not surprising. However, there are a number of practical and pedagogical obstacles in the way of incorporating gaming into instructed language learning. Among those issues are: what kind of games to choose or to create; how to find the opportunities for language learning within gameplay; and how to integrate gameplay and its associated activities into the curriculum. In order to address these issues, we need research-generated data, which is crucial not only for learning how to make gaming more effective in classroom practice, but also in informing future game development. Collecting, analyzing, and sharing data collected from digital games is a major challenge, but some recent technical developments may present new opportunities. This column will not provide answers to the complex set of issues raised in the integration of gaming into language learning, but will identify and discuss some recent developments and point to possible future directions.",

    "description": "This paper reports on a study into the effects of digital game play on learners' Willingness to Communicate (WTC), or individuals' &quot;readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons, using a L2&quot; (MacIntyre, D\u00f6rnyei, Cl\u00e9ment, &amp; Noels, 1998, p. 547). Thirty Thai learners of English as a foreign language enrolled in a University language course completed six 90-minute lessons playing Ragnarok Online, a popular online role-playing game. The game had been installed on a private server and was thus only available to participants in the study. We modified the game to include special instructions, or quests (missions that players are assigned to accomplish in order to get items and progress throughout the game), designed to encourage collaboration and communication. To gauge participants' WTC, a series of questionnaires was designed, adapted from MacIntyre et al's (2001) WTC scale and previous studies on language and communication anxiety (Horwitz, Horwitz, &amp; Cope, 1986; McCroskey &amp; Richmond, 1982) and perceived competence (Compton, 2004; MacIntyre &amp; Charos, 1996). These asked respondents about their (own perceptions of their) willingness to use English, as well as their confidence, anxiety, and perceived communicative competence in communicating in English. The questionnaires were administered at the start of the course, and again after six gaming sessions. Results on the first set of questionnaires showed that students had low confidence, high anxiety, low perceived competence, and low WTC. The second set of results showed a marked and significant improvement, with participants feeling more confident, less anxious, more competent, and more willing to communicate. We argue that the careful construction of tasks that draw on the affordances of games can have a positive effect on the language learning process.",

    "title": "Can a Web-Based Course Improve Communicative Competence of Foreign-Born Nurses?",
    "author": "Van Schaik, Eileen, Lynch, Emily M., Stoner, Susan A., Sikorski, Lorna D.",
    "description": "In the years since World War II, the United States has grown increasingly dependent on foreign-born healthcare personnel at all levels of the healthcare system. Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction. While some may argue that the ICW cannot take the place of face-to-face interactions in a well-designed and executed ESL course, the e-learning environment offers several advantages: it is self-paced, private (thus less threatening), and provides continuous opportunities for practice and reinforcement.",

    "description": "Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) has existed now for nearly two decades with its application to foreign language instruction chronicled in some 340 implementation studies. For several years already, proponents have claimed that MALL is commonplace in foreign language instruction. In reality, with few exceptions, published studies of MALL implementations have not progressed much beyond pilot testing, i.e., design proposals, proof of concepts, limited experiments, class trials. Above all, what is most striking about published MALL implementation studies is the virtual lack of follow-up reports of curricular integration. In order to put MALL applications into perspective, this paper is organized into three sections. The first gives an overview of published MALL implementation studies, the second provides a comparative analysis of MALL applications, and the last addresses the issue of MALL curricular integration. On the basis of this review, the paper concludes that MALL remains marginal in terms of the number of students and courses involved, the duration of implementations, the language skills targeted, the kinds of learning activities undertaken and the methodological approach used. Nonetheless, it also maintains that the necessary technological base and pedagogical expertise are in place to bring MALL in from the fringes to the core of foreign language teaching.",

    "description": "This quasi-experimental study examined whether there was any difference in the quantity and quality of the written texts produced by two groups (N = 18) of intermediate Chinese language learners. Over one semester, students in the experimental (E) group wrote weekly updates and comments in Chinese on a designated Facebook group page, while students in the control (C) group did not post on the Facebook page. Three writing tasks were administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Results of a non-parametric statistical test revealed that there was a significant difference in writing quantity between the two groups. Specifically, while there was no significant difference between the two groups in the first writing task, the E group produced significantly more Chinese characters than the C group in the later writing tasks. However, in terms of the writing quality, results of a Mann-Whitney Test showed no significant differences between the two groups in all three writing tasks. As the small sample size may have had some impact on the study's outcome with respect to the quality of students' writing, the results are more promising in the area of quantity. These results indicate that Facebook could be used as an alternative pedagogical space for L2 literacy practice outside of class, with the potential for helping L2 learners improve at least some aspects of their writing performance.",

Student teachers&apos; (STs) initial beliefs should be challenged and reconstructed by taking into account particular teaching contexts. This study investigated the advantages of conducting online activities with L2 learners in L2TE. Using the genetic (Vygotsky, 1981) and activity theory (Leontiev, 1981) frameworks, this study addressed the following questions: (1) What contradictions emerge during online activities? and (2) How do the contradictions relate to STs&apos; identity development? STs in a Japanese language education program engaged in three wiki activities with learners from Japanese language classes abroad. Data were collected in the domains of the genetic framework and included the STs&apos; autobiographical statements, journals, final reflections, on-site peer dialogue, and observation notes. Contradictions between and within elements (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987) were identified and triangulated across the data sets. The data illustrated that the STs who initially relied on their native speaker authority gradually realized the socially and culturally complex roles required for L2 teachers. These findings suggest that online activities in L2TE provide opportunities for not only media literacy but also professional identity development.",

However, there is not sufficient evidence that learners can imitate some tongue animation. In this paper, we argue that although controlling tongue movement related to speech is not such an easy task, training with visual feedback improves its control. We investigated human awareness of controlling their tongue body gestures. In a first experiment, participants were asked to perform some tongue movements composed of two sets of gestures. This task was evaluated by observing ultrasound imaging of the tongue recorded during the experiment. No feedback was provided. In a second experiment, a short session of training was added where participants can observe ultrasound imaging in real time of their own tongue movements. The goal was to increase their awareness of their tongue gestures. A pretest and posttest were carried out without any feedback. The results suggest that without a priori knowledge, it is not easy to finely control tongue body gestures. The second experiment showed that we gained in performance after a short training session and this suggests that providing visual feedback, even a short one, improves tongue gesture awareness.",

These students strive to learn academically, but rarely actively speak Mandarin either inside or outside the classroom. This two-stage study evaluated the use of SL in improving their oral output. The focus of stage 1 was to confirm the potential of SL for promoting the oral output of overseas Chinese students in Mandarin language classes. Twenty overseas Chinese students learning Mandarin participated in this stage. In stage 2, 24 overseas Chinese students were taught 3 learning units in Mandarin in SL. Analysis of the results showed that learning Mandarin in an SL environment significantly increased the in-class oral output of those students. They also made significant improvements in oral performance and learning attitudes toward Mandarin.",

    "description": "Big Data Analytics is a topic fraught with both positive and negative potential. Big Data is defined not just by the amount of information involved but also its variety and complexity, as well as the speed with which it must be analyzed or delivered. The amount of data being produced is already incredibly great, and current developments suggest that this rate will only increase in the near future. Improved service should result as companies better understand their customers, but it is also possible that this data will create privacy problems. Thus, Big Data is important not only to students who hope to gain employment using these techniques and those who plan to use it for legitimate research, but also for everyone who will be living and working in the 21st Century.",

Qualitative video and audio analysis may be useful for psychology programs to more effectively and efficiently train students on IQ administration. Through use of Transana, video and audio footage and corresponding verbal and nonverbal transcripts of student-conducted IQ administrations can be coded and organized and later retrieved by any combination of codes, file or clip identifiers, or collections of clips and presented as a simultaneous, running display of video, audio, and corresponding transcripts that facilitates rich analysis and feedback.",

    "description": "Science education is criticized because it often fails to support problem-solving skills in students. Instead, the instructional methods primarily emphasize didactic models that fail to engage students and reveal how the material can be applied to solve real problems. To overcome these limitations, this study asked participants in a general ecology course to operate an advanced environmental instrumentation (GC/MS), collect pollution samples, complete data analysis, develop an environmental assessment, and proffer a remediation plan for a local river during an ill-structured task. Students were then given a novel task to assess their transfer skills. The study specifically examined student attitudes, effectiveness, and outcomes toward the integration of laboratories into a science course. Results found that students rated their level of instrumentation confidence as low, but showed statistically significant differences on transfer task scores.

    "description": "This study illustrates how a synergy of two technologies--Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) and corpus linguistic analysis--can produce a lasting improvement in L2 learners' ability to edit persistent grammatical errors from their writing. A large written English corpus produced by Korean undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at an American university was analyzed to determine four persistent grammatical errors in their writing assignments. An ICALL program was then designed to improve these L2 learners' awareness of these errors in texts and provide practice in correcting them. A pre-test/post-test experiment revealed a significant improvement in recognizing and correcting the four errors by Korean L2 learners who had taken the ICALL program over a matched control group that had received standard L2 writing instruction. This improvement held up on a second post-test administered five months later. The implications of the results for L2 instruction and the design of iterative ICALL tutors are discussed.",

    "description": "This study examines how three captioning types (i.e., on-screen text in the same language as the video) can assist L2 learners in the incidental acquisition of target vocabulary words and in the comprehension of L2 video. A sample of 133 Flemish undergraduate students watched three French clips twice. The control group (n = 32) watched the clips without captioning; the second group (n = 30) watched fully captioned clips; the third group (n = 34) watched keyword captioned clips; and the fourth group (n = 37) watched fully captioned clips with highlighted keywords. Prior to the learning session, participants completed a vocabulary size test. During the learning session, they completed three comprehension tests; four vocabulary tests measuring (a) form recognition, (b) meaning recognition, (c) meaning recall, and (d) clip association, which assessed whether participants associated words with the corresponding clip; and a final questionnaire. Our findings reveal that the captioning groups scored equally well on form recognition and clip association and significantly outperformed the control group. Only the keyword captioning and full captioning with highlighted keywords groups outperformed the control group on meaning recognition. Captioning did not affect comprehension nor meaning recall. Participants' vocabulary size correlated significantly with their comprehension scores as well as with their vocabulary test scores.",

    "description": "Although the concept of ubiquitous technologies has been introduced to many parts of society, there have been limited applications, and little is known about learners' behavior toward ubiquitous technologies, particularly in the context of English learning. This study considers a sample of Korean students to identify the key factors that influence English-language learners' (ELLs') satisfaction with ubiquitous learning (u-learning). The proposed model incorporates ubiquitous characteristics (omnipresence, context customization, interactivity, self-directed learning, and perceived enjoyment) as well as learner characteristics (innovation, learning motivation, and computer self-efficacy) and their impact on ELLs' satisfaction. In addition, the study assesses the effects of satisfaction on expectation in the context of English learning and employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the hypotheses. The results were based on a sample of 376 students using u-learning to study English and indicate that all the variables for ubiquitous characteristics and two variables for learner characteristics (innovation and computer self-efficacy) had significant effects on satisfaction with u-learning and that this satisfaction had a positive effect on expectation.",

    "description": "The Writing Pal (W-Pal) is an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) designed to provide students with explicit writing strategy instruction and practice. W-Pal includes a suite of educational games developed to increase writing engagement and provide opportunities to practice writing strategies. In this study, first (L1) (n = 26) and second (L2) language (n = 16) students interacted with W-Pal over eight sessions. We collected students' daily self-reports of engagement, motivation, and perceptions of performance, as well as their reported game attitudes (difficulty, helpfulness for learning, and enjoyment). Results indicated that, for all students, interactions with W-Pal led to increases in writing performance and more positive attitudes towards the system (engagement, motivation, and perceived performance). For L1 students, game difficulty was a significant predictor of boredom; however, for the L2 students, game enjoyment predicted both their motivation and perceived writing improvement. Notably, the L2 students' game ratings accounted for more variance in these daily reports than did the ratings of L1 students. This study suggests that L1 and L2 students experience similar benefits offered by game-based strategy practice in an ITS. Further, the link between game attitudes and overall daily perceptions of training may be stronger for L2 students than L1 students.",

    "title": "Testing Learner Reliance on Caption Supports in Second Language Listening Comprehension Multimedia Environments",
    "author": "Leveridge, Aubrey Neil, Yang, Jie Chi",
    "description": "Listening comprehension in a second language (L2) is a complex and particularly challenging task for learners. Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.",

    "author": "Sockett, Geoffrey",
    "description": "Research into the online informal learning of English has already shown it to be a widespread phenomenon involving a range of comprehension and production activities such as viewing original version television series, listening to music on demand and social networking with other English users. Dynamic systems theory provides a suitable framework within which to study informal learning because it emphasises the unique range of resources, strategies and relationships which contribute to non-linear language development for each learner. While research into the impact of these activities for language development has yielded some data regarding vocabulary gains and improvements in fluency and comprehension skills, the mechanisms at work in such language development have proved difficult to study because of the private nature of most online informal learning. In this study, an emic approach is adopted, involving a group of students experienced in second language acquisition research, who used blogs to report on their own online informal learning of English over a three-month period. Extensive examples from these blogs are used to build up a picture of the learning processes at work, within a framework suggested by the literature of complex dynamic systems. These results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the way in which these processes are used by informal learners in different phases of real communicative tasks.",

    "author": "Ryu, Dongwan",
    "description": "Many researchers have investigated learning through playing games. However, after playing games, players often go online to establish and participate in the online community where they enrich their game experiences, discuss game-related issues, and create fan-fictions, screenshots, or scenarios. Although these emerging activities are an essential part of gaming culture, they have not attracted much attention from researchers and only a few empirical studies have been done on learning through beyond-game culture. Language learning in particular has not been extensively researched despite the proliferation of game players who speak English as a foreign language within this community. To address how non-native English speaking (NNE) game players participate in language learning through game play and beyond-game culture, three generations of activity theories and a multiple-case study design were employed in this study. The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture. First, words or phrases used in game play could be learned while playing games. Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games. Third, these two types of engagement in gaming culture were closely related to influencing language learning through repeated practices and collaborative interactions. In conclusion, language learning through gaming is appropriately understood when ecological perspectives are adopted to look at both sides of gaming culture.",

    "author": "Sato, Takeshi, Matsunuma, Mitsuyasu, Suzuki, Akio",
    "description": "Our study aims to optimize a multimedia application for vocabulary learning for English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Our study is based on the concept that difficulty in reading a text in a second language is due to the need for more working memory for word decoding skills, although the working memory must also be used for text comprehension skills. This implies that the automatization of word decoding to free the working memory is indispensable. Therefore, developing a multimedia application for vocabulary learning with a time-control function, our study hypothesizes that vocabulary learning with this function brings about the automatization of word decoding or faster recall of the meanings, and, as a result of freeing more working memory, better comprehension of text. According to our research, multimedia application users not only retained more words and recalled their meanings more quickly but also obtained higher scores on reading comprehension tests that contained the words learned through the application. From this result, we conclude that multimedia vocabulary learning with a time-control function can automatize word decoding skills and therefore free more working memory, thereby leading to better comprehension of the text.",

A variety of data, including the electronically archived versions of the wiki pages, students' responses to retrospective surveys, and focused follow-up interviews were collected and analysed. The findings suggested that the nature of the learning tasks, students' constant communication and appreciation of different opinions, the difficulties they encountered when communicating asynchronously, and students' expectations toward English learning affected to what extent they were involved in the online collaboration.",

    "description": "With the aim of summarizing years of research comparing pedagogies for second/foreign language teaching supported with computer technology and pedagogy not-supported by computer technology, a meta-analysis was conducted of empirical research investigating language outcomes. Thirty-seven studies yielding 52 effect sizes were included, following a search of literature from 1970 to 2006 and screening of studies based on stated criteria. The differences in research designs required subdivision of studies, but overall results favored the technology-supported pedagogy, with a small, but positive and statistically significant effect size. Second/foreign language instruction supported by computer technology was found to be at least as effective as instruction without technology, and in studies using rigorous research designs the CALL groups outperformed the non-CALL groups. The analyses of instructional conditions, characteristics of participants, and conditions of the research design did not provide reliable results because of the small number of effect sizes representing each group. The meta-analysis results provide an empirically-based response to the questions of whether or not technology-supported pedagogies enhance language learning, and the process of conducting the meta-analysis pointed to areas in research methodology that would benefit from attention in future research.",

It considers authenticity as the result of a social negotiation process rather than an innate feature of a text, object, person, or activity. From this basis, it argues that authenticity claims play an important role in both second language acquisition (SLA) and CALL, being utilized to support the legitimacy of an approach or discipline more generally, as well as in defending a specific didactic design, especially with regard to transfer and motivation. The paper distinguishes between three domains of authenticity claims essential to CALL contexts: authenticity through language (linguistic authenticity), authenticity through origin (cultural authenticity), and authenticity through daily life experiences (functional authenticity). It points out problematic aspects of engaging in authenticity claims and argues that a reflexive stance might be useful in questioning the role of authenticity claims in CALL theory and practice.",

    "description": "Organizing and implementing telecollaboration projects in foreign language curricula is not an easy endeavour (Belz & Thorne, 2006; Guth & Helm, 2010), as pedagogical, organizational and technical issues have to be addressed before cross-cultural interaction sessions can be carried out (O'Dowd & Ritter, 2006; O'Dowd, 2011). These issues make many teaching practitioners reluctant to try to integrate telecollaboration in their teaching, as they are more aware of the burden such initiatives might impose than of the benefits they might have for language learners. Within the European project NIFLAR we have tried to study the added value that integrating synchronous collaboration projects through video-web communication or \"Second Life\" might have in language learning. The study presented in this paper measures the oral communicative growth of language students, who were allocated at random to one of three research conditions: (1) the VC experimental group carried out interactions with native peers through video-web communication; (2) the SL experimental group carried out the same tasks with native peers in \"Second Life\" and (3) the control group performed the tasks face to face with classroom peers and had no opportunity to interact with native experts. Communicative growth was measured by comparing oral pre- and post-tests across conditions. Results show significant differences, the experimental groups outperforming the control group.",

    "description": "This study designed and developed a web-based reading strategy training program and investigated students' use of its features and EFL teachers' and students' perceptions of the program. The recent proliferation of online reading materials has made information easily available to L2 readers; however, L2 readers' ability to deal with them requires the development of specific reading strategies. The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy. The program offers four types of reading strategy functions (Global, Problem-solving, Support, and Socio-affective) through 15 strategy buttons: Keyword, Preview, Prediction, Outline, Summary, Semantic Mapping, Pronunciation, Speed Reading, Dictionary, Translation, Grammar, Highlight, Notebook, Music Box, and My Questions. Forty college teachers and thirty-two EFL students in Taiwan were invited to use and evaluate this program. The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies. This connection suggests that teachers should provide more explicit training to encourage all students to use Global strategies for overall textual understanding.",

    "description": "This paper describes the multimodal pedagogical communication of two groups of online teachers; trainee tutors (second year students of the Master of Arts in Teaching French as a Foreign Language at the University Lumiere-Lyon 2) and experienced teachers based in different locations (France, Spain and Finland). They all taught French as a Foreign Language to a group of students from UC Berkeley in 2010. They participated in a project using a desktop videoconferencing platform (&quot;VISU&quot;) designed for delivering online courses. The study focuses on the webcam's effects on teaching and learning and tries to answer the following question: how does multimodal interaction affect interactive learning? Our hypothesis is that experienced teachers channel information through the webcam more efficiently and effectively in order to engage learners in knowledge construction. This paper presents the results of research based on an empirical method of collecting ecological data.",

    "title": "Developing a Framework for Using E-Portfolios as a Research and Assessment Tool",
    "author": "Shin, Sun-young",
    "description": "As Tarone (1998) stated, an understanding of interlanguage variation in relation to contextual changes has been a key issue in both second language acquisition (SLA) and language assessment (LA) research. Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored. In that vein, this article addresses a number of limitations of existing E-portfolios as a research and assessment tool, and offers recommendations and suggestions for future research.",

    "title": "Language Students and Their Technologies: Charting the Evolution 2006-2011",
    "author": "Steel, Caroline H., Levy, Mike",
    "description": "This paper has two key objectives. Firstly, it seeks to record the technologies in current use by learners of a range of languages at an Australian university in 2011. Data was collected via a large-scale survey of 587 foreign language students across ten languages at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011. The data reported in two studies, one by Conole (2008) and one by Peters, Weinberg and Sarma (2008) are used as points of reference for the comparison with the present study. The findings of the current study point to the autonomy and independence of the language learners in this cohort and the re-emergence of CALL tools, both for in-class and out-of-class learning activities. According to this data set, learners appear to have become more autonomous and independent and much more able to shape and resource their personal language learning experience in a blended learning setting. The students also demonstrate a measure of sophistication in their use of online tools, such that they are able to work around known limitations and constraints. In other words, the students have a keen awareness of the affordances of the technologies they are using.",

    "author": "Caws, Catherine G.",
    "description": "As shown by several studies, successful integration of technology in language learning requires a holistic approach in order to scientifically understand what learners do when working with web-based technology (cf. Raby, 2007). Additionally, a growing body of research in computer assisted language learning (CALL) evaluation, design and development, has indicated that analysis of learners' behaviours is an essential element to implementing high-quality technology (e.g., Chapelle, 2001; Levy & Stockwell, 2006). Hence, carefully evaluating the effectiveness of CALL by collecting empirical data on user interactions while focusing on the process of learning is integral to a holistic understanding of students' behaviours (e.g. Felix, 2005; Hemard, 2006). This article examines a design-based research that seeks to analyse and understand the dynamics of user interactions with a specific web-based CALL tool in the context of a French as a second language (FSL) course. To this end, we present a sample of results based on an analysis of specific tasks carried out with this CALL tool that is designed in part to encourage students' integration of critical and electronic literacies. By way of conclusion, we identify the steps that are necessary to enhance this particular CALL system and help users better achieve their learning goals. In particular, we explain the process of recycling our results in the next design phase of the CALL tool in a continuous improvement effort.",

    "author": "Geluso, Joe",
    "description": "Usage-based theories of language learning suggest that native speakers of a language are acutely aware of formulaic language due in large part to frequency effects. Corpora and data-driven learning can offer useful insights into frequent patterns of naturally occurring language to second/foreign language learners who, unlike native speakers, are not privy to a lifetime of input and fine-tuning. Recently, the use of the web in combination with the Google search engine as an accessible corpus and concordancer has received much attention. This article describes an experiment which tests the hypothesis that native speakers of English perceive learner-generated phrases to be more natural after learners have searched the phrases on Google and modified them in light of the frequency of search results. The findings indicate that native speakers perceive phrases that generated more results in Google searches to be more natural. (Contains 3 tables, 2 figures and 2 notes.)",

To enhance the learners' lexical repertoire and thereby improve their reading comprehension, an online corpus-based approach was integrated into 42 hours of reading comprehension classroom instruction. The results of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group on the posttest suggesting that the main effect of corpus integration has been significant.

    "description": "OpenCourseWare (OCW) has received increasing attention over the past few years in higher education. These courses provide appealing opportunities to view classes taught in well-established universities worldwide. The current study aims to examine how OCW lectures can serve as authentic learning materials to facilitate vocabulary acquisition for learners learning English as a foreign language (EFL). It further investigates factors that influence the effectiveness of vocabulary acquisition via OCW lectures. Three open-course lectures from MIT and Yale University, on psychology, physics, and music, were selected. Sixty-five Taiwanese college students participated in the study. The results of pre- and post-testing indicate that learners were able to gain L2 vocabulary knowledge by simply viewing an OCW lecture once. Level of vocabulary (academic vocabulary, technical vocabulary and low-frequency vocabulary) was found to be the most influential factor affecting vocabulary acquisition through OCW lectures. In addition, learners improved more on technical words than on academic ones. Verbal elaboration was also an important factor affecting vocabulary acquisition; the more explicit the elaboration is the greater the vocabulary gain. Frequency of occurrence, on the other hand, had positive but relatively small effects on learners' vocabulary gain. (Contains 14 tables.)",

    "author": "Vurdien, Ruby",
    "description": "Today Web 2.0 technologies, including blogs, are presenting both teachers and learners with new horizons in the field of language teaching and learning. A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html]. Hence, students use the basis of their worldviews to shape and interpret their own meanings in writing. Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

    "description": "Many computer-assisted language learning (CALL) studies have found that teacher direction can help learners develop language skills at their own pace on computers. However, many teachers still do not know how to provide support for students to use computers to reinforce the development of their language skills. Hence, more examples of CALL activities need to be offered to language teachers to help them use the computer in various teaching contexts. This article explores how teachers provide support to help students use CALL programs efficiently to improve their listening and speaking skills when learning English in pre-sessional courses in the higher education context. This discussion examines the perspective of both teachers and students through questionnaires, interviews and observations in the computer labs of two universities in the UK. The findings suggest several potential ways that teacher assistance may help students use computers more effectively for their language practice. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Unlike most applications of wikis to foreign/second language learning thus far reported on, ours concerns complete beginners. In this paper, we focus on our approach to and evaluation of the integration of wikis into our first-year Italian course with the aim of encouraging out-of-class practice and fostering students&apos; sense of class community, right from the start of their learning. The evaluation showed that, although the students created several attractive and interesting pages, they did not appreciate the wikis as much as we had hoped: there were technical hitches, many found collaboration dynamics challenging, and most developed little interest in participating in a cross-campus online group. Our data analysis found no relationship between the students&apos; perceptions of the wiki work and their gender, initial confidence or frequency of use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools. However, those who, on entering the course, placed greater importance on interaction with other students, and a sense of community in class, showed greater appreciation of the wiki experience. From these findings, we draw implications for improving our approach to integrating wiki work into our program.",

    "author": "Hwang, Wu-Yuin, Chen, Holly S. L.",
    "description": "It is beneficial for students to experience situational learning, especially for English as a foreign language (EFL) learning. Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts. (Contains 6 tables, 2 figures and 1 note.)",

However, the results showed that EAP instructors do not make use of any types of Internet-based activities in their classes. Moreover, the majority of limitations in using the Internet in EAP courses were identified. It is concluded that undergraduate students of CE need training in various Internet-based skills.

    "description": "This study presents an efficient approach to personalized mispronunciation detection of Taiwanese-accented English. The main goal of this study was to detect frequently occurring mispronunciation patterns of Taiwanese-accented English instead of scoring English pronunciations directly. The proposed approach quickly identifies personalized mispronunciations of students, enabling English teachers to spend more time on teaching or rectifying student pronunciations. In this approach, an unsupervised model adaptation method was performed on the universal acoustic models to recognize the speech of a specific speaker with mispronunciations and a Taiwanese accent. A dynamic sentence selection algorithm that considers the mutual information of the related mispronunciations is proposed to select a sentence containing the most undetected mispronunciations to quickly detect personalized mispronunciations. The experimental results show that the proposed unsupervised adaptation approach obtains an accuracy improvement of approximately 2.1% in the recognition of Taiwanese-accented English speech.",

The study compared two groups of participants' performance, namely the treatment group which received both the system feedback and teacher feedback (i.e., blended learning mode), and the control group which received teacher feedback only. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Hong Kong in the form of an extra-curricular activity after school. Fifty-three students from the ages of 16 to 17 with different argumentative writing experience participated in a series of five writing workshops once a month voluntarily. The participants were assigned to a treatment and a control group based on the stratification approach. Their scores were compared and an interview with the treatment group was conducted. Analysing the total and content and organisation scores of the two groups, it was found that both groups demonstrated statistical significant gains. Nevertheless, the treatment group's gain appears to be more meaningful than the control group's in view of its group composition. The blended learning mode contributes to the encouraging results as revealed through the treatment group's scores, high rating and positive comments on both system and teacher feedback in the survey and interviews. The analysis also implies the need to improve the system feedback on paragraph coherence, workshop design and grading criteria. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures and 6 notes.)",

The CALL software &quot;package&quot; consisted of tools to facilitate the writing, reading and practising of kanji characters in context. A pre-design questionnaire was analysed to determine what students perceived would be effective software tools for kanji learning. This was followed by a written process tracing protocol to ascertain if the CALL tools, created by the author and the technology designer were effective in meeting students' needs. Based on a detailed analysis of students' responses in the first two stages, changes were made to the CALL tools interface and the learning environment. The final stage of student input was a post-design evaluation completed by a further cohort of students, focusing on whether the data collected previously had produced changes that were transferable and could effectively meet the learning needs of different groups of students. All three stages of input produced different data of importance to the final design. Mid-design input was the most detailed and transferable design elements could be extracted. My recommendation is that end-users of CALL tools be consulted throughout the design process.",

Nine college students from a Chinese university participated in the wiki-mediated collaborative writing project. Analyses of data from the wiki &quot;Discussion&quot;, &quot;Page&quot;, and &quot;History&quot; modules on each group tab revealed that the three small groups displayed three distinct patterns of online interaction: collectively contributing/mutually supportive, authoritative/responsive, and dominant/withdrawn. These patterns were substantiated by the roles group members assumed and members' task approaches in terms of equality and mutuality. Also, findings from semi-structured interviews suggested that the different patterns of interaction influenced the students' perceived learning experiences. The collectively contributing/mutually supportive group reported the most learning opportunities. This study not only fills a gap in current collaborative writing literature but also makes a theoretical contribution to research on computer-mediated interaction in collaborative learning. Pedagogical implications on how to conduct computer-mediated collaborative writing are also addressed. (Contains 4 tables and 8 notes.)",

    "description": "In this study a self-paced instructional method based on the use of Apple's iPod Touch personal mobile devices to deliver content was compared with a group-oriented instructional method of content delivery in terms of learner acquisition of course material. One hundred and twenty-two first-year Japanese university students in four classes were used in the study. The subjects were placed in two experimental groups and two control groups, and each researcher taught one control and one experimental group. An independent samples t-test performed on the groups' placement scores on the university's English entrance examination showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of general English ability at the outset of the experiment. During the treatment sessions the control groups studied in a group-oriented classroom environment while the experimental groups studied the same course material but did so with a self-paced method that used Apple's iPod Touch personal mobile devices. As such, the subjects in the experimental group were allowed to study at a rate they chose rather than having the timing of the language input controlled by the teacher. The curriculum for both the control and experimental groups was based on the course textbook (&quot;Science English: Communication skills for scientists and engineers&quot;, Daniels, 2007, Tokyo: Thomson). The same standardized tests were given to all students involved in the study and the scores of the control and experimental groups were analysed using independent samples t-tests supported by Mann-Whitney tests.

Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology. &quot;MIS Quarterly&quot;, 13, 319-340; Rogers, E.M. (1983). &quot;Diffusion of innovations&quot; (3rd ed.). New York: The Free Press), it is essential to know users' attitudes and abilities before implementing widespread use of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) techniques in schools. This study takes a two-tiered approach. On the one hand, it aims to explore the current computer-related attitudes and abilities of Iranian high school language teachers and students, before the actual diffusion of computers into the education system. On the other hand, this study compares the attitudes of language teachers and students towards CALL, cultural perceptions of the role of computers in education, computer competence, and computer access. Toward this aim, a multi-section survey in the Persian language was administered to high school language teachers and students. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the results indicated that the majority of the participants have positive attitudes towards CALL and find it relevant to the cultural context of Iran. Teachers have moderate computer competence, while students have limited competence. Language teachers and students have daily access to computers mostly at home. The study further shows the difference between language teachers and students in that although teachers are presumed to be ambivalent about computer-related issues, in comparison with their students, teachers rank significantly higher on the CALL attitude and computer competence scales. From the positive CALL attitudes of both groups, it may be inferred that they will use computers in language education once computers become available, accompanied by adequate training.

    "description": "Although the enormous potential of the Internet has gained attention in Internet-assisted language teaching (IALT), a solid background of research is still lacking about/investigating English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' use of Internet assistive technologies. This study set out to determine Turkish university level EFL instructors' perceptions and perspectives on the use of the Internet for pedagogical purposes. A total of 486 instructors from 11 universities located in Turkey participated in a survey and responded to the questions about what type of resources they utilize on the Internet, how they perceive and use Internet-assisted language instruction, and how they assess themselves in terms of language learning technology. The findings reveal that although EFL instructors utilize the Internet densely and with a positive perception in their teaching, the quality of that utilization varies and needs to be improved via professional development programs for Internet-assisted language instruction. Suggestions were made for further research.",

    "description": "Digital tools are not always used in the manner their designers had in mind. Therefore, it is not enough to assume that learning through CALL tools occurs in intended ways, if at all. We have studied the use of an enhanced word processor for writing essays in Swedish as a second language. The word processor contained natural language processing technology to display linguistic information such as part of speech while students wrote their texts. We investigated how students' real classroom activity when using the tool corresponded to that which was planned by their teacher. Our contribution is on two levels: (1) a real-world analysis of occasionally problematic technology and (2) an elaboration on research methodology for conducting classroom studies within the sociocultural perspective. Our findings show that use of the tool varied greatly between sessions and that paying close attention to the near-future proficiencies of students is paramount. It is therefore important to account for novelty effects in CALL and to provide guidance to teachers concerning the use of such tools in their pedagogical context. We also suggest further elaborations of sociocultural theory and method in order to capture learners' classroom activities.",

    "description": "Over recent years, educational institutions have been making increasing use of virtual environments to set up collaborative activities for learners. While it is recognized that teachers play an important role in facilitating learner collaboration online, they may not have the necessary skills to do so successfully. Thus, a small-scale professional development programme was set up and piloted by two distance universities. The aims were to develop teachers' experience of online group work, to trial a set of pilot activities that would raise awareness of factors contributing to successful collaborative online activity, and to identify professional development needs in this area. This article reports on the hands-on experience of a group of 20 teachers, examines some of the competences that are needed to successfully collaborate in virtual environments, and presents the skills that teachers need to foster online collaborative learning in the virtual classroom. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, examining the levels of participation among participants, the collaborative activity of two groups, and teachers' perception of the collaboration that took place. The skills identified include planning and managing the collaboration, designing appropriate activities, giving clear instructions and getting students to negotiate ground rules for participation, moderating at the right level, and choosing the right environment and the appropriate tool(s). While this study was carried out with language teachers, many of the findings are applicable to other subject areas where growing emphasis is placed on the development of collaborative skills.",

Although a growing body of evidence suggests that serious games and VLEs could be advantageous and beneficial as instructional tools, research focused on their role in educational settings still lacks a unified approach to evaluating these interventions. To address this gap, the article provides an overview of current challenges associated with assessing the effectiveness of serious games and VLEs. In addition, the results from two projects provide lessons learned, and are intended to guide future efforts in developing and evaluating similar educational technologies.",

    "description": "Conducting an iterative usability testing, a set of prompts used as a form of instructional support was developed in order to facilitate the comprehension of the diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers, 2003) in a simulation game called the Diffusion Simulation Game (DSG) (Molenda &amp; Rice, 1979). The six subjects who participated in the study stated that the prompts were necessary in order to properly complete the game and that they would have done worse without them. However, the game performance and learning test scores did not correspond to the notion that the prompts significantly enhanced the learners' performances in the DSG or increased their knowledge of the underlying game theory. We assume that, as the DSG is a complex strategy game, the prompts may not be sufficient support by which to help learners. As such, it is possible that the game requires a different type of instructional support. We further speculate upon potential factors that could have affected the subjects' learning and performances. Several suggestions in regard to methods that could be used to improve the learning effectiveness of the game have been proposed.",

    "description": "Exploring the Solar System in the elementary school curriculum has traditionally involved activities, such as building scale models, to help students visualize the vastness of space and the relative size of the planets and their orbits. Today, numerous websites provide a wealth of information about the sun and the planets, combining text, photos, and graphics, and even interactive models. Some sites also include lesson plans and suggested classroom activities. Yet none of these resources allow for development of a lesson plan interactively, or offer tracking of student performance. Many lesson plans also have materials or space requirements that are impractical for some schools. SpaceSafari is an interactive multimedia software program for learning about the solar system that integrates information, exploration, and instruction. It employs a real-time 3D space for navigation, a module for learning about the planets, and an administrative interface for creating activities and tracking student progress. The design of the software resembles a first-person adventure game: a treasure hunt through the solar system in which the missions are created by the teacher. SpaceSafari was developed for both the formal (classroom) and informal (home) learning spaces, with a choice of input modes and display options. This integrated solution for teaching elementary Astronomy using personal computers poses an intriguing research question: &quot;What is the impact of game mechanics, combined with an immersive, kinesthetic, 3D interface, on learning outcomes about the solar system?&quot; (Contains 3 figures.)",

The emergence of instructional models which place greater emphasis on core skill development in science education help to build interdisciplinary communities through curricular connectivity and complementary contextual learning applications. Herein we report on an interconnected core concept and skills approach combining the blended structured use of the Learning Management System (LMS) with a core curricular context for biology and chemistry content. This hybrid was applied to the entry chemistry course for science majors. The threefold interconnected biology-chemistry core concept umbrella areas are Chemical Identity/Matter Classification, the Mole Concept, and Energy. A web-facilitated pedagogy was utilized for the complementary entry-level biological science course. The results provide preliminary evidence of the potential of this instructional approach as a means to both build interdisciplinary community in STEM education and innovate instruction for improved learning outcomes.",

    "author": "Wozniak, Nancy McCoy",
    "description": "Reflection plays a critical role in moving learning to the next level of inquiry. Stony Brook University has adopted an approach to using ePortfolios within the curriculum that emphasizes reflection. Stony Brook University successfully piloted ePortfolios in the Fall 2010 Semester and discovered their use facilitated the inquiry process for the students. Integrative ePortfolios have been used successfully over the past 3 years in colleges and programs such as Writing and Rhetoric, Engineering, Business, Leadership and Service, and Technology Systems Management. Within these programs, the process of inquiry takes center stage as educators embrace learner-centered course delivery and curriculum design in which the student is an active participant in the instruction. The learner-centered educator partners with the students, encouraging them to continue their quest for discovery while building knowledge connections to the next levels of learning. This inquiry process is the foundation for high impact learning practices such as 1st-year experiences, learning communities, capstone projects, internships, and service learning that research has shown to increase student engagement and retention. The main outcome for learner-centered instruction is to engage students in the inquiry process and integrate their learning in all areas of their lives. The inquiry process and integrative learning need to become a habit of thought and connection that ignites learning and the construction of knowledge throughout a lifetime. The Lifelong ePortfolio Process is becoming a recognized method to facilitate inquiry, evidence-based reflection, and integrative learning. This process helps the student to connect learning with knowledge and develop the habit of lifelong learning.",

The study analyzes alternative factor structures underlying a recently developed instrument (Tragant and Victori, 2012) and it includes the age factor in the examination of its construct validity. The target population consists of middle- and upper-grade learners of English distributed in two samples (n[subscript 1] = 550 and n[subscript 2] = 1425). Exploratory factor analysis and item analysis were initially conducted to be followed by confirmatory factor analyses and multiple-groups factor analysis. The instrument is a 55-item questionnaire based on a 6-point Likert-type scale measuring students' reported frequency of strategy use. Results support a correlated two-factor structure with a shortened scale of 17 items reflecting \"skills-based deep processing strategies\" and \"language study strategies,\" offering empirical evidence for the distinction between deep and surface clusters of strategies. Multiple-groups factor analysis showed that this model held for both middle- and upper-grade students, and upper-grade students were more likely to use the more advanced skills-based deep processing strategies and less inclined to use language study strategies than middle-grade students. The brevity of the scale and parsimonious factor structure enhance the questionnaire's utility for research and classroom evaluation. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

    "description": "With the advent of web 2.0 and virtual technologies and new understandings about learning within a global, networked environment, online course design has moved beyond the constraints of text readings, papers, and discussion boards. This next generation of online courses needs to dynamically and actively integrate the wide-ranging distribution of content knowledge: network learners, in new ways, while still addressing their unique qualities, assess the process as well as the products of learning and assimilate the rapidly-emerging technologies that are expanding communication and sharing. The acceleration of change in the communication process is requiring a flexibility in the course development process but also in the \"attitude\" of the instructor. Instructors must be open to new conceptions of learning and evidence of learning and must be willing to embrace challenge and uncertainty while establishing ongoing development, evaluation, and research goals. This article provides plentiful examples of ways that growth in online and technology-mediated environments can generate high levels of knowledge, learning, and engagement, and can allow for the open development of new learning resources.

    "description": "Research suggests that a host of cognitive, affective, and perceptual variables are at work when individuals go about the task of second or foreign language learning. Among these variables are learning styles that are habitual ways of perceiving, processing, and storing information. This study was conducted as a response to Isemonger and Sheppard's (2003) call for more context-specific research into the relationship between learning styles and background variables due to the inconsistencies existing in the field. The study aimed at exploring the pattern of graduate learners' perceptual learning style preferences and its possible relationship with their gender, age, discipline, and self-rated proficiency level. The participants were 138 graduate students at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran. They were randomly selected based on a two-stage sampling procedure and responded to the &quot;Perceptual Learning Style Preference Questionnaire&quot;. The questionnaire was translated, piloted, and slightly modified before the study proper. The results revealed that the participants favored kinesthetic and tactile modalities and disfavored group learning style. As for the background variables, some significant differences were detected. The findings and their implications are also discussed. (Contains 8 tables.)",

    "description": "This meta-analytic review was performed to determine the relationship between gender and two constructs measuring success in distance learning--academic performance and self-efficacy--with a particular interest in identifying whether females or males have an advantage in distance learning environments. Data from 15 studies resulted in 18 effect sizes for aggregation and comparison, with 9 of those effect sizes attributed to academic performance and 9 attributed to measures of self-efficacy. The aggregate effect sizes for both academic performance and self-efficacy were found to be significant (d = 0.36, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.25-0.46, p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.22, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -0.04-0.41, p &lt; 0.05), and were small or small-to-medium, respectively. The effect sizes for academic performance were not significantly heterogeneous, but the effect sizes for self-efficacy were. Exploratory moderator analyses indicated that the combination mode of learning with both online contact and face-to-face interaction moderated the effect of gender on self-efficacy, and also indicated a significant relationship between self-efficacy and participants in Asia versus Europe and the United States. These significant relationships were only apparent in a fixed-effects model. The study discusses the implications of the results, as well as the limitations.",

    "description": "The study on which this article is based investigated reasons for learning a foreign language at university in a predominantly English-speaking environment (the UK). It examined the relative importance of motivational variables as theorised in the field of second language (L2) motivation, and the effect of first language (L1) and linguistic background (English only versus other), country of birth (the UK versus other), choice of target language (French versus Spanish) and centre of study (specialist language department versus language centre). Despite the &quot;monoglot culture&quot; that prevails in many English-speaking countries, having an English-only profile and especially being born in the UK proved to be important motivating factors in the participants' decision to learn a foreign language. Few significant differences were found between learners of French and Spanish, which were both deemed to have continued instrumental value despite the dominance of English in the world today. The notion of ideal L2 self proved potentially more useful than traditional motivational constructs. However, it is argued that the concept would benefit from further research in particular amongst non-specialist language learners, who appear to have been largely neglected by L2 motivation theory to date, despite possibly representing the future of foreign language learning.

    "description": "While language learners and teachers have long known that individual differences (IDs) among students result in differential learning, we still do not know how traditional ID variables interact or the specific impact each one has on language learning. The present study proposes that instead of looking at isolated variables, researchers should instead take a top-down approach by starting at the level of students' overall experience of language learning. One way to investigate this is through language experience interviews, in which students are asked to reflect on general and specific aspects of their language experience. In the present study, language experience interviews were conducted with 12 beginning French learners at an American university, and six focal participants were selected based on their performance on spoken and written narrative tasks at the beginning and end of one semester. Qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed that high performing students seemed more focused on grammar learning and construction of meaning than low performing students, who were more focused on memorization and vocabulary. Case studies are presented to explore learner experience in more depth. Overall, the study provides support for language experience interviews as higher-level units that may relate individual differences to differential second language performance. (Contains 3 tables.)",

    "description": "The present study proposes a tripartite model of L2 reading strategy use, reading motivations, and general learner beliefs by examining the relationships among them in an L2 context. Reading strategy instruction was performed for 360 first-year university students enrolled in a reading-based course, in expectation of affecting their motivations and beliefs in the process. A tripartite model consisting of the three constructs was examined by structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed strong multiple correlations between these three variables. Furthermore, ample evidence was provided to validate this model: (1) the interdependence across the constructs demonstrated from the developmental perspective, (2) the model's multiple correlations confirmed at the level of individual correlations, and (3) the interrelationship between the constructs corroborated by the cross predictability in multiple regressions. The tripartite model suggests that the interdependence is a promising resource for comprehension development in the L2 reading context, and that main idea strategy plays a vital role in the process of learning to read. The results and discussion provide several important implications for research and instruction. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

Among the aspects of classroom management, in particular, classroom discipline seems to warrant research focus because it contributes to &quot;smooth and efficient teaching and learning in the lesson&quot; (Ur, 1996, p. 270). The current study examined Korean elementary school EFL teachers' language use for disciplinary purposes. Classroom interactions between two non-native English speaking EFL teachers and their respective students were observed in nine classes between March and June 2010, and audio-recorded. In addition, the teachers and students were interviewed in a semi-structured way. The results show that the teacher whose EFL proficiency level was high relied significantly more on the target language (TL) than on the first language (L1), while the low proficiency level teacher depended significantly more on L1 than on TL. The differences were found to be caused in complex ways by a number of factors. Based on the findings of the study, implications are suggested. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)",

Immediately before and after the respective interventions, the participants read a text, and two experienced judges rated in a blind and randomized rating task whether they could determine differences between the comprehensibility of the pre-test and post-test samples. The results show that ICF was more effective than listening only interventions in improving L2 comprehensibility.

Such programs have been found to have largely mixed results for language performance. This may be especially true of programs for teachers because task adequacy in teaching may not be shown by improved scores on traditional language performance measures. This study uses multiple complexity, accuracy and fluency measures to analyze transcripts of paired peer microteaching tasks at the beginning and end of a ten-week program. Analysis of the results shows that in general the teachers' language performances improved, but that there were complex interactions among the measures. In general the performance measures reflected task adequacy, but they may have been affected by nonlinguistic factors such as teaching aims. Although the study is limited because of its small size, it suggests that teacher language performances are complex and dynamic, and that even short-term programs with non-linguistic aims can have a positive effect on language performances.

The teachers kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences about increasing their proficiency in French. The final data set consisted of 273 pages of handwritten diary entries. Analysis of the data revealed five distinct beliefs and related corollaries about SLA. The number of diary entries that substantiated each belief ranged from 14 to 39, with between 42 percent and 63 percent of the teachers expressing each belief.

    "description": "Over the past several decades, the TESOL community has seen an increased interest in the use of data-driven learning (DDL) approaches. Most studies of DDL have focused on the acquisition of vocabulary items, including a wide range of information necessary for their correct usage. One type of vocabulary that has yet to be properly investigated has been linking adverbials. Linking adverbials serve to assist writers in giving cohesion to their texts. They are also difficult for second language writers to acquire, with many language learners misusing them semantically and stylistically. This study attempts to determine if DDL can assist students with this task. It investigates the correct semantic usage and proportion of academic linking adverbials in student writing both before and following treatment. Results indicate that DDL techniques do in fact help students acquire and better employ linking adverbials in their writing. Students receiving DDL instruction made greater improvements in their use of linking adverbials, both semantically and stylistically, compared to a group that received traditional linking adverbial instruction.",

    "description": "Recognizing how essential communication technologies have become to language learners, the TESOL Technology Standards Task Force set three goals for learners (Healey et al., 2011): 1) demonstrating skills in technology for a multilingual world, 2) using technology appropriately and ethically, and 3) using and evaluating technology for language learning. Nevertheless, despite the fact that social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook (FB), are perhaps the most frequently used communication technology, few, if any, studies have specified effective SNS L2 use as a learning objective. This paper aims to show how training L2 learners to use FB effectively can potentially help learners reach the three goals set by the Technology Standards Task Force. The article first examines previous studies on SNS usage among L2 learners before describing the author's action research study on the use of FB in a CALL-based English course at a Japanese university.

    "author": "Altman, Miriam, Meis, Alexandra",
    "description": "The American K-12 grade education system is experiencing a truancy crisis. Nationally, 15%, or 7.5 million students, miss an entire month of school annually [1], with that rate frequently doubling or even tripling among students from underserved communities [2]. Research has identified attendance as one of three primary indicators of high school graduation; in the United States today, nearly 35% of students will not earn a high school diploma within 4 years [3]. Ten states (CA, KY, MS, OR, IL, MO, TX, WA, ID, NC) specifically fund schools based on the Average daily Attendance model, through which schools are paid for the number of students in attendance everyday. In San Diego, where schools earn $29 per day for each student recorded &quot;present,&quot; the cost of absenteeism has amounted to $624 million over the last 5 years [4]. A Gates Foundation study found that 71% of recent dropouts believe the most effective way to have kept them and to keep their peers in school is to increase communication with families [5]. These research findings, coupled with the authors' teaching and parent advocacy experiences, have inspired Kinvolved, an organization dedicated to increasing K-12 attendance, particularly among underserved students, by implementing holistic solutions that integrate modern technology and human capital.",

    "description": "Numerous educational researches have showed that parental involvement in schools is highly correlated with higher student performance (Griffith, 1996; Jeynes, 2005, 2012; Sheldon, 2003; Stevenson &amp; Baker, 1987; Williams, &amp; Sanches, 2012). The research results are so evident that schools are now required by law to implement parental involvement provisions in order to receive certain federal funds, such as No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. With the rapid advancement in technology, strategies to increase parental involvement in education have been moving from print formats to digital formats. This article is to investigate whether the use of text messaging via cell phones to communicate between teachers and parents has measurable results on the academic performance of students. The study results show that on its own, the use of text messaging does not significantly change student performance; however, texting may have other benefits to teachers and students.",

    "description": "Using script-based tracking to gain insights into the way students learn or process language information can be traced as far back as to the 1980s. Nevertheless, researchers continue to face challenges in collecting and studying this type of data. The objective of this study is to propose data sharing through data repositories as a way to (a) ease the challenges that researchers face in collecting and studying this type of tracking data in non-CMC environments, (b) increase the use of this type of data to gain insights into second language learning, and (c) synthesize and enhance CALL research. To this end, the study outlines the functions of a potential data repository and reviews extant research studies. The review focuses on computer applications that used meaning aids to make the meaning of language items accessible during reading activities. The goal is to identify the required data fields for such repository by taking into account existing research studies. Finally, the study provides two potential research studies to exemplify how researchers can use the aggregated data from the repository to study research questions. Consequently, they may be able to draw stronger conclusions, thus enhancing the generalizability of CALL findings.",

    "description": "This paper reports the results of an action research-based study that adapted a mobile-supported cooperative reading system into regular English as a foreign language (EFL) classes at one Taiwanese elementary school. The current study was comprised of two stages: adaptation and evaluation. During the adaptation stage, a mobile-supported cooperative EFL reading (MCER) system--chosen because of a report about its effects on enhancing the development of young EFL learners' reading abilities (Lan, Sung, &amp; Chang, 2009)--was tailored to be integrated into a regular elementary EFL curriculum based on the suggestions of experienced elementary EFL teachers. During the evaluation stage, an EFL class learned reading via the support given by the MCER system; quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed to evaluate the effects of the adapted reading system on young EFL learners' reading abilities. The results revealed that the adaptation and use of the MCER system was successful and that it might facilitate the acquisition of reading abilities by young learners if used within EFL classes around the entire school.",

    "description": "Critical to maximizing the potential of technology for learning is enhancing language learners' self-directed use of technology for learning purposes. This study aimed to enhance our understanding of the determinants of self-directed technology use through the construction of a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework of factors and interactions that determine students' self-directed use of technology for language learning. A survey was conducted among second language learners at one university in Hong Kong to provide the basis for a model that describes how various psychological and sociocultural factors interact to influence language learners' use of technology for learning outside school. Attitudinal factors--such as &quot;language learning motivation,&quot; &quot;perceived usefulness of technology for learning,&quot; and &quot;perceived compatibility between technology use and learning expectancies&quot;--played a dominant role in shaping technology use. Perceived support from teachers and peers, self-regulation skills, and confidence in the selection and use of technology effectively impacted technology use mainly through strengthening perceived compatibility and usefulness. The findings suggest that attitudinal factors deserve much greater attention than currently given in promoting language learners' self-directed use of technology.",

    "author": "Lee, Hansol, Lee, Jang Ho",
    "description": "While mobile technology, such as the touch-based smart-phone, has become part of our daily lives, research into and classroom practices surrounding mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) have generally not kept up with the pace of technological development. This situation may be caused in part by the fact that a considerable proportion of researchers and teachers have not had personal experience with the newly developing technology. In order to improve this situation, the present paper provides comprehensible and useful directions for building web-based reading materials with integrated electronic glossing, with which readers can create their own web-based materials. The authors provide methodological descriptions and discussions of how to implement two useful formats of electronic glossing: (a) hyperlinks to target iframe and (b) tooltips by touching in web pages. The directions are carefully written so that these two formats of glossing work properly in both PC and mobile device environments. Lastly, the authors urge researchers and teachers to be more actively involved in the field of MALL and look forward to future work bridging the gap between computer-assisted language learning and mobile-assisted language learning.",

    "description": "As highlighted in the original call for papers for this special issue, learning with mobile technologies is currently a rapidly developing area of interest for researchers, teachers, materials writers and app developers in the educational field, not least within language education. Yet to what extent is this growing interest realised and shared by language learners themselves? How far are they motivated to exploit the affordances offered by mobile technologies for language learning, and how far can mobile technologies help to engage and sustain individual motivation for language learning? Although learner motivation is not a core concern of the studies in this special issue, a particular strength of these papers is their common focus on the student perspective in relation to mobile language learning. This student perspective sheds interesting critical light on the motivational dimension of mobile language learning, which is the thread this author addresses in this commentary article, building on her longstanding interest in motivation in language learning and more recently in relation to the use of digital technologies in language learning (see Ushioda, 2011). Drawing on the empirical findings reported in this special issue, she focuses this short commentary on the following motivational issues concerning mobile language learning: (1) Motivation as a matter of choice and autonomy; and (2) Motivation as a matter of personally meaningful casual learning.",

    "description": "Culture has long been seen as a fundamental component of language learning. While its importance is universally recognized, there is no consensus on what the term encompasses, how culture should be integrated into language instruction, or on what role technology can and should play in that process. In this column, we will be looking at the latter issue, at the ways in which technology can support teachers and learners as they seek to understand language through culture and culture through language. In particular, we will look at the growing interest in moving beyond traditional representations of culture in the classroom (i.e., the cultural products and traditions of the target language) to the concept of intercultural communication competence (ICC), defined by Alvino Fantini as &quot;the complex of abilities needed to perform effectively and appropriately when interacting with others who are linguistically and culturally different from oneself&quot; (2005, p. 1). In addition to looking at the most common approach to providing intercultural experience and learning to students--through telecollaboration--we will also look at new opportunities afforded by technological change. This will include some discussion of assessment options.",

    "description": "This paper explores the feasibility of an automated, online form of L2 strategy instruction (SI) as an alternative to conventional, classroom-based forms that rely primarily on teachers. Feasibility was evaluated by studying the effectiveness, both actual and perceived, of a five-week, online SI course designed to teach web-based dictionary skills integrated with knowledge of lexical patterns (involving grammatical collocation, complementation, and transitivity). Sixty-four learners in a US university ESL composition course were matched for vocabulary size and then randomly assigned to treatment and comparison groups in a learning management system. The SI treatment comprised multimedia presentations and a variety of practice activities with immediate, specific feedback, while the comparison condition involved recurrent use of dictionaries for referencing vocabulary usage features but no instruction. Performance data showed significant gains among the SI group in contrast to the comparison group, as well as a clear need for such training, while perception data indicated that participants felt the instruction was effective and relevant. The findings point to the as yet untapped potential of this form of instruction to address long-standing cost-benefit concerns about SI, as well as to help learners make more strategic use of CALL resources.",

Data sources included interviews, open-ended questions, course documents, and audio-visual products. Upon triangulation of these data, the following themes emerged as effective strategies in designing professional development programs: hands-on experience; convergence of technology, pedagogy, and content; discussion and reflection on pedagogy; and technology implementation into the classroom. These themes and strategies can aid in designing future effective professional development programs for language teachers, teacher educators, and school districts.

Pinpointing the differences between blended language (BL) learning environments and understanding how stakeholders experience such spaces is complex. However, learner experiences can provide a roadmap for the design and development of BL courses. Using a multiple case study approach, this paper reports on stakeholders&apos; experiences and comparisons of two different types of blended Spanish courses, one that harnesses ample technology and another that uses it much less. Using ethnographic data triangulation and systemic functional discourse analysis, four conflicting themes were constructed with respect to two types of BL courses and online versus face-to-face (f2f) classes. The first type of dilemma pertained to (a) the time commitments and (b) relationships developed in each course. The second type of dilemma surrounded the capacity of online and f2f classes for fostering (c) speaking skills development and (d) student understanding. Implications of these four conflicts of opinion for BL course developers, teachers, and researchers are discussed.",

    "description": "Online tools, such as forums, wikis, and blogs lend themselves to learners negotiating meaning and co-constructing knowledge through interaction. However, not enough is known about how tasks need to be designed to make best use of the possibilities of complex virtual learning environments (VLEs) to motivate and support learners, foster interaction, and contribute to knowledge construction. This article reports on a two-year study exploring the design and implementation cycle of online activities as an integral part of a distance language course. When the course was introduced in 2009, activities had been designed on the basis of second language acquisition principles as well as sociocultural theories, providing a basis for student interaction and taking into account the affordances of the environment, a Moodle-based VLE. After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners. Consequently, activities were re-designed and a number of changes were implemented in 2010 that included more teacher involvement, fewer tasks, a simpler structure, and a reduced number of tools. A comparison of learner participation across the two years shows that these changes had a positive impact on learner engagement.",

However, the training needs of students have not yet been fully acknowledged. This paper focuses on learner training as preparation for language classes where online synchronous conferencing is used. It presents an action research cycle consisting of planning and conducting training sessions, analysing evaluative feedback, reflecting on changing needs, re-designing the provision and re-iterating the sessions. The research focuses on three iterations of the learner training conducted over a 21-month period, drawing on almost 500 completed student feedback responses. The findings show that students considered the training sessions helpful in establishing how online language classes operate and gaining confidence to participate actively. Specifically they benefited from using their L1 to practice techniques for projecting their social presence in an online communicative situation, compensating for the lack of features such as body language, non-verbal communication, and spatial impressions. As for their teachers, the research demonstrated a need to reflect on the terminology used to explain CMC tools. The article concludes with good-practice recommendations for the provision of learner training in online language classrooms. (Contains 7 figures, 3 tables, and 1 note.)",

While students are familiar with posting pictures and videos online, they may not be aware of how to effectively integrate text and visual information to present their research in the online wiki format. Likewise, collaborative writing for an audience requires an understanding of authorship, how to productively collaborate on composing, revising, and editing, and how to interact \nsynchronously and asynchronously through online means to provide feedback. The framework we provide outlines how to scaffold wiki-based assignments to ensure an optimal language and culture learning experience. We developed this framework based on our reflections on the implementation of scaffolding procedures and a comprehensive review of the relevant research literature. The individual components of a wiki research project for intermediate language learners, selected grading rubrics, and a survey tool to assess student perception are provided. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Pragmatics research has also primarily focused on learners&apos; ability to produce native-like language forms, specifically speech acts, often elicited via discourse completion tasks (Jeon &amp; Kaya, 2006). To supplement such research, the present study used ethnography of communication (Saville-Troike, 2002) to examine whether and how 17 second-semester learners of German developed &quot;sociopragmatic&quot; competence by participating in computer-mediated communication. Based on the findings, some pragmatic &quot;targets&quot; are identified for different levels of instruction.",

    "author": "Lin, Wei-Chen, Huang, Hung-Tzu, Liou, Hsien-Chin",
    "description": "As various means of computer mediated communication (CMC) have been incorporated within language classrooms over the past two decades, it has become important to critically understand whether, to which extent, and under what contextual factors, a particular type of CMC is more effective than other modes of communication. This study examined the magnitude of the effect of text-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) on second language acquisition (SLA). By searching the studies published between 1990 and 2012, this meta-analysis explored 10 experimental and quasi-experimental journal articles and doctoral dissertations and reports their overall effect on SLA, and the contextual factors that influence the between-study variation. A small but positive overall effect (m = 0.33) indicates that text-based SCMC could make a larger difference on SLA than other means of communication. Findings further suggested that intermediate learners may benefit more from SCMC tasks if they are grouped into pairs or small groups and participate in SCMC interactions on a weekly basis. In terms of suggestions for future research, authors should provide more description about the SCMC task in order to confirm or disconfirm the factors that are associated with effectiveness of second language (L2) learning in technology-mediated language learning contexts.",

    "author": "Guilloteaux, Marie-Jose",
    "description": "Since Dornyei and Csizer's (1998) landmark study of the importance that Hungarian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers attached to a selection of motivational strategies and the frequency they reported using them in their classrooms, there have been few published attempts to examine the cross-cultural validity of their findings. The study reported in this paper builds on the work of Dornyei and colleagues (Dornyei and Csizer, 1998; Cheng and Dornyei, 2007). It uses Cheng and Dornyei's (2007) methods while changing the context to evaluate the relevance of a similar list of motivational strategies to 268 South Korean secondary school EFL teachers. The results provide further evidence that some strategies can transfer across contexts. However, unlike previous studies, it was found that Korean teachers attach very little importance and hardly ever use strategies related to generating a positive classroom climate and adaptive group dynamics. Furthermore, and unique to this study, virtually all the examined strategies were underused relative to their perceived importance, suggesting that motivating students is very low on Korean teachers' list of priorities.

    "author": "Wilsey, Biljana Belamaric",
    "description": "While much is known about the characteristics of adult learners and even adult learners in online and distance education settings, very little CALL research is focused on online self-instructed learners, and even fewer studies focus on learners of less commonly taught languages (LCTLs), such as Macedonian, for whom traditional or even distance education instruction may not be an option. Among this scarce research, there have been no studies that have described the characteristics of learners who opt to study LCTLs through self-instruction online. The present research begins to fill this void by investigating self-instructed learners using online resources for studying Macedonian. This study reports findings regarding the age, educational background, experience and level of comfort with learning languages online, which distinguish Macedonian self-instructed online learners from other learner populations studying foreign languages online. The primarily integrative reasons for studying Macedonian and the lack of other resources that force learners into choosing the online medium are also outlined. Knowing the characteristics of learners in self-instructed informal contexts, such as the one in this study, is necessary in order to be able to provide appropriate support and to design effective materials and resources to meet the needs of these and other learners of LCTL's.

    "author": "Vandergriff, Ilona",
    "description": "In their interactions with native speakers (NS), nonnative speakers (NNS) often position themselves as relative novices. For example, they may orient to the language expertise differential by apologizing for their linguistic ineptness or by making self-disparaging remarks about their second language (L2). This is true even for advanced learners in settings which foreground language learning (Hosoda, 2006). By and large, previous research on NNS/NS interaction has narrowly focused on instances where L2 ineptness interferes with mutual understanding. Widening the scope of analysis, this study considers such orientations more broadly, including those where perceived L2 shortcomings did &quot;not&quot; trigger miscommunication. Using extracts from a corpus of dyadic NNS/NS task-based interactions in quasi-synchronous CMC (SCMC), this study seeks to document ways in which advanced NNS participants position themselves and are positioned by NSs. The findings show that, as a group, these orientations to participants&apos; differential language competence do not primarily occur in (other-)repair sequences but rather elsewhere in the interaction. The data suggest that they serve a range of social functions, including (re-)indexing an L2 social self, building and maintaining social solidarity and intersubjectivity with the coparticipant, and ratifying the power of the native speaker (see Kramsch, 1998).",

    "description": "This article describes a new form of instruction called elegant instruction. Generally speaking, educational technologists assert that instruction ought to be effective and efficient. Some educational technologists might add that instruction should also satisfy learners. Incorporating the standard requirements and going beyond satisfaction, elegant instruction is effective, efficient, and inspiring. Elegant instruction arouses an appreciation for exceptional insight, creativity, economy, or beauty, which, combined with perceived applicability, inspires learners and compels them to greater achievement, to apply what they have learned, and to learn more. To ensure efficiency, elegant instruction is 60 minutes at most. Preliminary research into elegant instruction is encouraging; further research continues. After introducing elegant instruction and discussing its theoretical foundations, this article discusses two examples of elegant instruction for inspiring learners to use intriguing computer techniques. A third example seeks to convey the elegance--succinctness, applicability, and wonder--of mathematics. (Contains 1 table and 6 figures.)",

    "description": "This action research study evaluates the effectiveness of a CALL Learner Autonomy (CALL LA) course at a Japanese university. The &quot;C course&quot; blends face-to-face instruction and independent study in a CALL environment. It aims to enhance learners' autonomous use of CALL in the acquisition of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). In this study, three learning support aids were trialed: the Learner Passport, the e-Language Learning Portfolio and the e-Learner Self-Reflection Diary. The participant- researchers examined the course using data from the trial materials, observation, their own reflexive practice, learner questionnaires, interviews, artifacts and learner self-reflections. Findings indicate that teachers' and learners' consciousness was raised about what is expected of users in the autonomous use of CALL in a classroom environment and in a Self-Access Centre. The study also shows an improvement in learners' planning, organizing, tracking, and evaluation of their autonomous use of CALL resources, and that regular and critical learner self-reflection is a key factor\ncontributing to a positive shift in study culture. It recommends the conversion of the Learner Passport to an online, interactive format and the course-wide implementation of the three learning support aids as an incorporated package.

Using a pool of studies with much more statistical power and more accurate results, this meta-analysis demonstrates more precisely the degree to which CALL L1 glossing can be more effective than traditional L1 glossing. Results indicate, as previous research has shown, that CALL L1 glossing is significantly more effective in L2 reading comprehension than traditional L1 glossing. That is, the mean effect size is significantly higher (p less than 0.001) for studies that use CALL L1 glosses (g = 1.44) when compared to studies that use paper-based L1 glosses (g = 0.50). This article explains how and under what circumstances CALL L1 glosses may be more or less effective than traditional L1 glosses. (Contains 5 tables and 3 notes.)",

    "description": "This study explores the potential for automated indices related to speech delivery, language use, and topic development to model human judgments of TOEFL speaking proficiency in second language (L2) speech samples. For this study, 244 transcribed TOEFL speech samples taken from 244 L2 learners were analyzed using automated indices taken from Coh-Metrix, CPIDR, and LIWC. A stepwise linear regression was used to explain the variance in human judgments of independent speaking ability and overall speaking proficiency. Automated indices related to word type counts, causal cohesion, and lexical diversity predicted 52% of the variance in human ratings for the independent speech samples. Automated indices related to word type counts and word frequency predicted 61% of the variance of the human scores of overall speaking proficiency. These analyses demonstrate that, even in the absence of indices related to pronunciation and prosody (e.g., phonological accuracy, intonation, and stress), automated indices related to vocabulary size, causality, and word frequency can predict a significant amount of the variance in human ratings of speaking proficiency. These findings have important implications for understanding the construct of speaking proficiency and for the development of automatic scoring techniques.

The synchronous and asynchronous communication analysed was part of the MiLC Corpus, a multilingual learner corpus of texts written by language learners from different language backgrounds. The main research questions centred on the differences in the amount and types of errors found in both the synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication, and whether different L1 groups committed certain errors more than their counterparts from other mother tongue backgrounds. As we hypothesised, more errors were found in the synchronous mode of communication than in the asynchronous; however, when examining the exact types of errors, some categories were more frequent in the synchronous mode (the formal and grammatical errors, among others), while in the asynchronous, errors of style and lexis occurred more frequently. A analysis of the data revealed that the frequency of error types varied with each different L1 group participating in the simulation, this same analysis also showed that highly relevant associations could be established the participants' L1 and specific error types.",

It presents a profile of the iTunes U language learner, their listening habits, and their opinion of the resources they download. Comparisons are drawn between language learners and learners of other subjects. The results show that in contrast with profiles of learners in other contexts--such as virtual learning environment-delivered podcasts, identified in previous research (mostly carried out with young university students who download podcasts for instrumental reasons)--iTunes U language learners are different. Respondents in this study are mostly middle-aged and employed, and they download resources for personal interest. Users have a high opinion of the quality of the materials, and they believe the materials help them to learn. The results also show that users listen to language podcasts on mobile devices, in sharp contrast with previous research. Finally, the paper discusses implications for further research.",

From a sociocultural theoretical perspective, the current study investigated the language development outcomes and process in a 10-week Sino-American telecollaborative project involving 10 college-level American learners of Mandarin Chinese and their respective native Chinese partners from China. The findings show that the American learners' production quantity in Mandarin Chinese increased steadily throughout the project whereas the quality of their production didn't improve as rapidly. These learners also self-reported gains in age-appropriate cultural information, reading ability, and expanded vocabulary. The analysis shows the gains can be attributed to the scaffolding conditions (van Lier, 1996, 2004) that focused on friendship building and idea sharing in Mandarin Chinese and were specifically manifested in the operation of intersubjectivity, contingent help, and handover by both American learners and their Chinese partners throughout the project. Possible underlying reasons for the unbalanced focus on form versus on meaning in the project are discussed. Based on the findings, pedagogical suggestions are provided to enhance the learning conduciveness of email-based intercultural telecollaborative projects, particularly those involving participants from oriental cultures.",

    "description": "In this paper, we report on the development and implementation of a web-based mobile application, &quot;Grammar Clinic,&quot; for an ESL writing class. Drawing on insights from the interactionist approach to Second Language Acquisition (SLA), the Noticing Hypothesis, and mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), &quot;Grammar Clinic&quot; was designed as a series of outside-class grammar exercises in the format of sentence-level error identification and correction. 19 intermediate level ESL students at a large Midwestern American university used this mobile application in an English academic writing class during a 16-week semester. A mixed methods approach was chosen to investigate (a) the effect of &quot;Grammar Clinic&quot; on the efficacy of ESL students' self-editing as well as (b) their perceptions of this mobile application as a tool to improve their English writing. Our analyses show that students' performance on &quot;Grammar Clinic&quot; assignments reflects their progress in self-editing. This progress is seen in the positive correlation of the students' &quot;Grammar Clinic&quot; performance with their gains on a grammar post-test, an increase of self-editing corrections, and a reduction in errors in the final drafts of two major paper assignments. The impact of this web-based mobile application was documented using qualitative data that considered the students' use of and perception of &quot;Grammar Clinic.&quot;",

The learner-centered, task-based language learning approach using iPads facilitated interactions and provided scaffolded assistance. On average, students spent twenty-four minutes a week in video conversations on Face-Time alone. In addition, the required weekly recordings increased from a little over one minute at the beginning of the quarter to more than seven minutes for the last assignment.

Data from 87 high school students enrolled in a cyber-charter school Spanish II course in the Eastern United States included a pre- and post-cloze, a vocabulary recognition test, e-documents retrieved from the asynchronous discussions, and demographic information and motivation surveys. Results revealed that students who participated in the asynchronous discussions received significantly higher scores on the post-test than those who did not. In terms of level of participation, nonanonymous forums may have a comparative advantage over anonymous ones for learners with high levels of &quot;introjected&quot; regulation, whereas for learners with high levels of &quot;identified&quot; regulation, both forums are advantageous. &quot;Introjected&quot; regulation was the only significant predictor of success in learning L2 vocabulary.

A sample of 50 college students was grouped into the more- and less-proficient groups with 25 students in each. Results of this study reveal that the less-proficient students improved more during text revision than the more-proficient students did after the online feedback training on error correction. They were better able to detect and correct both local errors (i.e., grammatical) and global errors (i.e., text development, organization, and style) in their own and peers' texts. Their texts improved as a result of receiving immediate feedback and having the opportunity to explicitly observe how their more-proficient peers provided corrections and useful suggestions to peers and clarified writing problems for text improvement. The more-proficient students did not trust their peers' suggestions as much and made corrections mainly on local errors. These EFL college students' perceptions toward the effects of online feedback training on text revision were elaborated in this study.",

The resource delivers an automated, online form of strategy instruction outside of class time, facilitating self-paced learning with sufficient practice and feedback. In addition to the L2 lexicography, vocabulary, and strategy literatures, the project is informed by instructional design principles aimed at 1) managing demands on learners' cognitive processing capacities; 2) differentiating materials so as to appropriately target declarative or procedural forms of knowledge or the integration and coordination of the two; and 3) harnessing the computer's multimedia capabilities in principled ways. It seeks to address a number of related issues in second language studies including: the fact that pedagogical dictionaries go largely under-exploited and misused by their target audience; the apparent lack of understanding of collocational relationships among many L2 learners of English; the challenge of providing strategy instruction cost-effectively; and the need to facilitate more strategic and self-directed use of CALL resources.

In particular, this article focuses upon the hyper-collaborative participatory culture that has become ubiquitous across the Internet. This collaborative culture has transformed the frequency and manner of our communication with one another as well as the way we co-construct reality. The potential for incorporating the opportunities presented by this participatory culture into language teaching and learning is enormous, but we must recognize and avoid a variety of threats. This article addresses these realities while suggesting ways to promote collaborative autonomous language learning abilities. I discuss the potential for a pedagogical paradigm shift in response to this dramatically altered communication landscape and share some practical suggestions for classroom practice.",

This study examined one focal student&apos;s off-screen behaviors while she worked in front of the computer in her physical environment during a university-level synchronous Japanese class. The class was mediated by audio-based conferencing software (&quot;Wimba&quot;) where class participants&apos; behaviors in their physical environments were not observable to others. The primary data consist of two types of video recordings that were synchronized in a picture-in-picture format: the focal student&apos;s off-screen behaviors in her private environment and archived online classes with instructor and seven classmates (~20 hours). Drawing on conversation analysis, the study showed unique characteristics of interactional norms developed by the student in her physical environment in contrast to those observed in a controlled online environment. The focal student&apos;s off-screen behavior suggested that she gained significant affordances from the course format; namely, opportunities to freely take her private turns by vocalizing the language &quot;off-screen&quot; without being heard. The study illustrates the potential of computer-based learning to promote increased learner agency and autonomy.",

    "description": "This article will summarize and explain the Diffusion of Innovations Theory put forth by Everett M. Rogers (2003). It will then share some of the other research that has been conducted relevant to diffusion, especially those researchers who have looked at the diffusion of instructional technology in higher education. It will consider criticisms of diffusion theory and alternate ideas that have been proposed. Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovations Theory will then be considered in light of a specific example of instructional technology--the diffusion of ePortfolio use among faculty members at Stony Brook University. Consideration will be given to what has been done so far at Stony Brook University relevant to ePortfolio use, and how these steps compare to Diffusion of Innovations Theory. Recommendations will be made for moving forward with this technology and how to best encourage faculty members to try ePortfolios with their students. Finally, questions and gaps that might benefit from further research will be proposed.",

    "description": "Technology is becoming increasingly more important in the enhancement of educating university students. Very little research has been done regarding how the combination of educational technologies affects test scores, compared to the use of one technology alone. This research article examines whether the post-scores of nursing students increased by the type and combination of educational technology used in their instruction. By testing the use of various educational technologies and various combinations of these technologies on three different groups of learners, a pre- and post-test design was conducted to identify changes in post-test knowledge scores. Findings from this study suggest the use of combined educational technology may improve a student's ability to learn material as students in the group that used a combination of technologies scored higher on the knowledge post-test than the other groups studied.

Students in the course completed three questionnaires to provide feedback about their perceptions of the eTextbook and iPad. During the pilot program, students' perceptions of the usefulness, ease of use, and extent to which they enjoyed using the eTextbook increased. Students reported that the eTextbook made it easier for them to learn, and they preferred the eTextbook to a printed textbook. Students were neutral about the iPad's usefulness, but found it easy and enjoyable to use. Based on the students' feedback, it is recommended that an interactive eTextbook be used; that a course be redesigned to take advantage of eReader technology, especially if a tablet computer (iPad) is used; and that students be allowed to choose between an eTextbook and a printed textbook.

Even so, there is still no broad agreement about what a MOOC actually is. Although the current MOOC format(s) may not be a solution to our problems, they may be a symptom of the changing demand for higher education. Many of the students who take MOOCs are currently employed and wish to either learn new skills or solidify their current position. This suggests that colleges and universities need to develop new models for education that are more convenient and useful for today's potential students.",

    "description": "We report the development and initial evaluation of a serious game that, in conjunction with appropriately designed matching laboratory exercises, can be used to teach secure coding and Information Assurance (IA) concepts across a range of introductory computing courses. The IA Game is a role-playing serious game (RPG) in which the student travels through seven computer techno-inspired environments (IA concept rooms); in each environment he/she learns a different IA concept. After playing each level, the student completes a related CS educational module comprised of a theory lesson and a lab assignment. The game is being created with a user-centered iterative approach that includes two forms of evaluation: formative and summative. In this article we describe the design and development of the first four levels of the game, and report the findings of an initial formative evaluation of two game levels with a group of undergraduate students.

We examine both the feasibility and the limitations of developing English reading and grammar skills through the interface of mobile phones. Throughout the project, reading and grammar materials were regularly sent to students' mobile phones. Students read or took part in any aspect of the materials that appealed to them. Information gathered from participants and server logs indicate that reading and learning grammar using mobile devices is regarded as a positive language experience. However, the data also indicate that the success of any mobile learning project could be limited unless certain criteria are applied. This includes (a) providing engaging learning materials that are neither too long nor overly-demanding; (b) a proper degree of teacher monitoring; (c) student involvement; (d) the need for incentives; (e) a respect for privacy; and (f) a safe and secure mobile-learning technical environment.",

Those interested in MALL applications thus need to read widely to acquire an adequate perspective of MALL implementations. The intent of this bibliography is to facilitate this task by providing a comprehensive historical background of MALL applications from the first published work in 1994 to the end of 2012. To enhance the information contained in these references, over 90% of the entries are complemented by a brief (~80 word) summary. To the extent that the publication provides such information, each annotation identifies the country of origin of the study, native language (L1) and/or the second or foreign language (L2) involved, the mobile technology used, the learning area(s) targeted, the type of learners, their numbers, the duration of the study, and a summary of the results (i.e., learning outcomes and survey opinions). Since nearly 60% of MALL implementation studies appear outside of professional journals, in conference proceedings, project reports, academic dissertations, and so forth, locating copies of these publications poses a major challenge in itself. For this reason, where possible, links are included to copies of the works cited.",

We coded the frequency to which the competencies occurred in each announcement and summarized the results meaningfully in our article. Results suggest educational technologists must be competent in multiple areas, but especially in instructional design, project management, technical skills, and soft skills. Results provide compelling evidence that educational technology professionals must work with a wide variety of stakeholders in their work.

However, digital illiteracy and traditional views among school staff forced a regression from the game-oriented formal trial education in this study back to the traditional education form. Research questions were as follows: How did the pupils act upon the consequences of the regression? How can these acts inform the design of education in digital culture? These questions were addressed using ethnography over 3 years. The pupils' acts differed depending on their socialization in school and in games. While the game-oriented formal education included all in the socialization process, the regression caused half of the pupils to drop out. The pupils' acts are discussed with a conceptual framework. Conclusions show the need for digital literacy and understanding pupils' perspectives on education among school staff.",

Recent research indicates that business-related topics are a major focus of study on this emerging educational issue. Yet a systematic review of outcome studies regarding instructional Web 2.0 adaptations in business education has not appeared. To chart, the contemporary landscape of scholarly research in this area, the current study (a) identified, based on a keyword search in the &quot;ProQuest&quot; database, the key empirically based studies on the business education-social media nexus and (b) summarized the major findings of a subset of these studies (n?=?11) with a focus on views of business students and faculty. The main social media tools used in instruction were Facebook, blogs, Twitter, and YouTube. Although a majority of studies reported positive attitudes by students regarding academic applications of Web 2.0 technologies, faculty views were more tepid and reserved. Transgression of &quot;socializing&quot; during academic interactivity, privacy issues, and data overload were the major drawbacks noted by students. Faculty were most concerned about the vast breadth of social media modalities and the lack of training support in emerging interactive-mobile technology. Future research needs to address the views of business school administrators on educational adaptation of Web 2.0 tools.",

In writing, truly immediate feedback is impractical, but computer-assisted feedback provides a quick way of providing feedback that also reduces the teacher's workload. We explored the accuracy of feedback from Criterion\u00ae, a program developed by Educational Testing Service, and students' responses to it. Thirty-two students received feedback from Criterion on four essays throughout a semester, with 16 receiving the feedback immediately and 16 receiving it several days after writing their essays. Results indicated that 75% of the error codes were correct, but that Criterion missed many language errors. Students responded to the correct error codes 73% of the time and responded to more of the codes over the course of the semester, while the condition--delayed versus immediate--did not affect their response rates nor their accuracy on the first drafts. Although we cannot support claims that immediate feedback may be more helpful, we believe that, with proper training, Criterion can help students correct certain aspects of language.",

Three intact classes of fifth graders (N = 81 students; 27 per prewriting strategy group) participated in this study. These subjects in different classes used different prewriting strategies at the prewriting stage. A quasi-experimental design was adopted in this study to collect experimental data, including the scores of English composition (two writing works), the level of grammar knowledge, and the level of English writing motivation. The analytical results indicated that in both the mind mapping group and the drawing group, the participants' English grammar knowledge had increased significantly after the treatment. It was also found that different computer-supported cooperative prewriting strategies benefited young EFL writers in different dimensions of English composition. The influence of using the mind mapping strategy seems most powerful on young EFL writers, followed by the drawing strategy and the text-based brainstorming strategy. As to English composition motivation, almost all of the participants appreciated the computer-supported cooperative prewriting activities and were also aware of how these activities benefited their English writing.",

    "description": "This is the first paper that provides correlational evidence about how interacting with an online allophonic transcription tool helps learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) to improve their phonological awareness. The study investigates 55 advanced ESL learners at a Polish university enrolled in a course in English phonetics and phonology. The course placed heavy emphasis on reading and writing allophonic transcription based on the International Phonetic Alphabet. Apart from obligatory practice with traditional pen and paper worksheets, learners could also practise with a supplementary custom-designed web application that allowed them to enter the phonemic transcription of any word in order to receive its allophonic transcription. The results show that using this tool at least once during the course is associated with an expected increase in midterm test score of 5.03 percentage points, 95% CI [-10.61, 20.67]. The estimated benefit is higher for learners who space their usage of the tool; each additional distinct day of usage is associated with an additional increase in the expected midterm test score of 2.62 percentage points, 95% CI [-3.25, 8.49]. Additionally, some learners practised transcription on non-words, and these learners were observed to perform better on phonotactics-related assessment.",

Patterns in variation are identified across proficiency levels and between task types. Results show that all three measures increase at each proficiency score between Novice High and Advanced, except at Intermediate Mid where scores dip or flatten. Diversity and sophistication are both shown to increase rapidly after this mid-point, indicating that a broad and deep lexical repertoire is a key feature of more advanced proficiency levels. Results for the effect of task indicate that text genre impacts learners' lexical density, while tasks that are more complex elicit higher lexical sophistication.",

    "description": "This study investigates the interaction of native speaker--non-native speaker (NS-NNS) dyads engaged in conversational interaction as part of a video-based synchronous computer mediated communication (VidSCMC) eTandem language program. Previous work has indicated certain advantages of NNS-NS conversational interaction for language learning (e.g., Nakahama et al., 2001); however, this potential has not been tested empirically for interaction in voice-based synchronous computer mediated communication (SVCMC) platforms, despite their growing popularity among language learners (Yanguas &amp; Bergin, 2018). Participants were 18 university students (9 L1 English-L2 Spanish; 9 L1 Spanish-L2 English) taking part in a VidSCMC eTandem language partnership between two universities, in the United States and Mexico. Building on previous interactionist work on synchronous computer mediated communication (SCMC), language related episodes (LREs) were analyzed for quantity, trigger type, initiator, reactive or preemptive status, instances of negotiation, and the provision of negative feedback. Results show a remarkably even distribution of LRE types and linguistic foci, with NSs and NNSs taking equal responsibility in promoting globally- and locally-focused target language (TL) comprehension and output through their engagement in LREs. These patterns are reflective of the simultaneously shared status of learner and expert by the members of NS-NNS eTandem exchange dyads. Results are discussed in light of the changing relationship between language and language learners brought on by modern technologies.",

    "description": "Adopting the approaches of &quot;pattern hunting&quot; and &quot;pattern refining&quot; (Kennedy &amp; Miceli, 2001, 2010, 2017), this study investigates how seven freshman English students from Taiwan used the Corpus of Contemporary American English to discover collocation patterns for 30 near-synonymous change-of-state verbs and new ideas about the topic of &quot;change&quot; in the drafting stage of their essay writing. The study used a mixed-methods approach to examine the learning outcomes, learners' corpus use, and their perceptions of the process. Results were drawn by analyzing writings in three time frames (pre-test, post-test, delayed posttest), video files of corpus consultation, questionnaires, and stimulus recall-session interviews. The results showed that the learners successfully discovered and incorporated collocation patterns in change-of-state verbs and ideas about the topic of change into their essays, although some difficulties emerged. Their performance on change-of-state verbs improved, and this improvement remained three months after the treatment. The study also demonstrated learners' different perceptions and actualizations of the affordances offered by the corpus. While all learners used the corpus to correct collocation errors, they had diverse attitudes and uses of the corpus to address content ideas or collocation complexities in their writing. The study concludes by discussing the theoretical and pedagogical implications of the results.",

In the choice and use of learning materials and approaches, I argue for the consideration of current research in second language acquisition (SLA), with particular importance being studies on sociocultural/pragmatic and multilingual practices, the application of usage-based and complex dynamic models of language learning, and the evidence of the viability of informal language learning. Those developments inform an ecological approach to computer-assisted language learning (CALL), which stresses the openness and unpredictability of the process through the organic interplay between learner and environment. The column concludes with a plea for a greater role for second language development as a vital contribution to the development of global citizenry.",

    "description": "Drawing on past and current scholarship on digitally mediated communication in language learning, this review article examines the evolution of identity research in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) from the 1990s to the present day. The article offers an in-depth overview of critical issues and topics associated with language learner identification in educational digital settings and non-institutionally situated online cultures. A chronological approach is followed, addressing three main historical periods broadly related to the major conceptual shifts in applied linguistics: early developments and the communicative turn (1995-2000), the social and intercultural turns (2000-2010), and the critical and multilingual turns (2010-2020). Thus, this paper seeks to link the research on digital identity in CALL to second language acquisition (SLA) theories and highlight key studies and their importance for the field and the shifting paradigm. The article concludes with a summary of newly emerging themes in digital identity studies and outlines new directions for research on language learner identity in digital spaces. Singling out identity research within the discipline of CALL as a historically evolving topic that reflects the ever-changing realms of the digital world contributes to strengthening interdisciplinary ties between broadly conceptualized digital humanities, digital humanistic pedagogies, and computer-assisted language learning sciences.",

    "description": "The advance of educational technologies and digital devices have made computer-assisted language learning (CALL) an active interdisciplinary field with increasing research potential and topic diversity. Questions like &quot;what topics and technologies attract the interest of the CALL community?,&quot; &quot;how have these topics and technologies evolved?,&quot; and &quot;what is the future of CALL?&quot; are key to understanding where the CALL field has been and where it is going. To help answer these questions, the present review combined structural topic modeling, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and hierarchical clustering with bibliometrics to investigate the research status, trends, and prominent issues in CALL from 1,295 articles over the past 25 years ending in 2020. Major findings revealed that Social Sciences Citation Indexed journals such as Computer Assisted Language Learning, Language Learning &amp; Technology, and ReCALL contributed most to the field. Topics that drew the most interest included mobile-assisted language learning, project-based learning, and blended learning. Topics drawing increasing research interest include mobile-assisted language learning, seamless learning, wiki-based learning, and virtual world and virtual reality. Additionally, the development of mobile devices, games, and virtual worlds continuously promote research attention. Finally, the review showed that scholars and educators are integrating different technologies, such as the mixed use of mobile technology and glosses/annotations for vocabulary learning, and their application into various contexts; one such context being the integration of digital multimodal composing into blended project-based learning.",

    "description": "While research on language learner autonomy and Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is abundant, few studies have sought to systematically explore the relationship between the two. By adopting a rigorous approach that identifies transparent inclusion and exclusion criteria, this paper presents a systematic review that seeks to identify: (1) the scope of interest; (2) features; and (3) the trends that emerge at the intersection of the empirical research on learner autonomy and CALL. A dataset comprising of 41 research articles published over a span of 22 years was coded and quantified, with the data extracted, then compared over two distinct periods, 1997 to 2010 and 2011 to 2020. Results show that there is a significant increase in the number of participants targeted for studies, which are situated in non-formal and informal learning contexts with an unstructured degree of formality. Moreover, online applications, such as social media and downloadable apps, seem to be favored and can be directly linked to the ubiquitous autonomous learning experience through either mobile-assisted language learning or informal learning.",

    "description": "While fluency in second language speaking can be a challenging construct to measure, it is important to identify the discourse features that contribute to it. This small-scale classroom research project examined the effect of formulaic language sequences on fluency as measured by computer-based speaking tasks of young English learners. Thirty-six speech samples were collected as a part of standard instruction in grades 5-8 in a medium-sized public school district in the Southeastern US. The speech samples were analyzed using Praat speech analysis software to identify the mean length of fluent run for fluency and coded formulaic language sequences for discourse function. Findings indicated that the use of formulaic sequences is a significant predictor of fluency in the data set (p = 0.015) and that the most frequently used formulaic sequences were those used for clarification and to compare and contrast. Finally, the article discusses pedagogical implications for second language instruction, specifically for improving fluency on standardized computer-based speaking assessments.",

    "description": "The focus of this article is on the design and administration of an online computerized dynamic assessment of an important area of pragmatics: implicature comprehension (i.e., indirect meaning). The assessment centered on indirect acceptances, refusals, and opinions. Drawing on Vygotskian psychology, this assessment had a dual aim: (a) to evaluate test-takers' current capacities as evidenced by independent performance and (b) to evaluate test-takers' emerging capacities as evidenced by their responsiveness to assistance, or mediation, during the test. Sixty-seven US university learners of Chinese as a foreign language, evenly distributed across beginning, intermediate, and advanced course enrollment levels, took the assessment. The results show that while all test-takers were able to improve with assistance, there was a large degree of individual variation in responsiveness to mediation. In line with the notion of the zone of proximal development, we interpret our findings as evidence that the performances observed with mediation are more informative as a diagnosis of learner capability than independent performance alone. Our discussion therefore focuses on the implications of our testing approach for developing individual teaching and learning plans for test-takers, as well as directions for future research.",

    "description": "Learning analytics (LA) offer benefits and challenges for online learning, but prior to collecting data on high-stakes summative assessments as proof of student learning, LA researchers should engage instructors as partners to ensure the quality of course materials through the formative evaluation of individual items (Bienkowski et al., 2012; Dyckhoff et al., 2013; Mantra, 2019; van Leeuwen, 2015). This exploratory study describes a visualization tool that provides actionable data for early intervention with students, and actionable data highlighting odd patterns in student responses (Chatti et al., 2012; Gibson &amp; de Freitas, 2016; Morgenthaler, 2009; Pei et al., 2017), thus allowing instructors to make full use of their teaching skillset in the online environment as they would in a traditional classroom (Davis &amp; Varma, 2008; Dunbar, et al., 2014; Grossman &amp; Thompson, 2008; Lockyer et al., 2013). To answer research questions related to the value of learning analytics and their use in making informed decisions about student learning, a visualization tool was developed for and piloted in an online French course. The findings suggest that using this tool can lead not only to intervention with low-achieving students but can also determine if students struggle due to poor course materials.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effects of corrective feedback (CF) during in-class computer-mediated collaborative writing on grammatical accuracy in a new piece of individual writing. Forty-eight ESL students at an American university worked on two computer-mediated animation description tasks in pairs. The experimental group received indirect CF on English indefinite and definite articles from the researcher during the tasks, while the comparison group worked on the same tasks without CF. Each computer screen was recorded during the treatment, so that the number of revision contributions from each individual learner could be identified. L2 development was measured by a pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest, where the students worked on an animation-description task without a partner. A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant relationship between the presence of CF and accuracy improvement over time. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses suggested a significant relationship between the number of learners' revision contributions and the delayed posttest scores when the pretest scores held constant. That is, individual learners' long-term L2 development varied depending on the extent to which they contributed to the revision. These findings demonstrate the importance of tracking individuals' contributions while calling for more detailed collection of data on actual revisions and the distribution of revision work within pairs or groups.",

    "description": "We developed the Scaffolding English E-assessment Learning (SEEL), where instant feedback and scaffolding hints were provided, to facilitate students to acquire the knowledge of English grammar. On the other hand, an empirical study was conducted to investigate how cognitive styles (i.e. Holists vs. Serialists) affected learners' reactions to the SEEL, including learning performance, learning perception and learning behavior. The results indicated that Holists and Serialists demonstrated similar learning perception. Nevertheless, they showed different learning behavior, which corresponded to the characteristics of their cognitive styles. Additionally, Holists obtained better post-test scores and gain scores than Serialists. This might be because Holists could make the best use of various hints and benefit from feedback provided by the SEEL while Serialists needed additional support. The findings could provide guidance for incorporating personalization into the SEEL so that the needs and preferences of Holists and Serialists could be accommodated. Nevertheless, such findings are correlational in nature and, we, thus, leave open questions concerning causality. Implications for instructional design are also discussed in this study.",

    "description": "This study analyzed eTandem video-conferencing exchanges between five pairs of university students of English as a foreign language (EFL) and Spanish as a foreign language (SFL). The exchanges, which involved discussion of seven tasks, took place on a weekly basis. Drawing on an interactionist perspective (Ellis et al., 2001a; Loewen, 2005), the study explored the impact of incidental noticing on subsequent language learning. Data were collected from two sources: transcripts of all the video-conferencing sessions and immediate and delayed post-tests. Drawing on Loewen's (2005) framework of analysis, the transcripts revealed that students generated a total of 915 focus-on-form episodes (FFEs). As measured by the post-tests, participants recalled over half of the targeted FFE linguistic items. In contrast to previous studies (Loewen, 2005; Shekary &amp; Tahririan, 2006), where successful uptake was a predictor for L2 learning, the present study revealed that the only significant predictor was deferred timing. More generally, the present study supports the claim that eTandem video-conferencing is a useful activity for promoting L2 acquisition.",

    "description": "In the digital wilds, thriving storytelling practices (often in transcultural and multilingual contexts) share with Maker culture a belief in learning through doing, bricolage, collaboration, and playfulness. Key examples are fanfiction, a form of creative writing that transforms popular media in some way, and interactive fiction, a form of nonlinear narrative that verges on the world of gaming. This paper documents a pedagogical intervention carried out within the FanTALES project, which leverages creative writing and meaning-making practices from the digital wilds, in order to develop teaching and learning activities that engage secondary school learners in the writing of multilingual interactive fanfiction. Adolescent learners of English as a foreign language (N=21) wrote multilingual interactive fanfiction based on the digital game series Assassin's Creed. Qualitative content analysis of focus groups with these learners suggests that they experienced intrinsic motivation and developed skills in language and storytelling as well as transversal competences. They also dealt with a lowered sense of autonomy due to the open-endedness of the tasks, and struggled with a lack of sufficient knowledge about storytelling practices and the source text, as well as with project management. Potential improvements for the pedagogical implementation include more scaffolding of the tasks, and better integration with curriculum and assessment.",

The other one was a VR version in which participants put on a VR headset and produced the target speech act for the interlocutor in the virtual space. Five native and five non-native speakers of English completed both versions and participated in a follow-up interview. The purpose of the interview was to examine similarities and differences in participants' perceptions of the two role-play tasks in four areas: (1) thought processes (what they were thinking during the task); (2) recall (what they remembered about the task); (3) difficulty (what made the task difficult); and (4) enjoyment (whether the task was fun). Results revealed that the participants attended to various audio-visual cues in the VR scene and used them to guide their actions. The VR version also evoked greater emotional reactions from the participants.",

Robot users and classmates use human pronouns to describe the robot user and discuss a process of adjusting to its presence. The physical configuration of the classroom can either facilitate or hinder this process. The research provides greater understanding of the experiences of students in a face-to-face classroom that includes remote students attending class using a telepresence robot.

    "description": "The coronavirus pandemic has adversely affected all sectors globally including the education sector. Education institutes across all levels (preprimary, primary, secondary, and higher education) have closed in 188 countries across the globe. Prolonged closure of colleges and schools has forced the educational sector to adopt the online mode of teaching. But one question that is bothering most of the academicians is: Can this online mode of teaching standalone in the long run? To answer this question, our article has proposed an alternative model of delivering education in the time of crisis. This article also helps to explore and compare different modes of course delivery. It also tries to compare and contrast different modes of education through Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis. This article limits its analysis to management education only. An in-depth systematic review from various research papers, articles, cases was done for this article to suggest the model. We found that the management education in India needs a paradigm shift in design, delivery, and assessment and as has been the trend, the trend-setter has to be the faculty in association with the learner. The article recommends that the college administration and faculties should design curriculum in such a system which is more practice-oriented, has more interning hours and where theory gets tested and tried in the field.",

    "author": "Aldukhayel, Dukhayel",
    "description": "This study investigated the effects of captions on the listening comprehension of vlogs. A total of 96 EFL learners watched three vlogs under one of three conditions: L2 captions, L1 captions, and no captions. Each group included low-, mid-, and high-level proficiency learners. The vlogs differed in the pictorial support of the audio, with Vlog 1 being highly supported, Vlog 2 being partially supported, and Vlog 3 being slightly supported by pictorial images. After each vlog, the participants took a multiple-choice test measuring their comprehension of details. Afterwards, participants completed a questionnaire about their perception of captions. The findings suggest that the availability of captions may not necessarily lead to better listening comprehension because students, particularly lower proficiency learners, were unable to simultaneously process the multiple modalities (images, audio, and captions) due to their limited capacities of working memory and cognitive load. High-proficiency learners achieved better comprehension than low-and mid-proficiency learners and achieved their best comprehension with L2 captions. A significant increase in comprehension of vlogs caused by high pictorial support was detected, with the inverse relationship also being true. Analysis of the questionnaire indicated that participants consider L2 captions useful. For both L2 and L1 captions, students think that their listening comprehension would decrease without captions. When considering vlogs for L2 listening, language proficiency and pictorial support are better indicators of levels of comprehension. Captions might be beneficial when learners' proficiency level is high. When visual images are highly supportive for the audio, better comprehension of vlogs is likely.",

    "author": "Inceoglu, Sol\u00e8ne, Chen, Wen-Hsin, Lim, Hyojung",
    "description": "An increasing number of studies are exploring the benefits of automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based dictation programs for second language (L2) pronunciation learning (e.g. Chen, Inceoglu &amp; Lim, 2020; Liakin, Cardoso &amp; Liakina, 2015; McCrocklin, 2019), but how ASR recognizes accented speech and the nature of the feedback it provides to language learners is still largely under-researched. The current study explores whether the intelligibility of L2 speakers differs when assessed by native (L1) listeners versus ASR technology, and reports on the types of intelligibility issues encountered by the two groups. Twelve L1 listeners of English transcribed 48 isolated words targeting the /[near-close front unrounded vowel]-i/ and /[near-open front unrounded vowel]-[open-mid front unrounded vowel]/ contrasts and 24 short sentences that four Taiwanese intermediate learners of English had produced using Google's ASR dictation system. Overall, the results revealed lower intelligibility scores for the word task (ASR: 40.81%, L1 listeners: 38.62%) than the sentence task (ASR: 75.52%, L1 listeners: 83.88%), and highlighted strong similarities in the error types -- and their proportions -- identified by ASR and the L1 listeners. However, despite similar recognition scores, correlations indicated that the ASR recognition of the L2 speakers' oral productions mirrored the L1 listeners' judgments of intelligibility in the word and sentence tasks for only one speaker, with significant positive correlations for one additional speaker in each task. This suggests that the extent to which ASR approaches L1 listeners at recognizing accented speech may depend on individual speakers and the type of oral speech.",

    "description": "Speech recognition technology (SRT) is now widely used in education because of its potential to aid learning, particularly language learning. Nevertheless, SRT has received only limited attention in earlier review studies. The present research aimed to address this gap in the field. To this end, 26 articles published in SSCI journals between 2014 and 2020 were selected and reviewed with respect to domain and skills, technology and their application, participants and duration, measures, reported results, and advantages and disadvantages of SRT. The results showed that English received much more attention than any other language, and scholars mostly focused on facilitating pronunciation skills. Dragon Naturally Speaking and Google speech recognition were the most popular technologies, and their most frequent application was providing feedback. According to the results, college students were involved in research more than any other group, most studies were carried out for less than one month, and most scholars administered a questionnaire or pre-/posttest to collect the data. Positive results related to gains in proficiency and student perceptions of SRT were identified. The study revealed that improved affective factors and enhanced language skills were advantages, whereas a low accuracy rate and insufficiency (i.e. lack of some useful features to support learning efficiently) of SRT were disadvantages. Based on the results, the study puts forward several implications and suggestions for educators and researchers in the field.",

    "description": "Virtual exchange (VE) is an ideal venue for digital literacy skills development (Fuchs, Hauck &amp; M\u00fcller-Hartmann, 2012) and for critical digital literacy (CDL) (Hauck, 2019). Yet literacy is a fluid, deictic term, the meaning of which is context dependent, and digital literacies need to be defined and conceptualised within a specific context. Recent CALL literature highlights the interest in CDL from various perspectives, but how CDL is conceptualised by the VE participants themselves is not explored. Participants of this study were 37 trainee English language teachers in the UK and Turkey who joined a 6-week VE. Their ongoing reflections on CDL were captured through reflective e-portfolio entries following each VE task. Thematic analysis revealed four components of CDL in this specific VE: (1) participants' awareness of digital affordances for &quot;self-expression,&quot; (2) semiotic and interactional means to &quot;build connections,&quot; (3) ensuring &quot;inclusiveness&quot; of all community members, and (4) implications of &quot;socio-political contexts&quot; of each participant for meaning-making and interaction. We conclude that in future pedagogical implementations of VE, facilitators can foster trainee teachers' CDL development through more closely guided and informed reflection on the four themes presented in this paper. As such, this study makes a novel contribution to our understanding of CDL in VE settings for ELT teacher education by offering a social semiotic second language acquisition orientation within an interpretivist paradigm.",

The study was conducted with 30 senior Turkish undergraduate EFL students. The data were collected via video and audio recordings of three opinion-exchange tasks, a background and post-task questionnaire, and an interview that includes a retrospective think-aloud protocol. The participants worked in groups of five to complete the opinion-exchange tasks in each of the three environments. The findings indicated that the participants made use of a wide range of CSs, and although some of the CSs differed, mostly the same types were employed in all the environments. However, the results revealed that the frequency of CSs showed variance among environments, with the highest number in the VC environment and the lowest in the VW. It was possible to establish a connection between the differences in the frequency and the types of strategy use with the distinctive features of the environments, the proficiency level of the participants, and the type of the tasks that was utilized. Additively, 10 new strategy types were discovered.",

    "description": "Video materials require learners to manage concurrent verbal and pictorial processing. To facilitate second language (L2) learners' video comprehension, the amount of presented information should thus be compatible with human beings' finite cognitive capacity. In light of this, the current study explored whether a reduction in multimodal comprehension scaffolding would lead to better L2 comprehension gain when viewing captioned videos and, if so, which type of reduction (verbal vs. nonverbal) is more beneficial. A total of 62 L2 learners of English were randomly assigned to one of the following viewing conditions: (1) full captions + animation, (2) full captions + static key frames, (3) partial captions + animation, and (4) partial captions + static key frames. They then completed a comprehension test and cognitive load questionnaire. The results showed that while viewing the video with reduced nonverbal visual information (static key frames), the participants had well-rounded performance in all aspects of comprehension. However, their local comprehension (extraction of details) was particularly enhanced after viewing a key-framed video with full captions. Notably, this gain in local comprehension was not as manifest after viewing animated video content with full captions. The qualitative data also revealed that although animation may provide a perceptually stimulating viewing experience, its transient feature most likely taxed the participants' attention, thus impacting their comprehension outcomes. These findings underscore the benefit of a reduction in nonverbal input and the interplay between verbal and nonverbal input. The findings are discussed in relation to the use of verbal and nonverbal input for different pedagogical purposes.",

    "description": "Corpus-based language teaching is one area of second language (L2) pedagogy in which L2 teachers may benefit from extensive guidance on how to integrate digital tools into pedagogical practices. Direct corpus approaches like data-driven learning (DDL) cultivate learner engagement and language discovery. However, second language writing (SLW) teachers face significant challenges using corpora in the classroom, and these challenges often go unaddressed in language teacher education, particularly for in-service teachers. This paper reports on a case study in which six university SLW teachers participated in an online corpus-based pedagogy workshop. Teachers developed DDL activity plans and wrote in reflective diaries. The analysis of these artifacts shows that the teachers tended to follow one of two paths toward knowledge integration, as either Planners or Seekers, when implementing corpus activities in their classrooms. The teachers also reported increased confidence in applying direct corpus methods to their lessons by the end of the workshops, though they expressed the need for continued, long-term support.",

To achieve this goal, we initially identified 15 pedagogical principles and practices distinctive of TETBLT. This initial set of principles and practices were motivated by second language acquisition theories (Doughty &amp; Long, 2003), methodological approaches in foreign language teaching (Kramsch, 2014), and state-of-the-art publications on computer-assisted language learning (Chapelle &amp; Sauro, 2017). During the first phase of the study, we consulted an initial group of 34 experts in the field, using the Delphi technique to achieve gradual consensus about the set of principles. After analyzing the first set of responses (N = 23) to the principles, which attained a degree of agreement averaging 71% and ranging from 48% to 96%, we refined the principles incorporating the feedback received and sent out a second questionnaire, which allowed us to reach a consensus about a set of eight robust pedagogical principles for TETBLT.",

    "description": "Given the importance of corpus linguistics in language learning, there have been calls for the integration of corpus training into teacher education programmes. However, the question of what knowledge and skills the training should target remains unclear. Hence, we advance our understanding of measures and outcomes of teacher corpus training by proposing and testing a five-component theoretical framework for measuring teachers' perceived corpus literacy (CL) and its subskills: understanding, search, analysis, and the advantages and limitations of corpora. Also, we hypothesised that teacher CL is linked to their intention to use corpora in classroom teaching. Specifically, 183 teachers and student teachers received corpus training to develop their CL and then completed a survey to measure their CL and intention to use corpora in teaching in Likert-scale items together with open-ended questions. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a hierarchical factor structure for CL using the aforementioned five subfactors best fitted the data. Moreover, structural equation modelling indicated that CL is positively linked to the participants' intention to integrate corpora into classroom teaching. While all five subskills are important for teachers, greater effort should be made to develop their corpus search and analysis skills, which can be viewed as the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of corpus training.",

Along with other benefits, students learn more with instruction that includes active learning opportunities rather than simply passively attending, whether learning face-to-face or online. Fortunately, HE faculty have at their disposal numerous technology tools to increase active learning in their synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid online courses. This technology presents several active learning technologies organized under these online instructional methods: content presentations, game-based and gamification activities, peer collaboration, and multimedia. Mostly, the technologies reviewed are free or relatively low-cost and easy to use, with some available within typical HE learning management systems.",

Both semester-long courses were taught online during the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and in person. The quantitative analysis reveals three insights. First, students are active on Slack throughout the term. Second, students post messages in public channels and extensively use private channels and direct messages. Third, many students follow the conversations, ensuring transparent and fair communication between students and instructors. Open-ended responses suggest that Slack created &quot;team spirit.&quot; I conclude with five recommendations: students should sign up in the first week of term; create channels for different aspects of the module; explain when students can expect a response; encourage private conversations between students; and monitor activities regularly.",

L2 learners used articles more correctly and produced advanced-stage questions more frequently in text-based SCMC than in F2F.

    "description": "Previous research has documented that collaborative dialogue promotes L2 learning in both face-to-face (F2F) and synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) modalities. However, relatively little research has explored modality effects on collaborative dialogue. Thus, motivated by sociocultual theory, this study examines how F2F compares with SCMC regarding the generation of collaborative dialogue specifically in terms of its frequency and nature. Thirty-two Chinese English as a foreign language (EFL) students participated in this study and completed two types of collaborative tasks (i.e. dictogloss and jigsaw) in dyads in both modalities. The analyses of learners' exchanges focused on language-related episodes (LREs), the instantiation of collaborative dialogue. The identified LREs were categorized based on their focus, outcome and type. A follow-up questionnaire was conducted to elicit students' perspectives. The results revealed that LREs were more frequent in SCMC than in F2F. Furthermore, the analyses of the nature of LREs indicated some cross-modality differences: whereas SCMC LREs had the features of &quot;orthographical,&quot; &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;self-correction&quot; outcomes, F2F LREs were characterized by &quot;incorrect&quot; and &quot;request for assistance&quot; outcomes. Pedagogical implications and suggestions for the future research were also discussed.",

    "description": "The HoDoo English game was developed to take advantage of the benefits attributed to on-line games while teaching English to native Korean speakers. We expected to see that the improvements in the subjects' English language abilities after playing the HoDoo English game would be associated with increased brain functional connectivity in the areas of the brain involved in the language production (Broca's area) and the understanding (Wernicke's area) networks. Twelve children, aged nine and ten, were asked to play the on-line English education game for 50 minutes per day, five days per week for twelve weeks. At baseline, and again at the end of twelve weeks of game play, each child's English language ability was assessed and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan was conducted. The on-line English education game play effectively improved English language skills, especially in terms of non-verbal pragmatic skills. Following twelve weeks of on-line English education game play, the children showed positive connectivity between Broca's area and the left frontal cortex as well as between Wernicke's area and the left parahippocampal gyrus and the right medial frontal gyrus. Changes in pragmatic scores were positively correlated with average peak brain activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an improvement in English ability and changes in brain activity within language areas after on-line language education game play.",

    "title": "Facilitating Second Language Learners' Listening Comprehension with Second Life and Skype",
    "author": "Levak, Natasha, Son, Jeong-Bae",
    "description": "Learning how to comprehend while listening to a second language is often considered by learners to be a difficult process that can lead to anxiety when trying to communicate (Graham, 2006; Graham &amp; Macaro, 2008). Computer-mediated communication (CMC) can be used to assist in increasing access to native speakers and opportunities to listen. This study investigates the effectiveness of the use of &quot;Second Life&quot; and &quot;Skype&quot; as part of facilitation techniques and the affordances of these online tools for developing listening comprehension. Participants in the study were learning either English or Croatian and were located in Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, Split in Croatia, and Mostar in Bosnia and Hercegovina. A mixed-methods approach was utilised incorporating pre-tests and post-tests (quantitative data) to gain information on the effectiveness of the techniques for developing listening comprehension and in-depth interviews (qualitative data) to gain the participants' views on the perceived effectiveness of the techniques and the affordances of &quot;Second Life&quot; or &quot;Skype&quot;. The results of the study indicate that both techniques resulted in positive gains in the development of listening comprehension. Based on the analysis of the interview data, a more in-depth perspective on the affordances of each online tool was developed, which informed the creation of a new facilitation technique utilising both tools. The study demonstrates how online tools can be used to facilitate interaction between learners and illustrates the need for the selection of online tools for language learning to be based on pedagogy. It is recommended that the selection of tools should be carefully considered in alignment with task aims and the affordances of online tools.",

    "description": "This study sought to determine the difference in text-based negotiated interaction between non-native speakers of English (NNS-NNS) and between non-native and natives (NNS-NS) in terms of the frequency of negotiated instances, successfully resolved instances, and interactional strategy use when the dyads collaborated on Facebook. It involved 10 native English speakers and 30 learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). NNS-NNS dyads consisted of five H-H pairs and five L-L pairs (H and L representing high- and low-proficiency learners). Similarly, NNS-NS dyads comprised five H-N pairs and five L-N pairs (N being native speakers). All dyads were required to use text chats to complete the given reading tasks synchronously in chatrooms on Facebook. The results suggested that negotiated instances, successfully resolved instances, and interactional strategy use occurred more frequently in H-H pairs than in L-N, L-L, or H-N pairs. In terms of strategy use, H-H, H-N, and L-N dyads were likely to engage in negotiated interaction by employing strategies such as clarifying unclear expressions or checking their comprehension, while L-L used interactional mechanisms infrequently and tended to use strategies such as continuers and asking for assistance. The research concludes with the pedagogical implications of the results.",

    "description": "It is usually the case that learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) are exposed to language materials in class only, and of course in such a short space of time, they do not always find enough chance to practice English grammar features and become aware of their grammar mistakes. As a potential solution to this problem, the current study inspects the impact of using cell phones, specifically text messages (via short message service) as supplementary tools, on Iranian elementary level EFL learners' grammar learning. In the first phase of the study, 60 students aged 14 were randomly divided into experimental and comparison groups. Throughout the 12 weeks of treatment, the participants in the experimental group received 120 text messages containing grammar exercises, whereas the participants in the comparison group received a similar number of vocabulary messages as a placebo treatment and were otherwise treated exactly the same as the experimental group. A researcher-made grammar test was used to estimate whether presenting grammar exercises via text messages has any impact on language learners' grammar learning. The results demonstrated that there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in the grammar learning of the participants who practiced grammar points through text messages and those who did not. The researchers also interviewed various stakeholders, comprising ten students, five parents, the teacher, and the school principal. A qualitative content analysis was carried out to find themes relevant to the stakeholders' beliefs about making use of text messages for learning grammar. The findings suggest that text messages can be useful for learning grammar points, since they engage learners' interest and encourage them to study more in order to text the correct answers when they are outside their classrooms.",

    "description": "This case study explores how a Chinese-American novice teacher acted as mediator in a telecollaboration with student teacher (ST) peers in the USA who designed tasks for his English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in China. The novice teacher was instrumental in mediating the student teachers' task design process by providing feedback regarding technological and institutional constraints, and the nuances of his target student population. He appropriated and adapted the tasks to make them relevant for his EFL learners. Against the backdrop of the three dimensions of professional capital--human, social, and decisional--the research questions explored how the novice teacher used the different types of knowledge of context (pedagogical, institutional, technical) in relation to task design, and his perception of his role as mediator. Within a sociocultural framework for telecollaboration studies, this exploratory case study shares characteristics of ethnography, action research, and narrative inquiry. Data triangulation included text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) data (Google Groups, emails), a narrative written by the novice teacher, and a semi-structured, reflective Skype interview with him. The findings indicate that he demonstrated high commitment, thorough preparation, continuous reflection, and development while navigating between his different roles of mediator, assessor, implementer, and field observer.",

    "author": "Ai, Haiyang",
    "description": "Corrective feedback (CF), a response to linguistic errors made by second language (L2) learners, has received extensive scholarly attention in second language acquisition. While much of the previous research in the field has focused on whether CF facilitates or impedes L2 development, few studies have examined the efficacy of gradually modifying the explicitness or specificity of CF as a function of a learner's response to the feedback. Yet, the type and extent of CF needed by a learner, as suggested by Vygotsky (1978), sheds light on whether a learner is developing his or her abilities in a particular area and the ways in which they do it. This paper reports on a study that explores the design, effectiveness and learners' perception toward a &quot;graduated&quot; (Aljaafreh &amp; Lantolf, 1994) approach to CF, i.e., feedback that progresses from very general and implicit to very specific and explicit, in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) environment. The results show that the graduated approach to CF is effective in helping learners to self-identify and self-correct a number of grammatical issues, although an onsite tutor provides necessary remedies when the ICALL system occasionally fails to do its part. Implications for CF research, particularly on the notion of individualized feedback, are also discussed.",

    "description": "Learner agency, the capability of individual human beings to make choices and act on these choices in a way that makes a difference in their lives (Martin, 2004), is instrumental in second language learning because attainment is only arrived at by learner choice (Pavlenko &amp; Lantolf, 2000). If attainment is understood as learner engagement in synchronous, collaborative, spoken interaction which is thought to lead to gains in second language acquisition (SLA), then design considerations that harness learners' agency towards that end is important. This study explores the relationship between learner agency and two different task types, namely an information-gap task and an opinion-sharing task in two peer-to-peer synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) spoken interaction events. Students' choices and how students act on these choices during tasks are analysed using a discourse analysis approach. Audio recordings of four dyads as cases were examined using three analytical dimensions: language functions of verbal interaction, cognitive processing and social processing. The results show that most learners used their agency to reconfigure the tasks from spontaneous to planned interaction, with some choices and actions relating to technology impacting detrimentally on interaction time in the target language. The different tasks were found to filter and channel different types of agency that learners could exercise, namely representational, organisational, and strategic agency as speech acts, and directional agency as a physical act. These types consisted of different natures and purposes and are presented as a framework. The information-gap task supported strategic agency and an opinion-sharing task supported personalisation and identity construction or representational agency.",

The aim of this article is to analyse the evolution of the Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) levels experienced by a group of participants who used the virtual world &quot;Second Life&quot; for oral interaction (VW Group). The data gathered was compared to that of a group of students who completed similar oral interaction activities in the traditional classroom (CR Group). The quantitative and qualitative data analysed indicates that the FLA levels of the VW Group decreased as weeks went by and that they were lower than those experienced by the CR Group. The anonymity afforded by the VW had a positive effect on some of the students, who reported increased self-confidence and decreased nervousness. However, the students' comments suggest that this anonymity may wear off once they feel they know their interlocutor. Anonymity may not be the only reason to explain the decrease in FLA.",

    "author": "Mirzaei, Maryam Sadat, Meshgi, Kourosh, Akita, Yuya, Kawahara, Tatsuya",
    "description": "This paper introduces a novel captioning method, partial and synchronized captioning (PSC), as a tool for developing second language (L2) listening skills. Unlike conventional full captioning, which provides the full text and allows comprehension of the material merely by reading, PSC promotes listening to the speech by presenting a selected subset of words, where each word is synched to its corresponding speech signal. In this method, word-level synchronization is realized by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, dedicated to the desired corpora. This feature allows the learners to become familiar with the correspondences between words and their utterances. Partialization is done by automatically selecting words or phrases likely to hinder listening comprehension. In this work we presume that the incidence of infrequent or specific words and fast delivery of speech are major barriers to listening comprehension. The word selection criteria are thus based on three factors: speech rate, word frequency and specificity. The thresholds for these features are adjusted to the proficiency level of the learners. The selected words are presented to aid listening comprehension while the remaining words are masked in order to keep learners listening to the audio. PSC was evaluated against no-captioning and full-captioning conditions using TED videos. The results indicate that PSC leads to the same level of comprehension as the full-captioning method while presenting less than 30% of the transcript. Furthermore, compared with the other methods, PSC can serve as an effective medium for decreasing dependence on captions and preparing learners to listen without any assistance.",

The findings may promise implications for language teacher educators to effectively introduce CL to student teachers in virtual learning environments.",

    "description": "Computer-assisted language learning, or CALL, is an interdisciplinary area of research, positioned between science and social science, computing and education, linguistics and applied linguistics. This paper argues that by appropriating methods originating in some areas of CALL-related research, for example human-computer interaction (HCI) or psycholinguistics, the agenda of &quot;attention-focus&quot; research can be shifted from a cognitive perspective to a learner-centred approach; understanding online language learning and teaching spaces as mediated by technology; second/foreign language learning; and online teaching culture. Taking a method that has traditionally been used within a positivist paradigm, the authors exemplify the potential of eyetracking to advance online language learning research--extending it in ways compatible with a sociocultural paradigm. This is evidenced by two pioneering studies in which an innovative combination of methods allows participants, whose gaze focus was recorded during synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC), to reflect back on their involvement. Eyetracking is combined with stimulated recall interviews that trigger deep refection on learner and teacher strategies by directing participants' recollections on their attention focus. The rich, multifaceted results shown by this original and innovative use of eyetracking methods in a sociocultural framework suggest a way forward in researching online learning by integrating insider and outside views coherently and systematically.",

    "description": "This study explored Russian as a foreign language (RFL) learners' self-reported strategic uses of &quot;VoiceThread&quot; (VT)--a multimodal asynchronous computer-mediated communication tool--in order to gain insights into learner perceived effectiveness of VT for second language (L2) oral skills development and to determine the factors that contributed to those perceptions. The participants were eight undergraduate students who attended six weekly tutoring sessions that combined face-to-face (F2F) RFL instruction with VT activities. VT allowed them to access text-based, graphic, video, and aural linguistic input; record and store audio/video-recorded output; listen and comment on peers' recordings; and receive individualized teacher feedback on oral performance. Data from activity logs and researcher field notes were triangulated with participants' responses to two surveys and a semi-structured oral interview. Findings indicated that participants believed that VT supported their oral proficiency development through the provision of additional time and resources for independent planning, rehearsal, and controlled production of L2 forms. Most participants also agreed that VT's playback and record features were the most beneficial for developing language skills, enhancing the reflection process, and facilitating self-assessment and creativity in the L2. Yet, despite VT's multimodal affordances and the availability of communicative tasks via VT, participants did not perceive VT as a social environment that could promote peer-to-peer interaction or replace F2F communication. A thematic data analysis suggested that participants' preferences for language learning tasks influenced their strategic uses of VT's features, which ultimately affected their perceptions of VT's value for promoting meaningful language learning interactions. Pedagogical considerations are discussed.",

This study thus adopted Reciprocal Teaching (RT) as an instructional framework to support students' reading comprehension progress and processes, facilitated by the use of online annotations. A total of 54 English language learners at a university were recruited to read with online annotations based on the RT procedure, namely predicting, clarifying, questioning, and summarizing. The data collected included the students' scores on pre- and post-tests and their participation records in a collaborative learning environment. The results reveal that the students enhanced their reading comprehension after the intervention. Their reading processes were also analyzed, and the major differences between the groups making more and less progress were identified. Those who made more progress not only frequently reviewed their previously generated predictions, clarifications, questions, and summaries but also actively provided feedback to their peers in a reciprocal manner. Pedagogical implications and recommendations are discussed.",

    "description": "The aim of the paper is to investigate the role of dictionary form (paper versus electronic) in language reception, production and retention. The body of existing research does not give a clear answer as to which dictionary medium benefits users more. Divergent findings from many studies into the topic might stem from differences in research methodology (including the various tasks, participants and dictionaries used by different authors). Even a series of studies conducted by one researcher (Dziemianko, 2010, 2011, 2012b) leads to contradictory conclusions, possibly because of the use of paper and electronic versions of existing dictionaries, and the resulting problem with isolating dictionary form as a factor. To be able to argue with confidence that the results obtained follow from different dictionary formats, rather than presentation issues, research methodology should be improved. To successfully generalize about the significance of the medium for decoding, encoding and learning, the current study replicates previous research, but the presentation of lexicographic data on paper and on screen is now balanced, and the paper/electronic opposition is operationalized more appropriately. A real online dictionary and its paper-based counterpart composed of printouts of screen displays were used in the experiment in which the meaning of English nouns and phrases was explained, and collocations were completed with missing prepositions. A delayed post-test checked the retention of the meanings and collocations. The results indicate that dictionary medium does not play a statistically significant role in reception and production, but it considerably affects retention.",

    "description": "This article discusses insights gained from a case study on telecollaboration for intercultural communication in foreign language school contexts. Focus was on non-native English and German lingua franca conversations between pairs of students (aged 14-16, B1 level) from schools in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Telecollaboration support included the BigBlueButton video communication platform and Moodle chat. The overall objective was to explore the pedagogical potential of pedagogical lingua franca exchanges via telecollaboration for authentic intercultural communication practice and foreign language competence development beyond the face-to-face classroom. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of oral and written lingua franca conversations and corresponding reflective feedback interviews provided evidence of (a) increased learner agency in connection with communicative participation, topic development, languaging for communicative success and rapport building, and (b) emerging emancipatory qualities of non-native speaker identity including a growing sense of speaker satisfaction and trust in one's own creativity and strategic resourcefulness. The crucial pedagogical key was an open, social constructivist language learning orientation combined with rich opportunities for authentic communication. Intercultural communicative competence development was significantly improved, and transcending the foreign language classroom to include elements of real life became a tangible experience for the students and teachers involved.",

A total of 13 CSL learners participated in the study. They were assigned nine discussion topics over the semester and were asked to send their recordings via the WeChat platform. Two native Chinese speakers were employed as research assistants who were responsible for providing the students with feedback based on their oral production. The results show that mobile-assisted corrective feedback is centred on overt correction, mainly targeting the linguistic aspects of grammar and vocabulary, whereas positive feedback is concentrated on affirmation, with content and vocabulary as the most frequently focused linguistic targets. In addition, the findings revealed positive attitudes by students toward mobile-assisted feedback and confirmed the facilitative role of WeChat feedback in enhancing their speaking ability. It is therefore suggested that smartphone social communication apps be applied to foreign language teaching for the provision of feedback and other learning activities.",

    "description": "Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) learners generally encounter difficulty in using some special rules of Chinese grammar because such grammar points do not exist in their native languages. CFL learners require an effective learning strategy to assist them in acquiring a greater understanding of Chinese grammar. Thus, we integrated a self-explanation strategy into a Chinese-learning system. Specifically, the system includes self-explanation prompts, instructional feedback, and remedial learning materials. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of using a self-explanation strategy on Chinese sentence learning in a computer-assisted language learning environment. The participants were assigned to an experiment group with self-explanation instruction and a control group without self-explanation to practice Chinese grammar points. Learning performance, including grammar tests and cognitive loads, was measured. The results showed higher learning outcomes for Chinese grammar and sentence structure in the self-explanation group. Furthermore, no significant difference in cognitive load was observed between the two groups. Implications for using self-explanation in computer-assisted language learning are discussed.",

    "description": "The present study aimed to examine whether agent-based instruction would privilege English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners any better than mainstream approaches (e.g. analogical reasoning, guessing from context, image formation, semantic analysis, etc.) when it comes to the teaching of English idioms. It also sought to explore whether learning from multimedia agents and retention of English idioms would be differentially impacted if agent modality were concerned. To this end, three constellations of EFL learners, each consisting of 30 participants, received instruction on 128 English idioms under one of three conditions: One group received treatment through an anthropomorphic pedagogical agent that was capable of coordinating speech with a diverse range of human paralinguistic behaviors. Another group received treatment on the target idioms through a non-anthropomorphic agent in the form of an animated hand with a pointing finger that was capable of showing a small subset of human non-verbal behaviors. The other group received treatment on English idioms the conventional way, that is, through teacher-fronted instruction. The findings revealed that the participants learned better from agent-based instruction and that the pointing finger had proved even more efficient in teaching English idioms.",

    "description": "Instruction in English is a priority around the globe, but instructional methodologies have not always kept pace with the changing needs of students. To explore the benefits of the flipped classroom model for learners of English as a Foreign Language, the researchers used flipped learning and Wen's Output-driven/Input-enabled model to design a holistic oral training course that included extensive online written and verbal communication for the learning of a wide range of English idioms. The participants were 48 sophomore English majors in two required English oral training classes. A within-subjects research design exposed all participants to learning English idioms by flipped learning, using the LINE smartphone app, and by conventional instruction. A mixed research method was employed, using multiple sources of data collection, including pre- and post-tests on idioms, two questionnaires (&quot;Perception of Flipped Learning Experience&quot; and &quot;Technology Acceptance Model&quot;), the teachers' in-class observations, and semi-structured focus-group interviews. The results revealed that the theory-based flipped instruction using online written and oral interaction not only enhanced the participants' motivation, making them more active in using idioms in class, but also significantly improved their idiomatic knowledge, indicating that the flipped learning was successful in achieving the instructional goals of the class. The authors present insights into the impact of theory-based flipped learning on motivation and idiomatic acquisition; student impressions of the online platform used, LINE; and offer recommendations for practice.",

    "description": "Most students of English as a foreign language (EFL) lack sufficient opportunities to practice their English-speaking skills. However, the recent development of social-networking sites (SNSs) and mobile learning, and especially mobile-assisted language learning, represents new opportunities for these learners to practice speaking English in a meaningful way. This study integrated a mobile SNS into first-grade EFL classes in China, with the aim of determining its effects on the students' speaking skills. Two classes were recruited, one as a control group that did not use the SNS, and the other as the experimental group, which did. While both classes' speaking skills improved between pretest and posttest, the gains in English fluency by the experimental group were significantly larger. Progress in accuracy and pronunciation, on the other hand, were similar across the two groups. These findings are discussed in relation to specific characteristics of SNSs and mobile learning that enable learners to speak in low-stress, situated contexts.",

    "author": "Matthews, Joshua, O'Toole, John Mitchell, Chen, Shen",
    "description": "This paper reports on task interaction, task success and word learning among second language (L2) learners of different levels of word recognition from speech (WRS) proficiency who used a CALL application previously shown to be effective in the development of L2 WRS. Participants (N = 65) were categorised into three levels of L2 WRS proficiency according to their baseline ability to accurately recognise the phonological form of words in connected speech. All participants undertook the same web-based intervention task which involved reconstructing spoken text into the written form in a number of stages. In terms of task interaction, lower WRS proficiency participants chose to listen to stimulus material more often and changed their efforts at reconstruction significantly more frequently than participants of higher WRS proficiency levels. In relation to task success, lower WRS proficiency learners were significantly less accurate overall and less immediate in their arrival at peak reconstruction accuracy than higher WRS proficiency participants. A comparison of gain scores also showed that participants of different L2 WRS proficiency experienced significantly different word learning outcomes after using the application, with moderate WRS proficiency participants significantly outperforming lower WRS proficiency level learners in relation to academic word learning. A synthesis of the results is used to recommend design features of CALL for WRS development which will more adequately cater to learners of different L2 WRS proficiency levels. The paper concludes with some avenues for future research and some implications for the integration of computer-mediated L2 WRS development as a component of L2 listening instruction.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effects of two modes of corrective feedback, namely, face-to-face recasts and computer-mediated recasts during video-conferencing on Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' second language (L2) development. Moreover, the accuracy of the learners' interpretations of recasts in the two modalities was examined. Fifty-seven EFL learners were assigned into three conditions. In the first condition, learners were involved in dyadic face-to-face communication with their teacher during which learners' errors were corrected by the teacher via recasts. In the second treatment condition, learners communicated with their teacher through video chat (using Skype) in a laboratory and received oral computer-mediated recasts for the errors they made. Finally, the learners of the control condition were involved in face-to-face communication but received no corrective feedback for their errors. Learners' development was measured through an oral production task and an error correction test. The results indicated that computer-mediated and face-to-face recasts were equally effective for enhancing learners' L2 development. Furthermore, analyzing learners' perceptions of recasts elicited through stimulated recall interviews revealed no statistical difference in learners' interpretations of recasts in the two instructional modes. The study concludes that video-based online oral corrective feedback can be as effective as traditional face-to-face feedback.",

    "author": "Boers, Frank, Warren, Paul, Grimshaw, Gina, Siyanova-Chanturia, Anna",
    "description": "Several research articles published in the realm of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) have reported evidence of the benefits of multimodal annotations, i.e. the provision of pictorial as well as verbal clarifications, for vocabulary uptake from reading. Almost invariably, these publications account for the observed benefits with reference to Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory,&quot; suggesting it is the visual illustration of word meaning that enhances the quality of processing and hence makes new words more memorable. In this discussion article, we explore the possibility that it is not necessarily the multimodality &quot;per se&quot; that accounts for the reported benefits. Instead, we argue that the provision of multimodal annotations is one of several possible means of inviting more and/or longer attention to the annotations--with amounts of attention given to words being a significant predictor of their retention in memory. After reviewing the available research on the subject and questioning whether invoking Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory&quot; is an optimal account for reported findings, we report an eye-tracking study the results of which are consistent with the alternative thesis that the advantage of multimodal glosses for word learning lies with the greater quantity of attention these glosses attract in comparison with single-mode glosses. We conclude with a call for further research on combinations and sequences of annotation types, regardless of multimodality, as ways of promoting vocabulary uptake from reading.",

We aimed to understand publications' trend, research focus, technology used, methodology, and current issues. Our results showed that there was increasing trend in the publications. Students' perceptions towards mobile learning technologies and language proficiency were the most common research topics. The most frequently used technologies were smartphones, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants, whereas the most common target language was English as a foreign language. In addition, university and elementary school students were the most common participants. We found that learning activities in most studies were carried out in classroom and specified locations outside of campus. Authentic learning environments in most studies were familiar to students and learning activities were designed using instructor-centered approach. Most studies collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data. We also discovered some issues associated with earlier studies, e.g. many studies did not focus on applying newly learned knowledge by students to solve their real-life problems or recently developed intelligent technologies for language learning were overlooked. Based on our results, we discuss some implications and make suggestions over mobile language learning in authentic environments for the educators and researchers.",

    "description": "Though pedagogical beliefs have been identified as critical factors in the success of technology integration, very few studies have included them in technology-adoption models. The present study revises the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by adding teachers' pedagogical beliefs, and tests the revised model among university-level English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in China. Specifically, the revised model examines how teachers' constructivist and/or transmissive pedagogical beliefs influence four key constructs of the TAM: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward use, and intention to use. Survey data were collected from 202 Chinese EFL teachers and analyzed using path analysis. The revised model showed a good model fit. The results indicated that the sampled teachers' pedagogical beliefs were more constructivist-oriented than transmissive-oriented, and that the former type of beliefs had a significant positive influence on three of the above-mentioned TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward use). Teachers' transmissive pedagogical beliefs, on the other hand, did not have any significant impact on their attitudes toward information and communication technology (ICT) or their perceptions of its usefulness, though such beliefs did significantly affect their perceptions of how easy ICT was to use. Implications of these findings for teacher education and professional training are discussed.",

Facebook is one of the easiest and quickest ways to communicate with other people, therefore it may potentially be used to promote intercultural communicative effectiveness (ICE), one of the subcomponents of ICC. Within this scope, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Facebook on ICE among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. A mixed-methods research was employed, the data were gathered from multiple sources including pre- and post-administration of intercultural effectiveness scale, semi-structured interviews, and students' essays. Three conclusions were reached in this study. First, the intercultural instruction had a significantly positive effect on learners' ICE. Second, the discussion on Facebook group had significantly higher ICE scores than the in-class discussion group. Third, most of the students had positive attitudes and feelings towards the intercultural instruction and the use of Facebook for developing ICE.",

This multi-case study investigates how mobile technologies mediate a group of Hong Kong university students' L2 learning, which serves as a lens with which to capture the personalised, unique, contextual and ubiquitous nature of mobile language learning. The results suggest that Hong Kong university students make use of varied e-resources and tools for learning their L2; they also tend to combine L2 learning with subject learning, communication, entertainment and personal interests, and reveal distinctive features and attributes that form their personalised learning approaches. Based on these, a new socio-cultural framework is constructed to capture the key components involved in mobile technologies-mediated L2 learning and to describe the dynamism and interaction among the components, involving L2 agency, personalisation, tools, knowledge, communications and entertainment. In addition, L2 agency plays an important role in determining how learners employ mobile technologies in mediating and personalising their language learning. Factors that influence personalised mobile language learning are also unveiled. Finally, a number of implications are derived from the research findings to inform further research or practice with regard to mobile language learning.",

    "description": "The current study aimed at investigating the effects of three types of prewriting planning conditions, namely teacher-monitored collaborative planning (TMCP), student-led collaborative planning (SLCP), and individual planning (IP) on EFL learners' computer-mediated L2 written production and learning transfer from a pedagogic task to a new task of similar complexity. To this end, 76 EFL learners were randomly assigned into one of the three groups: TMCP group, SLCP group, and IP group. Two complex letter writing tasks were used in this study to collect the required data: complex task 1 (CT 1) and complex task 2 (CT 2). To perform CT 1, at first, the participants in TMCP and SLCP groups were required to have prewriting collaborative planning via Telegram instant messaging, while the participants in IP group were required to do the prewriting planning individually. To examine learning transfer, one week after they performed CT 1, the participants in the three groups were asked to perform CT 2 for which there was no planning time. The results revealed that (1) the three types of prewriting planning conditions used in the present study promoted different dimensions of the participants' computer-mediated L2 writing, (2) the participants in different groups differently transferred their linguistic abilities to the new task, and (3) factors such as teachers' monitoring and directing students' performance seemed to channel the participants' attention toward specific dimensions of L2 production and hence influenced the quality of their L2 writing and learning transfer. Implications are discussed, and avenues for future research are outlined.",

    "description": "Collaborative learning has been widely applied in education, and has been seen as conducive to student learning. The advent of technology and its applications in education have also greatly enhanced the classroom learning environment, leading to increasing research attention on the combination of technology and collaboration. The case study discussed in this article explores collaborating learners' patterns of interaction in an Internet-enhanced, face-to-face collaborative setting by investigating learners' interactions with peers and online resources. Four graduate-level ESL learners (three Taiwanese and one Japanese) worked in pairs to write an essay with the support of online resources. The construct of high quality collaboration was used to examine learners' interaction patterns. Three distinctive scaffolding patterns among learners and online resources were identified: (1) peer-to-peer scaffolding, (2) multi-directional scaffolding, and (3) individual scaffolding. The findings suggest that online resources can facilitate critical scaffolding in learners' interaction and knowledge construction, which also encourages collaborative learner autonomy. The proficiency gap between collaborating learners was also observed to be alleviated through the support of online resources for the less proficient peers. This study sheds light on the role online resources can play in collaborative language learning.",

    "description": "Although corrective feedback (CF) has received much interest in the second language acquisition literature, relatively little research has investigated the relationship between CF and learner affect in concrete practice situations. The present study investigates learners' affective states and practice behaviour in a novel context: oral grammar practice with a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system employing automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology to analyse learners' speech and provide feedback. Thirty-one adult learners of Dutch practiced with this system in one of two conditions: the no-feedback condition (NOCF) and the feedback condition (CF) which provided immediate CF through ASR. Despite concerns that CF can elicit negative affective reactions and although practice with feedback forced learners to reformulate more often, CF did not appear to have a negative impact. Our analysis finds no significant differences between the NOCF and CF groups. A significant correlation between practice performance and self-efficacy was found in the CF only. These findings suggest that ASR-enabled CALL systems may be suitable environments for oral grammar practice where CF on oral productions can be provided without negative affective responses, and that without feedback, learners may develop self-efficacy beliefs which do not necessarily reflect their actual performance.",

It focused on their acquisition of academic and low-frequency words that appeared in the readings assigned by two content-based English for academic purposes (EAP) courses required for ELLs at a large Canadian university. The intervention was aligned with the lesson plans of the courses. Data in this study were collected from follow-up interviews (n = 10) and a post-treatment survey (n = 40) from a total of 48 students who participated in the intervention. The results revealed students' overall positive experience with the intervention, the feasibility of the intervention design and its effectiveness in supporting ELLs' vocabulary learning. The findings, students' suggestions for improving the intervention, and directions for future research are discussed.",

    "description": "Technology-mediated task environments have long been considered integral parts of L2 learning and teaching processes. However, the interactional resources that the learners deploy to complete tasks in these environments have remained largely unexplored due to an overall focus on task design and outcomes rather than task engagement processes. With this gap in mind, we set out to describe the emergence, development, and diversification of L2 (English) interactional resources oriented to task completion using conversation analysis for the examination of 13\u00a0hours of screen-recorded online task-oriented interactions collected over 18 weeks. The focal tasks in the study have been designed as emergent information-gap tasks that require the participants to maintain progressivity by both displaying their own and converging with their co-participants' dynamic knowledgeability for task completion purposes. A longitudinal investigation into task engagement processes has demonstrated that the participants fail to display their knowledge congruently and they repeatedly disrupt the progressivity of task-oriented interaction in earlier weeks. However, an observable diversification of interactional resources for collaborative task accomplishment has been recorded in later weeks, which demonstrates the development of interactional competence over time. These findings bring insights into interactional competence, epistemics, and CALL with special reference to technology-mediated TBLT.",

    "description": "Using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, this study aimed to evaluate the design of one multimedia courseware used for teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) in China and to compare the attitudinal differences in the teachers' and students' evaluation of the courseware. A questionnaire was developed and validated. Results indicated that the design of the courseware generally complied with the coherence principle, the signalling principle, the spatial contiguity principle, and the temporal contiguity principle but slightly violated the redundancy principle. The results of the independent sample t-tests on the questionnaires and the further analyses of the interviews revealed that there were statistically significant differences in the teachers' and students' evaluation concerning the coherence principle, the redundancy principle, and the spatial contiguity principle. Findings of this study suggested that the cognitive theory of multimedia learning can be a useful tool for evaluating multimedia courseware for teaching and learning EFL, as the theory is firmly grounded on the characteristics of human cognitive architecture and places the users in the centre of courseware design and evaluation.",

    "title": "Retesting the Limits of Data-Driven Learning: Feedback and Error Correction",
    "author": "Crosthwaite, Peter",
    "description": "An increasing number of studies have looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students' written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher's feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, and at the same time does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to corpus consultation, and how such feedback affects the success of this consultation.",

The students are at a high-intermediate to advanced level (B2-C1), and are enrolled at an American university in Madrid in courses centring on topics of Spanish language and language teaching. The teacher categorized the discussions as more or less successful, mainly depending on the amount of interaction perceived as taking place, but also on the participants' ability to express the vertical knowledge of the disciplinary concepts they are studying. The study reported on in this article uses functionally oriented models of evaluative language and of knowledge to analyse a &quot;problematic&quot; on-line discussion, along with two other discussions which serve as points of comparison. Quantitative results, in the form of descriptive statistics, are presented in order to underpin a qualitative discussion of where the difficulties lie in students' ability to create an interactive discussion about course knowledge, leading to some suggestions for setting up on-line discussion in content-based courses, especially for students studying through an additional language.",

A total of 167 Korean university students completed online assignments designed to maximize interaction with these devices. The assignments required students to submit their responses regarding assigned reading passages for a semester. Then they completed an online survey of five questions: (a) most frequently used device; (b) reasons for favoring a particular device; (c) limitations of a particular device; (d) better device for facilitating cognitive effort; (e) places where they used a particular device. The results showed that half the participants used PCs and the other half used smartphones. PC users favored &quot;comfortable use,&quot; whereas smartphone users favored &quot;ubiquitous learning.&quot; PC users reported &quot;not easily portable&quot; was the most prominent limitation, whereas smartphone users pointed out &quot;using smartphone's costly data&quot; and &quot;uncomfortable to drag/move&quot; were noticeable limitations. In general however, the majority of both PC and smartphone users reported no limitations in using these devices as learning tools. Regarding facilitating cognitive effort, around 38.0% of participants indicated that there was no difference between these two devices. Most PC users did online assignments either at home or in a dormitory. Smartphone users completed tasks in several different places.",

    "description": "While there is widespread agreement on the expected benefits of hands-on access to corpora for language learners, reports abound of the difficulties involved in realising those benefits in practice. A particular focus of discussion is the challenge of transferring the skills of the corpus linguist to learners, so that they can explore this type of monolingual and unmediated resource effectively in a &quot;learner-as-researcher&quot; or &quot;learner-as-detective&quot; role. In this paper, we present a positive experience of an apprenticeship in corpus use, which we attribute to a training approach that seeks to exploit the unmediated nature of corpora rather than treating it as a problem for learners. Our approach is not aimed at equipping learners with skills that will allow them to derive rules from the systematic analysis of corpus data. Instead we aim to inculcate in our students a propensity for open-ended searches, and an observe-and-borrow-chunks mentality, oriented to copying models from a corpus to enrich and render more accurate their written production in particular. We also see this training process as encouraging their curiosity about language patterns and authentication of the use they make of such patterns, and therefore beneficial to their ongoing development as independent language learners more generally.",

The study compares three groups of L2 French students learning how to produce liaison over a two-month period, following a pretest-posttests design within a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis. Participants were divided into three groups: (1) the TTS Group used a TTS application on their mobile devices to complete weekly pronunciation tasks consisting of noticing, listen-and-categorize, and listen-and-repeat; (2) the Non-TTS Group completed the same weekly pronunciation tasks in weekly sessions with a teacher; finally, (3) the Control Group participated in weekly meetings 'to practice their conversation skills' with a teacher, who provided no pronunciation feedback. The results indicate that, although all three groups improved in liaison production, if considered separately (within groups), only the two experimental groups improved over time. The discussion of our findings highlights the pedagogical use of mobile TTS technology to complement and enhance the teaching of L2 pronunciation.",

    "description": "An increasing amount of research has focused on the exploration of English as a Foreign Language teachers' technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK). However, in the field of native language teaching, such as Taiwanese, Hakka, Aboriginal languages in Taiwan, few studies have paid attention to understanding the teachers' perceptions of TPACK. A survey was therefore conducted to examine 172 in-service Hakka language teachers' perceptions of TPACK in Taiwan. The survey framework includes seven constructs: content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), technological knowledge (TK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), and TPACK. According to the results, although the native language teachers were satisfied with their TPACK on average, they had relatively low confidence in CK, TK, and TPK. While the older male teachers tended to be more confident in their CK, the older female teachers were inclined to have less confidence in their TK. Teaching experience was positively related to the teachers' perceived CK, PK, and PCK. Particularly, the importance of the teachers' TCK, PK, and TK in their synthesized TPACK was identified. This study also provides suggestions for native language teacher training program design in the future.",

As the study adopted a quasi-experimental design, two intact classes, each with ten EFL learners, attending an IELTS course at a language institute in Sanandaj, Iran, were selected as the participants. IELTS academic writing task 1 and task 2 were used to assess the learners' academic writing skills, and a semi-structured interview was conducted to explore the learners' perceptions towards the impact of online peer-editing on academic writing skills. A paired-samples t-test, an independent-samples t-test, and a one-way MANCOVA were used to analyse the quantitative data. The results indicated that peer-editing both through using Google Docs and in the face-to-face classroom significantly developed the learners' academic writing skills, and that the former outperformed the latter both in the short and long term. Moreover, after controlling for the pre-tests, the two groups performed differently on the four areas of academic writing on both the post- and delayed post-tests. Thematic analysis, used to analyse the qualitative data, highlighted the learners' positive perceptions towards the impact of online peer-editing on academic writing skills.",

In order to obtain a true picture of the nature of student-student (non-) collaboration in wiki mediated writing activities, this paper therefore argues that it is necessary to examine students' discussion posts and their edits to the wiki text in tandem. A coding scheme and transcription format which aligns discussion posts with edits to the wiki text is introduced. The insights into student-student collaboration this approach affords are subsequently illustrated through a study which examines Kuwaiti high school students' interactions during a wiki mediated collaborative writing activity. The results of this study confirm that considering discussion posts and edits to the wiki text independently provides an incomplete picture of the nature of student-student (non-) collaboration in wiki mediated writing activities. If discussion posts and editing acts are not considered in tandem, analyses may overlook a number of non-collaborative (e.g. refusing to accept one another's edits and respond to feedback, and claims of ownership over the wiki text) as well as collaborative behaviors (e.g. willingness to accept edits and respond to feedback).",

    "description": "Students of Southeast Asian Heritage Learning Chinese (SSAHLC) in Taiwan have frequently demonstrated difficulty with traditional Chinese (a graphical character) radical recognition due to their limited exposure to the written language form since childhood. In this study, we designed a Chinese radical learning game (CRLG), which adopted a drill and practice mode, for SSAHLC to practice recognizing Chinese radicals. To facilitate Chinese writing, non-native learners need to use aspects of the radical knowledge as cues to encode characters, from which the contents of the game were built up for SSAHLC to master the Chinese written forms by playing the CRLG with gesture-based interactions. In addition, the game was used to explore the students' intrinsic motivation relevant to online learning self-efficacy, as well as the experience of flow, to predict the degree of learning progress. Data were collected from 78 SSAHLC participating in the study, and 73 valid questionnaires were returned. After applying confirmatory factor analysis as well as structural equation modeling to the valid data, it was found that four constructs, namely intrinsic motivation, online learning self-efficacy, flow experience, and learning progress, were all positively correlated. Our results indicated that intrinsic motivation of Chinese learning predicted online learning self-efficacy, and that flow experience was relevant to the students' learning progress. Moreover, the degree of learning progress could be predicted by the mediating factors. These findings imply that heritage language teachers may utilize the CRLG to enhance learners' Chinese radical recognition ability, and eventually improve their Chinese character recognition ability.",

    "description": "This paper presents the results of a study aimed at exploring the possibilities Twitter offers for pronunciation instruction. It investigates the potential of a Twitter-based approach based on explicit instruction and input enhancement techniques to help English Foreing Language (EFL) learners improve their pronunciation of segmental and suprasegmental features that are commonly mispronounced due to lack of conscious attention to form (i.e. noticing) or explicit instruction, lack of exposure to the target language, difficult sound-spelling correspondences, or a combination of these. Additionally, the study investigates the relationship between the learners' level of engagement and their pronunciation improvement, as well as the learners' reactions towards the approach adopted and the way they use social networking sites (SNSs). The study follows a quantitative design, with pre- and post-tests aimed at measuring the learners' pronunciation before and after training, a delayed post-test aimed at measuring whether gains were maintained over time, and two questionnaires that gathered demographic data from participants, their patterns of SNS usage as well as their perceptions towards the approach adopted. The study was conducted with 121 participants divided into control and experimental groups. The approach consisted in sending learners a daily tweet with concise explicit explanations about the target aspects and a link to a video/audio file illustrating the pronunciation of the target word in an authentic context. The results show that the instruction fostered significant improvements in the learners' pronunciation of the target features and that improvements were maintained over time. As for the relationship between engagement and improvement, a positive correlation was found between these two variables, but it was very weak. Finally, the participants' responses to the questionnaires reveal that they considered the tips received as useful and that they perceive Twitter as potentially advantageous for educational purposes.",

The outcome is compared to a repeated-test control group. Pragmatic routines used for agreement, disagreement, and clarification in academic English discussion are targeted. 54 students in seven intact communication classes participated. 43 students received instruction in four 50-minute lessons across two to three weeks. Input came from MICASE (Simpson, Briggs, Ovens, &amp; Swales, 2002) with noticing and production activities. The corpus-materials group (N = 26) received corpus excerpts and the corpus-search group (N = 17) conducted equivalent searches. The pre- and post-tests were administered through a computer delivered oral-production task that simulated group discussion and included 30 items: 10 agreement, 10 disagreement, and 10 clarification scenarios. The results showed that both corpus searches and the use of corpus excerpts led to a significant increase in the oral production of pragmatic routines. The corpus materials group additionally showed an increase in the clarity of speech acts. The corpus-search group reported engagement in self-directed searches outside the classroom, captured by a post-test questionnaire.",

Guided by current approaches to teaching academic writing (Lea &amp; Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001; Swales, 2004) and the knowledge-telling/knowledge-transformation model of Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987), we set out to examine whether and how direct corpus uses afforded by RWT impact novice native and non-native writers' genre learning and writing improvement. In an embedded mixed-methods design, written responses to DDL tasks and writing progress from first to last drafts were recorded from 23 graduate students in separate one-semester courses at a US university. The qualitative and quantitative data sets were used for within-student, within-group, and between-group comparisons--the two independent variables for the latter being course section and language background. Our findings suggest that exploiting technology-mediated corpora can foster novice writers' exploration and application of genre conventions, enhancing development of rhetorical, formal, and procedural aspects of genre knowledge.",

For 16 weekly 90-minute sessions, an experimental group (12 students) used DDL materials created from a corpus developed from the Oxford Bookworms Graded Readers, while a control group (10 students) had no DDL input. Both classes were required to read a minimum of 200,000 words during the course. An embedded-experiment design (Edmonds &amp; Kennedy, 2017) was adopted consisting of both qualitative and quantitative forms of investigation. Quantitative data from the Vocabulary Levels Test by Nation and Beglar (2007) and a C-test (Klein-Braley &amp; Raatz, 1984) constructed from an upper-level Bookworms reader found statistically significant lexicogrammatical improvements for both groups, but greater improvement took place within the control group. Qualitative data derived from a repertory grid analysis of student constructs revealed several possible reasons for the experimental group's lack of engagement with DDL. The study concludes that careful attention to students' learning preferences and a softening of the DDL approach may ensure better results with lower proficiency learners.",

    "description": "Understanding the factors that affect participation in online games will help educational game designers develop games that maximize participation. This study investigated whether introversion or extroversion, player motivation, and gender affected participation in online games. Participants (n = 400) completed a 50-item questionnaire about introversion or extroversion, player motivation, and time spent playing games. A three-way analysis of variance was used to explore the effects of personality, player motivation, and gender on participation. Introverts spent 6.7 more hours playing games than extroverts, and a significant interaction effect was found between personality and gender. The implications of these findings are presented.",

To this end, we explore modern technological classroom enhancements as well as novel pedagogical techniques which facilitate collaborative learning. In our setup, the traditional blackboard or table is replaced by a digitally enabled interactive surface such as a smart board or a tabletop computer. The information displayed on the digital surface can be further enhanced with augmented reality views through mobile apps on student smartphones. We also discuss ways to enhance the instructional process through elements of game mechanics and outline an experimental implementation. Finally, we discuss an application of the proposed technological and pedagogical methods to human anatomy training.",

    "description": "With the advent of open source virtual environments, the associated cost reductions, and the more flexible options, avatar-based virtual reality environments are within reach of educators. By using and repurposing readily available virtual environments, instructors can bring engaging, community-building, and immersive learning opportunities to students. Based on many years of academic research and development within this environment, the authors suggest educationally productive, research-supported ways to create learning environments that can motivate, engage, and educate participants. Instructors can develop virtual communities as centers for meetings, collaborations, and shared experiences, moving distance experiences beyond the limitations of engagement and collaboration in nonimmersive settings. The authors explain how instructors can develop useful learning interactions, pilot their learning environments, assess learners, and evaluate the environment. Specific experiences, images, and videos from the authors' work are shared as well as broader application that could suit multiple purposes in guiding an instructor's development and instructional efforts.",

With the roll out and scale up of sophisticated education technology systems, an important trend in higher education today is distance education. Despite the growing prevalence of distance learning opportunities and the expanding body of research on distance education, research on the college-going decisions of distance learners is sparse. As more students enroll in distance-based postsecondary education programs, it is increasingly important to understand how and why students make the decision to enroll in collegiate degree-granting programs. This study bridges the college choice and distance education literatures to posit a new model of college choice to shed light on students' decisions to enroll in a distance-based, nontraditional degree program.",

This study examined K-12 teachers' perceptions regarding the flipped classroom and differences in teachers' perceptions based on grade level and content area taught. A researcher-developed survey instrument was used to collect data from K-12 teachers that utilize a flipped classroom in Southwest and South Central Minnesota. Survey participants totaled 44, which included 27 high school teachers, 15 middle school teachers, and 2 teachers that identified as other. It was found that participants perceived that the flipped classroom creates time for varied instructional techniques, including active learning and higher order thinking, along with increased student-to-teacher interaction. The insights from the study inform teachers in the field about benefits and best practices in regard to the flipped classroom instructional model.",

    "author": "Elboubekri, Abdellah",
    "description": "Developing an intercultural competence, where language is seen as a cultural construct, seems to be consensually advocated by contemporary theories in teaching and learning English as a foreign language. Given its grounding on cultural studies, intercultural education focuses its pedagogical orientation and strategies on popular cultures that are not included within the recognized canons. It also adopts the critical pedagogy that feeds on comparative and reflective practices for the sake of fostering cultural awareness of the world. Apparently, digital education and the ample opportunities initiated by social media and the various forms of Information Communication Technology (ICT) allow for connecting English learners with speakers of English from other cultures, a possibility that is absent in the ordinary reality experienced in English as Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. Based on these premises, the present research article argues for enhancing intercultural competence among Moroccan university students of English as a viable strategy to overcome the remarkable low achievement in exam scores and language proficiency. It posits that students' expectation vis-\u00e0-vis the learning and teaching materials are not adequately met. Furthermore, it both predicts and confirms that students have a strong predilection for cultural integration in their English studies. As students have positive attitudes of ICTs, especially social media, the article proposes blending the traditional classroom mode of teaching with the cooperative and collaborative online learning practices. To face the inevitable challenges to this suggestion, it is recommended that the teachers should be engaged in preservice and in-service training in the content and the methodology of such blended learning that targets intercultural competence improvement.",

There is a strong need for both researchers and educators to be aware of adult learners' attitudes toward English mobile learning, yet relevant studies on mobile learning to promote English learning for adult learners are scarce. The purpose of this study was to describe the development of an English Mobile Learning attitude scale for adult learners in higher education. A preliminary version of a scale to measure attitudes toward English mobile learning was developed and piloted on 190 adult learners who were attending the continuing education situations in Southern Taiwan. Initial item selection produced a pilot scale consisting of 36 Likert items. Subsequently, an expert review panel, item analysis, and factor analysis revealed four structurally independent attitude constructs and justified retention of 21 of the original items. The full instrument was found to have both a high internal reliability coefficient (0.93) and significant construct validity (p &lt; 0.001).",

    "description": "Feedback plays an important role in the student learning process as it gives the learners greater insight into what they have actually done to arrive at an outcome. The importance of providing learners with feedback during the learning process comes from the fact that it highlights the difference between the intended outcome and the actual outcome, as well as the learners' strengths and areas for improvement, thus providing a drive for change. However, providing learners with effective feedback is challenging in online settings where the physical absence of the instructor and the restrictive nature of most available online learning platforms can create a barrier to giving the appropriate feedback to the learners. In this article, I propose a freely available online technology that can be of great help to educators who teach online courses. I first review literature on the aspects that affect the quality of feedback and then demonstrate how providing e-feedback through screencast technology can positively enhance the effectiveness of feedback provided electronically in online settings. I will shed light on an empirical study conducted by the researcher in which he provided e-feedback in the form of screencasts in an online English as a Foreign Language (EFL) course with undergraduate students (n = 87) at a British University and measured the impact of each type of feedback on the learning process and learning outcomes. Toward the end of the article, I put forth my recommendations for the best use of e-feedback technologies in any online educational setting in general, and in a language classroom in particular.",

This study examines participant perspectives on group dynamics, and how comradery and a foreign language guide affect participants' in-game production of L2 German while playing World of Warcraft (WoW) as an extramural activity. This study focuses on an eight-week long MMOG gaming project, in which two groups of participants played WoW with a native German speaker in order to investigate the effects inter-group dynamics have on a participant's real-time target language production and willingness to communicate. Participants reported during interviews and written journal entries that a lack of shared interests and motivation (learning and gaming) negatively affected the groups' target language participation. The findings additionally suggest that a trained foreign language instructor paired with a motivated learner may result in increased participation; however, these increases may be temporary if a group's relationship does not extend beyond the shared goal of foreign language improvement.",

They have received little formal English instruction: two lessons per week for one year. Data on EE-habits were collected with a one-week language diary (self-report with parental guidance). Participants reported minutes spent each day on seven EE-activities: gaming, listening to music, reading, talking, watching television, writing, and other. Vocabulary proficiency scores were obtained using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT\u2122-4). The results show that most time was spent on gaming, music, and watching television. Boys gamed significantly more (p &lt; 0.001) than girls (235 minutes/week vs. 47 minutes/week). Additionally, the results show that gaming with both oral and written English input and gaming with only written English input are significantly related to vocabulary scores, in particular for boys. By investigating the EE-habits of YELLs and relations with second language (L2) English vocabulary learning, this study adds valuable new insights and knowledge about a topic that is becoming increasingly important for children in a globalized world.",

    "description": "Technology-mediated task-based language teaching is the merger between technology and task-based language teaching (TBLT; Gonz\u00e1lez-Lloret &amp; Ortega, 2014) and is arguably now an imperative for language education. As language classrooms are being redefined, training for how to set learners up to successfully do tasks online must be part of teachers' professional development. However, while multiple resources have been written on tasks, technology, and task-based language courses online (e.g., Chapelle, 2014; Doughty &amp; Long, 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-Lloret, 2016; Nielson, Gonz\u00e1lez-Lloret, &amp; Pinckney, 2009; Thomas &amp; Reinders, 2012), teacher training for this purpose has largely been ignored. To date, no methodological guide for how to do TBLT via online video interactive tutorials has been published for teachers. In this article, we address this need by proposing a methodology framework for doing TBLT online. We begin with a brief review of TBLT fundamentals and demonstrate how to adapt the Willis (1996, 2012) task-based methodology framework for synchronous, online video-based interaction. We describe the framework and show examples of how to apply it while fostering socialization and community building (Hampel &amp; Stickler, 2005). We also discuss unique challenges that teachers face when doing TBLT online, and propose solutions for how these can be overcome to maximize language learning.",

This is achieved by an analysis of 53 corpusbased projects prepared by the participants. First, the aims and the design of the course are briefly presented. The main section of the article examines the trainees' projects, which involved compiling small English for specific purposes corpora, analysing them and preparing corpus-based lessons. Specifically, the topics of the projects, the corpora that the participants built, the types of the analyses conducted, and the corpus-informed and corpus-based activities created by the trainees are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The projects' outcomes reveal that the competencies developed by the pre-service teachers during the course were not sufficient. The participants seemed to have mastered only the basic technical skills of manipulating corpora, and they lacked autonomy in corpus-linguistic skills and pedagogical skills which were necessary for successful exploitations of corpora in language education. This observation--supported by earlier research--calls for the development and empirical validation of a model of effective teacher training in corpus-informed and corpus-based instruction.",

Each session contained a pre-test, a 30-minute training, and a post-test, and each training session focused on one of the three key writing points: articles, collocations, and paraphrasing. Two questionnaires for demographic information and GST learning experiences were conducted. The results showed a statistically significant effect for the overall gain score. In particular, participants' use of articles greatly improved after the training--in contrast to their use of collocations and paraphrasing. Lack of grammar and vocabulary knowledge seemed to hinder their data-driven learning, especially for collocation use and paraphrasing. The questionnaire data showed that all students found the GSTs beneficial, mostly because they were easy to use for confirmation and correction. Overall, both quantitative and qualitative data suggest that teachers' meticulous guidance and vigilant individualized feedback are necessary to facilitate L2 self-directed Google-informed writing.",

    "description": "Although data collection has been used in language learning settings for some time, it is only in recent decades that large corpora have become available, along with efficient tools for their use. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled rich tagging and annotation of corpus data, essential for their effective use in language acquisition applications. Corpus consultation by both teachers and learners has become more common, most often through the use of concordance software that shows word and expression search results in context. Corpus use integrates well into constructivist and learner-centered approaches to language acquisition. It supports the mandate in contemporary communicative language instruction for the use of authentic language materials and for the development in learners of metalinguistic knowledge and learner autonomy. At the same time, the prominence of formulaic and patterned language in spoken discourse, as demonstrated by the analysis of captured corpus data, has led to an &quot;explosion of activity&quot; (Gablasova, Brezina, &amp; McEnery, 2017, p. 156) in research and language instruction related to language chunks (recurring word patterns). In this article, the author discusses authenticity and &quot;real&quot; language in corpora, corpus use in instruction (direct and indirect approaches), guided induction, learner corpora, small and learner-created corpora, and finally, access to corpora and tools.",

    "description": "As a nation of immigrants with diverse cultures and nationalities, one of the most striking occurrences in the United States educational system is the rapidly increasing enrollment of English Language Learners (ELLs). In view of their multicultural backgrounds, the multiliteracies education of ELLs is intertwined with their diverse socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic, and ethnic backgrounds, as well as their technological experiences. This 4-week research implemented an instrumental case study approach using funds of knowledge (FoK; see Gonz\u00e1lez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005) to explore the learning effects of scaffolding young ELLs' narrative writing skills through the use of tablet computers (iPads) and a digital handwriting app (Penultimate). Research findings showed that ELLs' learning motivation and quality of narrative writing abilities were enhanced through the use of this mobile technology. The culture-based writing topics based on FoK mirrored the ELLs' multicultural backgrounds and provided ELL teachers a creative way to incorporate students' prior knowledge into their English as second language learning through a culture-based instructional model. Parents also played a potential role in young ELLs' mobile-assisted language learning. Future studies should be directed toward extending multiliteracies curricula through FoK to actively engage ELLs in narrative writing activities through the use of emerging mobile technology.",

    "author": "Ballance, Oliver James",
    "description": "One of the most promising avenues of research in computer-assisted language learning is the potential for language learners to make use of language corpora. However, using a corpus requires use of a corpus tool as an interface, typically a concordancer. How such a tool can be made most accessible to learners is an important issue. Specifically, there have been suggestions that language learners should not be following corpus linguistic patterns of concordance use when using concordancers. As such, it is important to examine the extent to which there are different prototypical orientations to concordance use, orientations that can provide models of use for learners to follow. This paper reports a study that provides empirical evidence of correlations between different classifications of concordance user and concordancing preferences. It derives factor scores from a factor analysis of 181 concordance users and uses a series of MANOVA tests to identify statistically significant differences between these scores for different classifications of the respondents. The main dimensions of these differences are then explored through discriminant function analysis. The analyses reveal correlations between different levels of three of the four criteria users were classified by: frequency of concordance use, language of concordance use and field of concordance use. The results suggest two main models of concordance use marked by different concordancing preferences: analysis type concordance use and reference type concordance use.",

    "description": "This exploratory review brings together research that investigates computer-assisted language learning (CALL), and research in the field of learning design, paying particular attention to the theoretical frameworks and approaches of &quot;design for learning.&quot; The attempts of connecting the two fields stem from two critical foci and commitments of &quot;design for learning&quot;: (1) on the contemporary &quot;learning context&quot; which has become increasingly learner-centred and technology-rich and (2) on the &quot;learning process&quot; which is, now widely recognised and accepted, constantly evolving, configurative, dynamic and complex. &quot;Design for learning&quot; asserts that technology-enhanced learning (TEL) could only be partly designed; the other part--the learning process--is emerging and created through the actions of participants in the learning networks. Therefore, the ecology and architecture of a learning network become the focus of investigation. This author argues that &quot;design for learning,&quot; which is firmly grounded in the contemporary theories of learning, merits being seriously looked at by CALL. A preliminarily synthesis of the two fields is presented, which signals potential synergies. The synergies will broaden the understanding of CALL and strengthen its design.",

Educational online tools, like the present e-forum, have received much less attention. Initially, I intended to answer three research questions: (i) Is phatic talk used in a transactional task? If so, what function(s) does it perform?, (ii) Is phatic talk affected by being computer-mediated rather than face-to-face? If so, in what ways? and (iii) How may an intercultural setting affect computer-mediated phatic talk? Results are preliminary but show that, despite the transactional character of the task, the students paid close attention to phatic communication as an essential way to build rapport and foster their collaboration as a group.",

First, task analysis helped identify skills important for listening comprehension in academic settings. Aspects analysed included the purpose of assessment tasks, skills/constructs assessed, and task stimuli employed in PTE Academic. The findings indicated that modern technologies enabled PTE Academic, a computer-based test, to assess students' academic listening abilities in real time using the integration of multi-modal sources. The statistical validation consisted of two stages. Exploratory factor analysis was performed first with a sample of over 5000 students who took PTE Academic, to examine the underlying listening constructs as measured by the scores on the 11 item types item on different listening skills; these scores were subjected to Rasch analysis using CONQUEST. Second, the difficulties of the item types were estimated and the effectiveness of these item types was evaluated by calculating the information function by item type. The study has implications for test developers and test users regarding the interpretation of student performance on listening assessments.",

However, literature is scarce on foreign language learners' beliefs toward computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in general. To narrow this gap, we investigated the constructs that compose a system of language learners' beliefs toward CALL at a large U.S. university and examined whether the amount of technology used and the target language (TL) play a role in shaping learners' beliefs. The findings of this large-scale survey of 2,061 students studying nineteen different TLs indicate four factors comprising learners' belief systems toward CALL in this context: efficacy of technology for language learning and its connection to motivation, satisfaction with technology used in the learners' classes, specific benefits of technology, and the importance of computer skills and technical support. Learners' CALL beliefs were more positive when they had had more exposure to technology in their classes, but this varied based on the TL. Higher use of technology outside of class resulted in more positive beliefs across the board, independent of the TL. The pedagogical implications are that greater exposure to effective and varied models of CALL might result in more positive beliefs toward it.",

(d) What do FL student teachers report they believe about their teacher preparation in CALL? Data from 71 respondents suggest FL student teachers do not feel well prepared to use CALL technologies pedagogically and that they have a limited repertoire of technology resources. Approximately 87.5% of these student teachers self-report their knowledge of CALL technologies as novice or intermediate. This article examines the virtues and shortcomings of FL student teachers' preparation and use of CALL, offering suggestions for FL teacher education.",

Our findings reveal that the participants developed a partnership based on reciprocity and membership within the eTandem community, which contributed to their identity construction and L2 learning. These findings shed light on the affordances of eTandem as a meaningful and productive L2 learning environment and suggest a further examination of the relationship between L2 learners' identity construction and eTandem learning.",

Students from two intact sections of second-semester French were tested on their listening comprehension before and after a four-week learning phase during which the treatment group received listening instruction via audiovisual materials while the control group completed a different listening task that did not involve audiovisual materials. Results from the pretest indicated that the two groups began the study at a nearly identical level of listening ability. The experimental group subsequently increased its listening proficiency in the immediate and delayed posttests, achieving considerably higher scores when compared to the control group. While the difference in scores on the posttests was not significant, effect sizes suggested a positive outcome for the experimental group. This study represents a preliminary indication that activities using online audiovisual materials may have a positive impact on the acquisition of listening comprehension skills.",

    "author": "Scholz, Kyle",
    "description": "Massively multiplayer online role-playing games like World of Warcraft are ideally suited to encourage and facilitate second language development (SLD) in the extramural setting, but to what extent do the language learners' actual trajectories of gameplay contribute to SLD? With the current propensity to focus research in digital game-based language learning on vernacular games, or commercially available games that are designed with entertainment in mind, it is vital to focus on the extramural setting in which these games are designed to be played, while still being subject to rigorous and empirical analysis. This article examines the extramural gameplay and language-learning trajectories of four university German-language learners as they play World of Warcraft with native German speakers. Positioning learners' experiences within a complex adaptive systems framework (Larsen-Freeman &amp; Cameron, 2008; de Bot &amp; Larsen-Freeman, 2011), the change that each learner undergoes while playing the game over the course of four months is explored in detail. Understanding the game environment as an affinity space (Gee, 2005) helps to substantiate how a game, independent of instructor guidance or classroom intervention, can still promote SLD amongst language learners of varying experiences and proficiencies. The results of this study suggest that numerous factors influence the success of a language learner's extramural gameplay experience, but that these factors must be analyzed in conjunction with the emergent internal and external resources of the complex adaptive system as language learners play and interact with other players in a context removed from the traditional classroom.",

    "author": "S\u00e1nchez-Castro, Olga, Strambi, Antonella",
    "description": "This study explores the potential contribution of Eggins and Slade's (2004) Speech Functions as tools for describing learners' participation patterns in Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC). Our analysis focuses on the relationship between learners' self-efficacy (i.e. personal judgments of second language performance capabilities) and discourse roles displayed in the online medium. A small corpus of data was selected as a sample from a larger study, comprising one face-to-face interaction (FtF2) and one synchronous text-based chat interaction (SCMC2) between two participants: Celine, a high-self-efficacy (HSE) learner, and Concetta, a low-self-efficacy (LSE) learner. The chat-log and conversation transcript were analyzed by employing: (a) quantitative measures of participation; namely words and turns produced by the participants, (b) D\u00f6rnyei and Kormos's (1998) taxonomy of Communication Strategies, and (c) Eggins and Slade's (2004) classification of speech functions. Our results suggest that speech functions are indeed effective at describing the social roles enacted by learners during interaction across the two media, in terms of discourse dependence or independence, as well as dominance. Therefore, by complementing other methods, such as quantitative measures of participation and qualitative analyses of communication strategies, speech functions can contribute to providing a comprehensive picture of the relationship between SCMC, learners' self-efficacy, and participation patterns.",

    "author": "Ortega, Lourdes",
    "description": "The majority of the world is multilingual, but inequitably multilingual, and much of the world is also technologized, but inequitably so. Thus, researchers in the fields of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and second language acquisition (SLA) would profit from considering multilingualism and social justice when envisioning new CALL-SLA interfaces for the future. I first explain the connection I see among multilingualism, digital literacy, and social justice, and I characterize contemporary SLA as transformed by a social turn that is now complete, a bilingual turn slowly underway, and a social justice turn emerging on the horizon. I then review empirical evidence that suggests digital communication encourages multilingual practices, helps users appreciate the open nature of language resources, and perhaps even supports positive multilingual ideologies. Next I offer some illustrations of possible new research questions and CALL-SLA studies that would focus on embracing and exploiting the openness of language resources in language learning, and on doing multilingual learning. Finally, I examine what we know about the digital divide that is relevant to CALL-SLA researchers. I close with a checklist for researchers interested in contributing to these new research interfaces in support of equitable multilingualism in online and offline language learning and teaching.",

    "author": "Kusyk, Meryl",
    "description": "Research into the online informal learning of English (OILE) examines how nonnative speakers of English may develop L2 skills through participation in leisure activities on the Internet in the target language. Such activities include, e.g., watching television series, films, or videos, interacting on Facebook, reading articles, or listening to music. Recent OILE studies have focused on students at French universities and have sought to both inventory language users' online participation habits and track their L2 development (Kusyk &amp; Sockett, 2012; Sockett, 2011, 2014; Sockett &amp; Kusyk, 2015; Toffoli &amp; Sockett, 2015). This article provides updated OILE participation data on French students and, for the first time, German university students. In order to increase awareness about current OILE practices, results of a questionnaire (N = 953) of OILE habits are presented. In addition, development in complexity, accuracy, and fluency of three individual study participants was tracked over a period of five months. Results show a great deal of inter- and intraindividual variation, highlighting the need to consider L2 development as a complex and nonlinear process, especially when analyzed within an online, informal context.",

    "author": "Rodgers, Michael P. H., Webb, Stuart",
    "description": "The Multimedia Principle (Fletcher &amp; Tobias, 2005) states that people learn better and comprehend more when words and pictures are presented together. The potential for English language learners to increase their comprehension of video through the use of captions, which graphically display the same language as the spoken dialogue, has been documented in previous research. However, studies have generally used short videos (Markham &amp; Peter, 2003; Montero Perez, Peters, &amp; Desmet, 2014) or videos designed for language learning (Chung, 1999) rather than episodes of L2 television programs that students are most likely to watch on their own outside of the classroom. The present study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the comprehension of 372 Japanese university students who watched ten 42-minute episodes of an American television program with and without captions. While viewing the episodes, the participants completed comprehension tests. Analysis indicated that although the participants who viewed the episodes with captions had comprehension scores that were slightly higher across all episodes, their scores were only significantly different for three of the ten episodes. The results revealed that captions are likely to aid comprehension when episodes are most difficult. Explanations for the findings and pedagogical applications are offered.",

    "description": "The present study incorporates a student response system (SRS) as a means to engage students in a flipped classroom and promote active learning. While the effectiveness of such systems with regard to student learning has been well documented in disciplines that are dominated by lecture-based instruction, no studies have compared the effectiveness of SRS-integrated flipped classrooms in English language teaching contexts, as supported by the two different techniques of just-in-time teaching (JiTT) and peer instruction (PI). This study thus aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining the effects of SRS-integrated flipped classrooms on English language learners' speaking skills, willingness to communicate, and satisfaction with the flipped learning experiences. Using a quasi-experimental design, the overall results indicate that SRS-integrated flipped classrooms are capable of providing interactive learning opportunities that enhance learners' willingness to communicate, aiding their development of speaking skills and increasing their satisfaction with such learning experiences. The findings further suggest that the proposed approach has an additional advantage for motivating learners with low willingness to communicate to interact with the teacher and their peers in class activities, especially when facilitated by the PI technique.",

    "author": "Warner, Chantelle, Chen, Hsin-I",
    "description": "The easy accessibility, ubiquity, and plurilingualism of popular SNSs such as Facebook have inspired many scholars and practitioners of second language teaching and learning to integrate networked forms of communication into educational contexts such as language classrooms and study abroad programs (e.g., Blattner &amp; Fiori, 2011; Lamy &amp; Zourou, 2013; Mills, 2011; Reinhardt &amp; Ryu, 2013; Reinhardt &amp; Zander, 2011). At the same time, the complex and dynamic patterns of interaction that emerge in these spaces quickly push back upon standard ways of describing conversational genres and communicative competence (Kern, 2014; Lotherington &amp; Ronda, 2014). Drawing from an ecological interactional analysis (Goffman, 1964, 1981a, 1981b, 1986; Kramsch &amp; Whiteside, 2008) of the Facebook communications of three German-speaking academics whose social and professional lives are largely led in English, the authors consider the kinds of symbolic maneuvers required to participate in the translingual conversational flows of SNS-mediated communication. Based on this analysis, this article argues that texts generated through SNS-mediated communication can provide classroom opportunities for critical, stylistically sensitive reflection on the nature of talk in line with multiliteracies approaches.",

    "description": "Due to demographic changes, there is a growing number of adolescent students who learn in classrooms in which their teacher and peers come from cultural and linguistic backgrounds that are different from theirs. In these diverse classrooms, teachers need to be able to facilitate language learning spaces that are welcoming for all children, regardless of their backgrounds. Considering this need, the purpose of this study is to examine how 11 teachers, acting as language mentors of 11 high school English learners, demonstrated intercultural communication and cultural responsiveness during their participation in a 10-week telecollaboration project. To this end, online interactions and the teacher mentors' weekly reflection journals were analyzed. From these analyses, three highly productive relationships were selected and their interactions were analyzed to better understand teachers' approaches to intercultural communication and cultural responsiveness and the role that the identities of teachers and students displayed in both processes. The study findings show that teachers who displayed an online identity as friends or as joint learners offered student mentees the opportunity to lead the conversation, to be recognized as they wanted to be recognized online, and to participate in learning tasks that reflected and engaged them. This study highlights the different needs of adolescent English learners, the complexity of their identities, and the importance of English teachers' dispositions to be humble and open to learn about both.",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "From its earliest days, practitioners of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) have collected data from computer-mediated learning environments. Indeed, that has been a central aspect of the field from the beginning. Usage logs provided valuable insights into how systems were used and how effective they were for language learning. That information could be analyzed to improve instructional design and delivery. Maintaining learning histories and personal profiles of individual learners enabled a program to adapt the delivery of learning materials to the record of student performance. Given a limited number of users working within a single system, the data generated could be collected and analyzed easily, using simple methods and tools such as spreadsheets and basic data models. The situation today is quite different from that scenario. Learners are likely to be using multiple online tools and services, all of which may be recording data. That includes general use software and services such as Facebook and Google, as well as mobile devices. If they are university students, they are likely to be generating data points through a learning management system (LMS) as well as from other university-level systems. The vast amount of information collected today from our use of online tools and services provides a huge storehouse of information that can be mined to provide both general usage trends and individualized reports. This &quot;big data&quot; offers valuable teaching and learning insights. In this column, we will be looking at what this may mean in language learning. That will include discussion of the emerging field of learning analytics, the use of learner models, and the opportunities afforded by data tracking for personalized learning.",

    "description": "The current paper reports an empirical study of asynchronous online group review of argumentative essays among nine English as foreign language (EFL) Arab university learners joining English in their first, second, and third years at the institution. In investigating online interactions, commenting patterns, and how the students facilitate text revisions, a three-level analysis of learners' comments in terms of the language functions, nature and focus area, and connections to subsequent text revisions was conducted. The learners produced a number of 1,792 comments which were exploratory, including scaffolding and non-scaffolding (72%), procedural (11%), and social (17%) comments. In relation to the nature and focus area, 53% of the exploratory comments were revision-oriented comments--focusing on global (n = 799; 84%) and local (n = 149; 16%) issues of learners' essays--whereas non-revision-oriented comments (47%) focused on learners' socio-relational space (74%), task management (23%) and technical challenges (3%). The findings also showed that 46% of the overall global (n = 615) and only 10% of the overall local (n = 838) text revisions were connected to learners' comments, indicating the value of global oriented comments in facilitating learners' global text revisions. Differences of occurrence of these commenting patterns among the three groups were found. Such findings suggest that global text revisions need to be modelled by instructors.",

    "description": "The increasingly widespread use of social software (e.g., Wikis, Google Docs) in second language (L2) settings has brought a renewed attention to collaborative writing. Although the current methodological approaches to examining collaborative writing are valuable to understand L2 students' interactional patterns or perceived experiences, they can be insufficient to capture the quantity and quality of writing in networked online environments. Recently, the evolution of techniques for analyzing big data has transformed many areas of life, from information search to marketing. However, the use of data and text mining for understanding writing processes in language learning contexts is largely underexplored. In this article, we synthesize the current methodological approaches to researching collaborative writing and discuss how new text mining tools can enhance research capacity. These advanced methods can help researchers to elucidate collaboration processes by analyzing user behaviors (e.g., amount of editing, participation equality) and their link to writing outcomes across large numbers of exemplars. We introduce key research examples to illustrate this potential and discuss the implications of integrating the tools for L2 collaborative writing research and pedagogy.",

    "description": "Recent research in digital game-based language learning has been encouraging, yet it would benefit from research methods that focus on the gaming processes and second-language development (Larsen-Freeman, 2015) rather than learner/player reflection or individuals' beliefs about the validity of gameplay. This has proven challenging as research methods which provide insight into the gameplay experiences and its many factors are needed. Having the gameplay experience occur extramurally is desirable, but makes the direct observation of the learners' activities by a researcher difficult. For this reason, we suggest approaching digital game-based language learning through complex adaptive systems research (Larsen-Freeman &amp; Cameron, 2008a) and employing D\u00f6rnyei's (2014) retrodictive qualitative modeling to capture the complex synchronic and diachronic variability of the learners and their individual nonlinear gaming trajectories with requisite data density and over a considerable period of time. This article draws on a study examining language learners playing the online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; over four months. We will focus on the data collection in this observational study and the methods of analysis of a complex adaptive system, which helped to better understand the role of extramural digital gaming for the purpose of second-language development.",

    "description": "Second language (L2) request production has long been a central area of inquiry in interlanguage pragmatics, including how L2 learners mitigate their requests and whether such strategies correspond to or differ from those of first language (L1) speakers. Methodologically, such research often involves elicited speech and tends to isolate the speech act from the surrounding discourse using instruments such as discourse completion tasks. While some naturalistic speech contexts (e.g., academic advising sessions) have been investigated, few studies to date have analyzed requesting in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC). The current study responds by presenting a multifactorial analysis of L1 and L2 request production that occurred during eight one-hour web conferences between L2 learners of German for professional purposes and L1 German professionals. Three taxonomies traditionally used in face-to-face pragmatics research were adapted for analysis of the SCMC, enabling the use of a generalized linear mixed model. Findings indicate that while both groups of speakers used predominantly direct requesting behavior, L1 speakers used significantly more internal modification devices than did L2 learners.",

    "description": "Computer-mediated communication (CMC) once meant principally text-based communication mediated by computers, but rapid technological advances in recent years have heralded an era of multimodal communication with a growing emphasis on audio and video synchronous interaction. As CMC, in all its variants (text chats, video chats, forums, blogs, SMS, etc.), has become normalized practice in personal and professional lives, educational initiatives, particularly language teaching and learning, are following suit. For researchers interested in exploring learner interactions in complex technology-supported learning environments, new challenges inevitably emerge. This article looks at the challenges of transcribing and representing multimodal data (visual, oral, and textual) when engaging in computer-assisted language learning research. When transcribing and representing such data, the choices made depend very much on the specific research questions addressed, hence in this paper we explore these challenges through discussion of a specific case study where the researchers were seeking to explore the emergence of identity through interaction in an online, multimodal situated space. Given the limited amount of literature addressing the transcription of online multimodal communication, it is felt that this article is a timely contribution to researchers interested in exploring interaction in CMC language and intercultural learning environments.",

The CBMCAs involved a combination of writing, listening, visual analysis, and speaking activities. The research was framed within an integrated theoretical framework of multimodality, the noticing hypothesis, and the multi-dimensional model of revision. Data include surveys, students' revision history, online multimodal posters, reflections, screen recordings of listening activities, stimulated recall interviews, final written drafts, and scores on those drafts. Data collection and analysis followed a descriptive case study design with embedded quantitative data. Findings indicate that CBMCAs helped students discover specific rhetorical and linguistic elements that they used to revise their written drafts. In addition, students reported that the activities helped them develop language and voice to convey ideas that they were struggling to express using the written mode alone. Contrary to findings in most previous research, the students did more content-level than surface-level revisions. Also, there was a significant correlation between total frequency of revision and text quality. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings for L2 writing pedagogy and research are discussed.",

    "description": "Behaviour-tracking technology has been used for decades in SLA research on focused practice with an eye toward elucidating the nature of L2 automatization (e.g. DeKeyser, 1997; Robinson, 1997). This involves longitudinally capturing learners' judgments or linguistic production along with their response times in order to investigate how specific skills become automatic over time. However, previous research in this area has been conducted mostly in laboratories (i.e., in vitro), sometimes with artificial languages, thereby compromising ecological validity of the findings. Building on this work, this article reports on a one-month study in which learners' (N = 126) behaviour was tracked while they practised two constructions of English grammar (varying in complexity) using mini-games that involved some time pressure and were embedded in meaning-focused reading and discussion activities in class. Feedback was randomly varied between participants. Multilevel statistical analyses of accuracy and response time suggest that practice helped to develop automaticity, and that rule complexity and metalinguistic feedback played a role. The methodological innovation of this study consists of the application of in vitro experimental research techniques in in vivo L2 learning contexts and of the use of statistical mixed effects models to account for the complexity of real-life tracking data.",

Group A demonstrated a collective pattern in Task 1, but switched to an active-withdrawn pattern in Task 2. In contrast, Group B exhibited a dominant-defensive pattern in Task 1, but switched to a collaborative pattern in Task 2. These patterns were substantiated by group members' ongoing task approaches in terms of equality and mutuality, reflected via the analyses of language functions, writing change functions, and scaffolding occurrences over the course of joint wiki writing. The dynamic interactions within small groups were explained from a sociocultural theory perspective. Participants' emic perspectives from interviews and reflection papers supplemented with wiki discourse revealed that three sociocultural factors help account for the variations of interaction patterns: dynamic goals, flexible agency, and socially constructed emotion. This study reinforced the role of sociocultural theory in exploring and explaining peer interactions in the online writing task environment. Implications of the study for research and pedagogy are also discussed.",

(2014), the current study follows up to explore the nature of the students' (N = 25) interactions during the text chat activities to determine potential sources of the gains. All 18 activities developed for the study encouraged interaction to complete tasks in pairs. A detailed coding of 169 text chat transcripts examined instances of peer-peer interactions. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses explored whether and to what extent real-time interactive language tasks foster the kinds of language-related moves that may support greater language learning. Results show that students spontaneously engaged in various behaviors which may support language learning, such as providing language-related assistance (self- and peer-correction, negotiation for meaning), using their partner as a resource (for clarifying information, modeling language use, or helping with unknown vocabulary), and providing encouragement (responding positively to the task and to each other, eliciting information from a partner). The most frequent instances were of positive affect, self-correction, and partner correction.

    "description": "This is an empirical study in which we explore child foreign language learners' interactional strategy use, uptake, and lexical acquisition in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC). The study was carried out with 16 10-year-old Spanish English as a foreign language learners paired with age- and proficiency-matched English native speaker peers who worked together over a 5-week period on three communicative jigsaw tasks. Results show that during text-based SCMC, the children negotiated for meaning in ways that coincided with and differed from studies of young learners' face-to-face communication. Successful uptake of target lexis occurred infrequently despite high rates of negotiation, although the children's lexical knowledge improved significantly over time. Analyses of the chat scripts revealed that the learners noticed and retained additional lexical items embedded in the task and used during the interaction. They had not been the focus of negotiation, but were useful for task completion. Participation in SCMC also raised the children's awareness of gaps in their lexical knowledge and stimulated their attempts to fill those gaps outside the classroom. The results are discussed and implications suggested for implementing SCMC in instructional settings.",

    "author": "Turner, Robert L., III",
    "description": "This study attempts to ascertain if the WebCAPE placement exam can be used to measure improvement in an upper division grammar course. The WebCAPE online placement exam is a widely used instrument designed to help university language programs place students into the basic language course best corresponding to their proficiency level. This is done through computerized adaptive language testing optimized for students in the first four semesters of basic language instruction. In this study the researcher employed this placement exam in the context of an advanced Spanish grammar class. The study revealed that the WebCAPE produces statistically significant results when correlated to final grade, test average, and the second administration of the placement exam at the end of the semester. However, the effect sizes for the predictive elements were small. It was further observed that for participants who initially placed above the recommended cut-off for higher than third semester Spanish, there was a moderately negative correlation between initial placement score and class performance. It is speculated that the nature of the placement exam produces a ceiling effect that reduces its placement value for classes beyond basic Spanish.",

    "author": "Slavuj, Vanja, Me\u0161trovic, Ana, Kovacic, Bo\u017eidar",
    "description": "Adaptive and intelligent instructional systems are used to deal with the issue of learning personalisation in contexts where human instructors are not immediately available, so their role is transferred entirely or in part onto the computer. Even though such systems are mostly developed for well-defined domains that have a rather straightforward acquisition order, such as mathematics or computer programming, they found their application in ill-defined domains as well. Natural language learning is one such domain, and developing adaptive instructional systems for this specific purpose is notoriously complex and challenging due to the nature of language systems. The paper at hand examines the theoretical background of adaptivity and intelligence in instructional systems, and discusses their application in learning and teaching of natural languages. Moreover, the paper reviews adaptive and intelligent language learning systems in existence and identifies their characteristics in a systematic manner. The discussion section offers a more detailed view of selected systems for language learning that exhibit interesting and innovative implementation solutions. The paper concludes by suggesting possible developmental directions and future work in the field.",

In fact, only three programs have a requirement for a technology course specific to SM. To aid in the adoption of software and information technology into SM programs, we researched software systems that may provide skills to enhance the various components of SM. In an effort to make our recommendations even more meaningful, we pair specific software programs and their attributes with particular courses in SM. Moreover, we consider the common professional component requirements of the SM accrediting body Commission on Sport Management Accreditation and make suggestions as to how our software discoveries might aid colleges and universities in meeting accreditation requirements.",

    "description": "This article investigates the role of direct corpus use in learners' collocational competence in academic writing. An experiment was conducted between two groups of Chinese postgraduates who had no previous knowledge of corpora. It was embedded in a regular 4-month linguistics course in the students' programmes, where a corpus-assisted method was used for the experimental group and a traditional, or rule-based, method was used for the control group. The English essays written by these two groups of learners from different time periods (before, immediately after, and two months after the course) were analysed regarding the learners' collocational use--in particular, verb-preposition collocations. The results reveal that while both groups showed improvements in their academic writing, the students in the experimental group displayed a significant improvement in the use of collocations, including a higher rate of accuracy, or naturalness, and an increased use of academic collocations and fixed phraseological items. It is thus concluded that the knowledge and use of corpora can help students raise their awareness of habitual collocational use and develop their collocational competence. This supports the positive role of direct corpus application in an EFL context.",

    "description": "This study analyses the effects of data-driven learning (DDL) on the phraseology used by 223 English students at an Italian university. The students studied the genre of opinion survey reports through paper-based and hands-on exploration of a reference corpus. They then wrote their own report and a learner corpus of these texts was compiled. A contrastive interlanguage analysis approach (Granger, 2002) was adopted to compare the phraseology of key items in the learner corpus with that found in the reference corpus. Comparison is also made with a learner corpus of reports produced by a previous cohort of students who had not used the reference corpus. Students who had done DDL tasks used a wider range of genre-appropriate phraseology and produced a lower number of stock phrases than those who had not. The study also finds evidence that students use more phrases encountered in paper-based concordancing tasks than in hands-on tasks. Unlike in previous DDL studies, observations of the learning of a specific text-type through DDL in the present study are based on the comparison with both a control learner corpus and an expert corpus. The study also considers the use of DDL with a large class size.",

    "description": "The present study investigates the effects of two different vocabulary learning conditions in digital reading environments equipped with electronic textual glossing. The first condition presents the concordance lines of a target lexical item, thereby making learners infer its meaning by reading the referenced sentences. The second condition additionally offers the definition of a target lexical item after learners consult the concordance lines, thus enabling learners to confirm their meaning inference. A total of 138 English as a Foreign Language students completed a meaning-recall vocabulary pre-test, and three different reading tasks, which were followed by meaning-recall vocabulary post-tests in a repeated measures design with a control condition. Overall, the findings showed that the second condition resulted in higher vocabulary gains than both the first condition and the control condition. Yet, a closer look at the interactions of (a) the participants' clicking behaviors, (b) the difficulty of selected concordance lines, (c) the surrounding contexts around target lexical items, and (d) the participants' prior knowledge of the target lexical items showed that each target lexical item may require different treatments for it to be recalled most efficiently and effectively. Through this investigation, the present study suggests that glossary information, such as concordance lines, may involve more complex and unexpected learner interactions.",

One hundred and fifty-two texts generated by 38 graduate students within the context of the same Master's level course were analysed using Coh-Metrix indices at the surface code, textbase and situation model levels. The two text types differed in their lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, use of cohesion and agency. Overall, the traditional course assignments were more formal, lexically sophisticated and syntactically complex, while the blog posts contained more semantic and situational redundancy, resulting in higher readability, and communicated a clearer sense of agency. There were also reliable differences between the textual artefacts generated by the L1 and L2 writers, one of which was a more traditional impersonal academic style of the L2 texts. Although no interaction was observed between the two independent variables in the Coh-Metrix analyses, an additional analysis of human ratings showed that the blog posts were rated lower on the use of language than traditional assignments for the L2, but not L1, writers. Limitations of the computational text analysis and pedagogical implications of the findings are considered.",

The goals of the study are (a) to present empirical data that illustrate the theoretical construct of affordance in a virtual, collaborative reading environment, and (b) to investigate the pedagogical ramifications of using a digital annotation tool to involve learners in collaborative reading. Three distinct types of affordances emerged in the data: linguistic, literary, and social affordances. Our findings indicate that the number of literary and social affordances outnumbered the linguistic affordances that emerged in students' threaded discussions while collaboratively reading and annotating poems. In addition, the primary challenges for learners when engaging in collaborative reading included others' comments impeding some students' understanding of the text, and having to make one's comments distinct from others' comments to avoid being socially viewed as an inactive reader or student. From a pedagogical perspective, the primary benefits of incorporating collaborative reading in a second language poetry course involve the ability to establish a more open learning community and allowing students to carry out a closer reading of literary texts.",

Whatever those may be, they are not likely to have the same impact that the release of the original iPhone had 10 years ago. That event led to a radical new vision for the design and capability of mobile devices. Within a short period of time, there was an industry shake-up, with Windows and Blackberry phones, the erstwhile smartphone leaders, being reduced to insignificance, along with digital music players (including Apple's own iPod) and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The original iPhone also spawned a new mobile device industry through its big brother, the iPad. Competing products, inspired by Apple touchscreen devices, soon appeared, notably Android phones and later Chromebooks. These products, in particular, have had a major impact on education, as they have made largely affordable the advanced features introduced by Apple. In this column we will be looking at what these devices have meant for language learning and literacy education. I will be arguing that the Apple-inspired touchscreen smartphone is not just another technological innovation, but rather a device that has ushered in a new era in the human-machine relationship and that, thereby, it has the potential (not yet realized) of fundamentally disrupting teaching and learning, including L1 and L2 literacies and learning.",

However, the feasibility and effectiveness of online corpus consultation for learners at a basic level of L2 proficiency have been relatively unexplored. The current study of Japanese-L1 (first language) learners in an EFL (English as a foreign language) context (N = 117) addresses these gaps in research. A preliminary investigation (Experiment 1) examined EFL learners (n = 78) as they used the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA: Davies, 2008) to revise essays. Experiment 2 (n = 39) used a within-subjects comparison to determine whether participants attained greater accuracy in supplying the missing word in a gap-fill test when using an electronic dictionary or COCA. The survey results from the two experiments revealed that participants generally found using an online corpus difficult. In Experiment 2, a paired-samples t-test showed that participants, at an alpha of p = 0.05 two-tailed, were marginally better able to answer test questions when using the online corpus than they were when using an electronic dictionary, p = 0.030. The implications of the study within the context of previous research are discussed along with pedagogical recommendations and possible avenues for future research.",

    "description": "In this study of affordances for second language (L2) learning in World of Warcraft (WoW) group play, we compared three gameplay episodes spanning a semester-long course. Applying multimodal analysis framed by ecological, dialogical and distributed (EDD) views (Zheng and Newgarden, forthcoming), we explored four English as a second language learners' verbalizations and avatar actions. Players learned to take skilled linguistic action as they coordinated recurrent WoW gameplay activities (questing, planning next moves, traveling, learning a skill, etc.). Frequent activities matched Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) speaking proficiency descriptors, used widely in L2 teaching and learning (L2TL), providing evidence that players engaged in the types of communicative activities interaction-oriented classroom approaches develop. However, in the WoW context, interactions were not planned, but emerged as players dynamically directed the course of play. Furthermore, modalities of avatar-embodiment and conversing over Skype allowed players to flexibly integrate language and actions to co-act toward game goals, discuss non-game topics during play, or demonstrate comprehension with avatar actions alone, an affordance for less verbal players. This research builds on previous work (Zheng, Newgarden &amp; Young, 2012) relating WoW's multiplayer activities and L2 learners' skilled linguistic actions. We refer to Chemero's (2009) model of the animal-environment system to explain how L2 learners develop abilities to take skilled linguistic action by acting on affordances in WoW. The EDD framework presented may enable other researchers to account for more of the complexities involved in L2 learning in multimodal, multiplayer virtual environments.",

    "description": "In spite of researchers' and practitioners' increasing attention to data-driven learning (DDL) and increasing numbers of DDL studies, a multi-item scale to measure learners' attitude toward DDL has not been developed thus far. In the present study, we developed and validated a psychometric scale to measure learners' perceived preferences and benefits of DDL for research and pedagogical purposes. First, we created an item pool by referring to open-ended responses from learners; second, the items were pilot tested with target-level learners of English as a foreign language; and third, with item analyses and exploratory factor analysis, the revised version of the questionnaire was prepared. Finally, the questionnaire was administered, and its psychometric properties were examined with confirmatory factor analysis and fit indices. The final phase also included a measure of task values to explore the convergent evidence of the construct validity of the proposed scale. The results suggest that the scale is a valid measure of learners' attitudes toward DDL, with the hypothesized model providing a good fit with the data. We propose that the scale can be used in future studies that utilize the same type of questionnaire research to facilitate further investigation of DDL. Suggestions for further research are also provided.",

This particular milieu unsurprisingly comprised &quot;third culture kids&quot; (TCKs) and &quot;cross-cultural kids&quot; (CCKs). They were assigned to a control and experimental group; both had several intensive weeks of online-dictionary learning training, while the experimental group also experienced intensive DDL training. This was done prior to the start of the eight-week longitudinal study. Major findings included a significant longitudinal main effect for both groups, significantly overall higher results for the experimental group than the control, and a significant difference among subjects' grade level was discovered. Furthermore, the experimental group exhibited a significantly marked increase in vocabulary results in the later weeks of the experiment. In general, these results show that DDL can be successful in the secondary school English as a foreign language (EFL) context and that it promotes significantly better vocabulary acquisition when used in conjunction with online-dictionary vocabulary learning methods, especially for a sustained longitudinal period of time.",

    "description": "Lexis-based views of second or foreign language (L2) teaching place prime importance on the teaching of conventionalized multi-word lexical items, or unanalyzed chunks, as a useful mechanism for fostering learners' creative production of forms and their subsequent development of L2 competence. This pretest/posttest quasiexperimental study probed the use of teacher-designed multi-purpose instructional lexis software, dubbed LexisBOARD, on L2 learners' vocabulary achievement in an Iranian EFL (English as a foreign language) context. A cohort of 50 Iranian junior-high-school students participated in the main instructional phase of the study. Instruction on L2 lexical items (e.g., concordances, polywords, or formulaic sequences) was mainly given to the experimental group using LexisBOARD, which was designed to be user-friendly and attuned to learners' communicative and curricular needs. LexisBOARD offered further practice or feedback affordances through engaging students in lexical exercises (with word partnerships and collocations) for each unit and several quizzes for self-assessment. The control group was only taught using their mainstream EFL textbooks focusing on grammatical rules, discrete vocabulary items with fixed meanings, and reading texts, without any use of corpus-based activities. The results of the groups' vocabulary test scores indicate that the lexis group significantly outperformed the control group, pointing to the superiority of practicing and learning L2 vocabulary when lexical items are seen in larger, more holistic ways and, especially, when engaging and experimenting with lexis is scaffolded through computer affordances.",

The results suggest that while multimodal resources integrate naturally to facilitate language teaching and learning in an orderly, structured and goal-orientated manner in classroom lessons, the often uncoordinated use (or absence) of avatars' gaze, facial expression, body posture, gesture, as well as the unclear proxemics and use of space pose problems for effective communication in a 3-D virtual world. In addition, a &quot;technology-oriented&quot; register, alongside traditional instructional and regulative genres and registers, is introduced to help students cope with the demands of learning a language in a 3-D virtual environment. The study raises the issue of the relative effectiveness of 3-D virtual worlds for language teaching and learning. In doing so, a digital approach to multimodal research is proposed in order to address the complexity of multimodal learning environments and the various challenges for CALL.",

    "author": "Abrams, Zsuzsanna Ittzes",
    "description": "Despite a growing body of research on task-based language learning (TBLT) (Samuda &amp; Bygate, 2008; Ellis, 2003), there is still little information available regarding the pedagogical design behind tasks and how they are implemented (Samuda &amp; Bygate, 2008). Scholars in computer-mediated second language (L2) learning have called for research to fill in this gap by reflecting critically on task design and the subsequent implementation process (Fuchs, Hauck &amp; M\u00fcller-Hartmann, 2012; Hampel, 2010; Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006; Hampel &amp; Plaines, 2013; Hauck, 2010), instead of considering a task an &quot;unproblematic fait accompli&quot; (O'Dowd &amp; Ware, 2009: 174). In response to this charge, the present case study provides a critical analysis of tasks carried out in a first-year German language course built around the weekly TV-series, &quot;Rosenheim-Cops&quot; (ZDF). These tasks drew from research on multimodality (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Norris &amp; Maier, 2014) providing a framework for understanding how multiple semiotic systems work together to create meaning. The insights provided by this study have relevance for research on multimodal task design (Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006) through examining the possibilities and limitations of beginner second language (L2) learners' effective use of authentic resources. The results suggest that the tasks encouraged semiotic awareness, helped activate referential knowledge useful for accessing multimodal resources, and elicited a positive response to authentic L2 use in context. The challenges of implementing these tasks included variation in learners' engagement with authentic multimedia resources, either due to L2 skills levels or the level of interest in the particular resource used.",

This paper aims to explore meaning-making in online language learner interactions via desktop videoconferencing (DVC) and in doing so illustrate multimodal transcription and analysis as well as the application of theoretical frameworks from other fields. Recordings of learner DVC interactions and interviews are qualitatively analysed within a case study methodology. The analysis focuses on how semiotic resources available in DVC are used for meaning-making, drawing on semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, nonverbal communication, multimodal interaction analysis and conversation analysis. The findings demonstrate the use of contextualization cues, five codes of the body, paralinguistic elements for emotional expression, gestures and overlapping speech in meaning-making. The paper concludes with recommendations for teachers and researchers using and investigating language learning and teaching in multimodal contexts.",

Following both a social semiotics approach and activity theory, this study focuses on six advanced Spanish learners' perceptions about the production of a digital story in which they integrated a variety of modes (written, oral, images, sounds) and manipulated the semiotic resources within each mode (size, color, lines in the image mode), to convey meaning. Analyzing participants' reflections, questionnaires, and online journals, results highlight learners' (a) interpretation of the tools and artifacts and their effect on their understanding of a final product, (b) connections between short-term goal-oriented actions and the longer-term object-oriented activity of developing a multimodal text, and (c) linguistic reorientations when creating a digital story.",

Specific examples are provided as illustrations [Facebook, Second Life and mobile assisted language learning (MALL)], though the approach is a general one. We describe the Next-TELL open learner model as an exemplar that can encompass a range of data from a variety of technologies and activities, and as a competence-focussed visual analytics tool that can be readily used inside and outside the classroom. The Next-TELL open learner model offers several visualisations for learners and teachers to explore the learner's current competences, which can be selected according to user preferences or the purpose of viewing the learning data. The selection of visualisations means that the open learner model is appropriate for school, university and other learning contexts. Viewing this data can help students to reflect on and monitor their learning, and can support teachers' decision-making during classroom activities or later, in their planning of subsequent sessions. As an example, we outline the use of the Next-TELL open learner model in a school in Norway.",

    "author": "Cho, Hyeyoung",
    "description": "Collaborative learning has attracted attention as pedagogic mediation to assist learners' corpus consultation, but some studies have pointed to negative aspects of collaboration. Based on the two sides of collaboration in language learning, this study presents a qualitative investigation of different effects of collaboration depending on task types used in learners' corpus consultation. This study examined two types of tasks: a conceptual task, which tested students' competence to draw a generalizable conclusion through a meaning-making process of corpus consultation; and a procedural task, which asked students to complete problem-solving activities strategically through corpus analysis. Two groups of three students were given the same tasks of corpus consultation but asked to complete the tasks either collaboratively or individually. The students' verbal and nonverbal behaviors during the task completion, pre-and post-interviews, and the instructor's observation notes were the main sources of data for analysis. The results of this study showed that collaboration has significantly different effects depending on the task types of corpus consultation. The collaborative group (CG) outperformed the individual group (IG) in the conceptual corpus consultation task, but the procedural task was more efficiently completed by the IG than the CG. The underperformance of the CG in the procedural task seemed to be partly attributable to the role of established intersubjectivity and the power inequality in the CG. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study reveal task-dependent effects of collaboration in corpus consultation and suggest practical implications for more effective and pedagogically beneficial use of learners' corpus consultation in second language (L2) instruction.",

    "description": "Research on data-driven learning (DDL), or teaching and learning languages with the help of electronic corpora, has shown that it is both effective and efficient. Nevertheless, DDL is still far from common pedagogical practice, not least because the empirical research on it is still limited and narrowly focused. This study addresses some gaps in that research by exploring the effectiveness of DDL for teaching low-proficiency learners lexico-grammatical constructions (verb-preposition collocations) in German, a morphologically rich language. The study employed a pretest-posttest design with intact third- and fourth-semester classes for German as a foreign language at a US university. The same collocations were taught to each group during one class period, with one group at each course level taking a paper-based DDL lesson with concordance lines from a native-speaker corpus and the other one taking a traditional rule-based lesson with textbook exercises. These constructions were new to third-semester students, whereas fourth-semester students had been exposed to them in the previous semester. The results show that, whereas the DDL method and the traditional method were both effective and resulted in lexical and grammatical gains, DDL was more effective for teaching new collocations. The study thus argues in favor of using paper-based DDL in the classroom at lower proficiency levels and for languages other than English.",

    "title": "A Semiotic Perspective on Webconferencing-Supported Language Teaching",
    "author": "Guichon, Nicolas, Wigham, Ciara R.",
    "description": "In webconferencing-supported teaching, the webcam mediates and organizes the pedagogical interaction. Previous research has provided a mixed picture of the use of the webcam: while it is seen as a useful medium to contribute to the personalization of the interlocutors' relationship, help regulate interaction and facilitate learner comprehension and involvement, the limited access to visual cues provided by the webcam is felt to be useless or even disruptive. This study examines the meaning-making potential of the webcam in pedagogical interactions from a semiotic perspective by exploring how trainee teachers use the affordances of the webcam to produce non-verbal cues that may be useful for mutual comprehension. The research context is a telecollaborative project where trainee teachers of French as a foreign language (FFL) met for online sessions in French with undergraduate Business students at an Irish university. Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, screen shot data, and students' post-course interviews, it was found, firstly, that while a head and shoulders framing shot was favoured by the trainee teachers, there does not appear to be an optimal framing choice for desktop videoconferencing among the three framing types identified. Secondly, there was a loss between the number of gestures performed by the trainee teachers and those that were visible for the students. Thirdly, when trainee teachers were able to coordinate the audio and kinesic modalities, communicative gestures that were framed, and held long enough to be perceived by the learners, were more likely to be valuable for mutual comprehension. The study highlights the need for trainee teachers to develop critical semiotic awareness to gain a better perception of the image they project of themselves in order to actualise the potential of the webcam and add more relief to their online teacher presence.",

    "description": "It has been suggested that current research in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) should seek to understand the conditions and circumstances that govern students' use of technology (Steel &amp; Levy, 2013). This paper attempts to identify critical factors accounting for student choices, first, by investigating advanced learners' reported use as well as their views on the potential of specific technological resources for language learning, and, second, by widening the perspective and surveying students' ideal learning environments. Learners' reasons for preferring teacher-fronted classes, blended learning, immersion or technology-mediated settings yield useful information on how students perceive the strengths and weaknesses of interaction/engagement with material (i.e. technological) as well as social (i.e. human) resources, and how the roles of teachers/classes can be conceptualised today. Data was collected via a survey of 175 Austrian university students which included Likert-type ratings and free text responses to open questions. Findings indicate that though the cohort routinely use a wide range of technology tools in their everyday lives and show awareness of the potential of ICT for language learning, a number of barriers exist based on learner beliefs/conceptions and learning aims. Thus the notion that enhancement of communicative competence is intrinsically tied to personal interaction with native speakers means that the potential of communication technologies such as Skype is not fully appreciated. It was further established that though many students are well versed in blending different technological resources in line with the criteria identified, thus displaying the hallmarks of autonomous learners, there was a clear preference for real-life compared to virtual environments.",

We evaluated this approach with Mandarin-speaking undergraduate students at the beginner level. Exploiting their knowledge of Mandarin, a closely related language, the students studied Cantonese with authentic material in a Cantonese-Mandarin parallel corpus, transcribed from television programs. They were given a list of Mandarin words that yield a range of possible Cantonese translations, depending on the linguistic context. Leveraging sentence and word alignments in the parallel corpus, the students independently searched for example sentences to discover these translation equivalents. Experimental results showed that, in both the short- and long-term, this data-driven learning approach helped students improve their knowledge of Cantonese vocabulary. These results suggest the potential of applying parallel corpora at even the beginners' level for other L1-L2 pairs of closely related languages.",

Not enough is known, however, about how auditory variation across speech tokens may affect receptive word learning. To find out, 144 Thai university students with no knowledge of the Patani Malay language learned 24 foreign words in a CALL program for receptive vocabulary learning. Word meanings were presented in line drawings, and their spoken forms presented by either one or three Patani Malay speakers. Several other variables were included for control. Logistic regressions with and without adjustment by other factors suggested learners recognized somewhat fewer word meanings when trained with three Patani Malay speakers, especially under varied image conditions. This finding implies fragile initial auditory representations, and limited processing resources. The application of current results and their interpretation to CALL may be to limit sources of variation that would otherwise direct attention away from word forms.",

    "description": "In recent years, students have shown growing interest in mobile learning and the use of mobile devices for learning English as a foreign language (EFL). However, it appears that further research needs to be undertaken to identify students' use of mobile devices and their attitudes towards them, especially in developing countries. To achieve this aim, three instruments, i.e. questionnaires (n = 345), in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 128), and non-participant observations (50 sessions), were employed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The results indicate that Iranian EFL students are generally positive about mobile learning and the use of mobile devices for learning EFL. The perceived benefits of mobile learning comprised opportunities for ubiquitous learning and access to the Internet, use of multimedia in the classroom, and portability. On the contrary, the findings suggest that students might be discouraged from the use of mobile devices due to several perceived impeding factors. The analysis of the data illustrated that Iranian EFL students mainly use mobile devices for non-academic purposes. The majority of students own smartphones and laptops and prefer to use tablet PCs, smartphones, and laptops for language learning. The findings of the observations suggest that even though some Iranian EFL teachers favor the use of mobile devices in the classroom, some of them prevent students from such use. In light of students' proposed strategies to implement mobile learning, the study suggests guidelines to integrate mobile learning in the EFL context of Iran and other similar contexts.",

However, little is known about the relationship between foreign language teachers' use of web conferencing technology and their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). This study therefore aims to assist Mandarin as a foreign language (MFL) teachers to develop their TPACK of web conferencing teaching, and a teacher support group is used to facilitate the TPACK development of four MFL teachers. The data related to assessing their TPACK development are derived from an online meeting, reflective reports, and individual interviews. The results indicate that the teachers' TPACK grew due to increased awareness of the affordances and constraints of web conferencing technology in an MFL teaching environment. They understood how to enhance learners' input, expand their interaction, and facilitate their production via the use of Internet resources such as multimedia and web-based applications. The teachers also acknowledged that the teacher support group had played an instrumental role in developing their TPACK of teaching MFL via web conferencing technology. The implications and limitations of the study are also presented.",

    "description": "This paper reports the development and validation process of a self-assessment survey that examines technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) among preservice teachers learning to teach English as a foreign language (EFL). The survey, called TPACK-EFL, aims to provide an assessment tool for preservice foreign language teachers that addresses subject-specific pedagogies and technologies. Using mixed methods approach, survey items were generated first using qualitative methods (e.g. expert interviews and document analysis). The content validity of the items was established through expert and preservice teacher reviews. The survey was then validated through two rounds of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the first with 174 preservice EFL teachers and the second with 204 preservice EFL teachers. The results of the first round indicated a five-factor structure: technological knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and a fifth factor that combined TCK, TPK, and TPACK items. After revising the survey, the second round of EFA results showed a seven-factor structure that was consistent with the TPACK framework. The final TPACK-EFL survey included a total of 39 items: 9 TK, 5 CK, 6 PK, 5 PCK, 3 TCK, 7 TPK, and 4 TPACK. The results offer survey developers and teacher educators insight into establishing clear boundaries between the TPACK constructs. In particular, subject-specific strategies were used to generate clear and distinct items within the TCK and TPK constructs. Implications for developing other subject-specific TPACK surveys and using the TPACK-EFL survey in other countries are discussed.",

Participants were asked to actively undertake the interactions with ASR-based computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) on a daily basis for three months. They were directed to finish a questionnaire on their perceptual learning style and technology acceptance. The collected data were analysed with descriptive statistics and structural equation model to investigate the structural relationships. Results show that most participants were visual learners; furthermore, no significant relationship between any type of perceptual learning style and perceived usefulness was discovered. Visual style as well as kinaesthetic style was found to be significantly influential to perceived ease of use which further significantly led to perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness was significantly related to attitude of using the system that was decisive to EFL learners' continuing use of ASR-based CAPT.",

    "title": "Developing and Evaluating a Chinese Collocation Retrieval Tool for CFL Students and Teachers",
    "author": "Chen, Howard Hao-Jan, Wu, Jian-Cheng, Yang, Christine Ting-Yu, Pan, Iting",
    "description": "The development of collocational knowledge is important for foreign language learners; unfortunately, learners often have difficulties producing proper collocations in the target language. Among the various ways of collocation learning, the DDL (data-driven learning) approach encourages the independent learning of collocations and allows learners to directly use corpora and tools to search for proper collocations. There are several useful collocation tools (JustTheWord, COCA, Tango, Gutenberg Collocation Tool) available for English as a second language (ESL) learners. There are, however, very few Chinese collocation tools available for learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL), despite the increasing numbers of CFL learners within the past several years. To help CFL students and teachers efficiently search for proper collocates, this paper introduces a new web-based collocation retrieval tool, ICE (Intelligent Collocation Engine), which is based on a large part-of-speech-tagged Chinese news corpus. To determine if the new tool can facilitate the searching of collocations, this tool was tested by a group of CFL students to find proper collocates in a translation task. The results showed that the students who used the ICE tool could successfully found many proper Chinese collocates for a given noun. In addition, 12 in-service CFL teachers were also invited to evaluate the effectiveness of this collocation tool. These teachers indicated that they could find proper Chinese collocates easily with the help of ICE. The teachers also commented that they might use the collocation retrieval tool to prepare their teaching materials. Both findings of the experiment as well as the survey suggest that the new collocation retrieval tool can facilitate Chinese collocation teaching and learning, but the content and functions of this tool can be further enhanced. The findings of this study can be useful for language teachers, researchers, and developers of corpus-based learning tools.",

    "description": "The act of note-taking offloads cognitive pressure and note-taking applications could be used as an important tool for foreign language acquisition. Its use, importance, and efficacy in a foreign language learning context could be justifiably debated. However, existing computer-assisted language learning literature is almost silent on the topic. This article reports on a controlled experiment introducing usability of note-taking applications (namely, Evernote, Memonic, SpringPad, Ubernote, and Keeppy) in English as foreign language (EFL) learning context. For pilot testing, 25 students had to complete five scenarios (text editing, entering persuasive content, sharing content, searching, and organizing) using Twitter as a tool similar to note-taking applications. Results suggest that the majority were comfortable with the tasks, although they could not complete all the tasks in the stipulated time, and certain tasks and features in Twitter caused difficulty for some students. The actual testing involved the 10 best candidates (based on their performance, when using Twitter) completing tasks (five scenarios similar to pilot analysis) with any two assigned note-taking applications, from a set of five. Participants were observed, video-recorded, and interviewed concurrently and retrospectively. They also completed perception-based questionnaires on the usability of the software. Data suggested that participants were comfortable opening accounts, typing in text, with general navigation, choosing photos, etc. A few features, such as web clipping and file uploading, caused problems for some participants. Most participants reported having no prior experience with any note-taking applications and that resulted in longer task completion time and errors. This study examines how technically oriented students reflect on using note-taking applications in an EFL learning context.",

    "description": "Oral production is an important part in English learning. Lack of a language environment with efficient instruction and feedback is a big issue for non-native speakers' English spoken skill improvement. A computer-assisted language learning system can provide many potential benefits to language learners. It allows adequate instructions and instant feedback to the student, thus it facilitates self-study and encourages interactive use of the language. In this paper, we analyse Chinese college students' speaking requirements first, and then based on these requirements and usability criteria, a detailed description of an oral skills development system is provided. In this system, supported by Automatic Speech Recognition technology, special interactive activities and feedback forms were designed and a prototype was set up and tested to verify the effectiveness of this proposal.",

The participants were 30 college EFL (English as a foreign language) learners in Taiwan. As a supplement to the insufficient speaking practice in class, each week over a semester, the participants were required to speak on a topic, record their speaking, and post it onto a class blog outside of class. In addition, they were required to listen to and provide comments on at least one other student's voice blog post every week. Blog posts from the first two and last two weeks were analyzed and compared for complexity (mean number of clauses per AS-unit, mean length of AS-unit, mean length of clause, modified type-token ratio), accuracy (percentage of error-free AS-units, percentage of error-free clauses, percentage of accurate use of grammatical verb forms), and fluency (number of syllables per minute, number of meaningful syllables per minute). Results showed that the participants made an improvement in their speaking complexity (greater mean length of AS-unit and clause) although no such improvement was made in their speaking accuracy and fluency.",

    "description": "Game-based learning activities that facilitate students' listening and speaking skills were designed in this study. To participate in learning activities, students in the control group used traditional methods, while students in the experimental group used a mobile system. In our study, we looked into the feasibility of mobile game-based learning activities. One experiment was carried out and the results revealed that the experimental-group students significantly outperformed the control-group students on the verbal post-test. However, the performance of the two groups was equal on the listening post-test. Two variables (the average score for the interactive jigsaw game and the number of designed cards) were found to be the most important factors for influencing students' performance in the verbal post-test. Furthermore, most students had positive perceptions toward learning activities that are supported by a mobile system. These results suggest that game-based learning activities can significantly improve students' speaking skills if driven by a mobile system. Furthermore, these results suggest that learning activities with a mobile system foster students to (1) practice speaking English as a foreign language (EFL) more frequently as well as to reflect on their speech; (2) create meaningful sentences and speak with greater accuracy and confidence; and (3) practice speaking EFL in an authentic context.",

The research-based intercultural exchange project of UBOD 12-15 was designed to develop learners' critical cultural awareness and to facilitate authentic interactions by engaging students in making deep cross-cultural inquiries. The UBOD 12-15 project, created by the Global Teenager Project, connected participants from five different countries with the help of a Wiki platform and a Moodle, which was used as an intra-class interaction tool. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to collect and analyze the data. The findings suggested that the research-based UBOD had a significant impact on the development of the learners' critical cultural awareness and foreign language use; in particular, this project encouraged intrinsically motivated cross-cultural learning and, further, led the learners to discard their cultural stereotypes and view others from a different perspective.",

In addition, the current research attempted to identify the distribution pattern of errors made by English as a foreign language (EFL) learners across error types combining grammar and cognitive strategies. Finally, the research surveyed subjects' attitudes toward the ICALL tutoring program and assessed its ability to help them acquire grammatical concepts. Overall, the statistical analysis reveals that a form-focused ICALL tutoring system that provides process-oriented feedback may serve to facilitate EFL learners' acquisition of grammatical concepts, and that the majority of subjects think favorably of the ICALL tutoring program.",

    "author": "Amiryousefi, Mohammad",
    "description": "Previous task repetition studies have primarily focused on how task repetition characteristics affect the complexity, accuracy, and fluency in L2 oral production with little attention to L2 written production. The main purpose of the study reported in this paper was to examine the effects of task repetition versus procedural repetition on the complexity, accuracy, and fluency (henceforth CAF) in low--intermediate English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' task-based, computer-mediated L2 written production. A secondary purpose was to examine the relationship between computer anxiety and EFL learners' development of CAF in L2 writing. The study employed a pretest-posttest design with 70 EFL learners from a language learning institution in Iran. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: task repetition or procedural repetition. The task repetition group repeated the same task procedure with the exact same content five times, whereas the procedural repetition group repeated the same task procedure with different content. The participants were also asked to complete the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale to measure their computer anxiety. The results revealed the following: (1) the beneficial effects of both tasks on the participants' L2 written production, (2) the differential effects of task repetition on the participants' writing CAF when compared with procedural repetition, and (3) no statistically significant relationship between computer anxiety and the participants' development of CAF in task-based, computer-mediated L2 written production. Implications are discussed, and avenues for future research are outlined.",

    "description": "This study examines EFL (English as a foreign Language) teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and how such knowledge affects the adoption of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL). A total of 158 in-service Taiwanese English teachers were surveyed. Two frameworks were employed to examine latent constructs: TPACK and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Descriptive statistics showed that among TPACK variables, technological pedagogical knowledge possessed the highest mean score. In terms of TAM, EFL teachers scored continuous usage (CU) highest, therefore implying that they were keen to use MALL in their lessons. The partial least square approach was applied to identify structural relationships between the proposed variables; it revealed that TPACK significantly affected both perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU). Furthermore, PEU significantly affected PU, which was shown to have a significant effect on both attitude toward use (ATU) and CU. The mediation effects of PU on the relationship between PEU and ATU, as well as CU, were also confirmed. Hence, TPACK was critical to MALL's adoption, and its PU was pivotal to teachers' attitudes toward and continued use of it.",

The evaluation revealed that domain experts and users (teachers and students) are generally positive about the system and intend to use it if they get the opportunity. In addition, recommendations have been made which range from specific changes and additions to the system to more general statements about the pedagogical and technological issues involved. These recommendations can be useful to improve this prototype and to develop other ASR-based systems, which can be deployed either as language courseware or as research tools to investigate design hypotheses and language acquisition processes.",

    "description": "The documentation of the benefits of blog use in foreign language education has proliferated since 2006. In the field of blogging to write, most studies focus on learners' linguistic performance and perceptions. To provide an analysis of learners' writing performance by using blogs, in addition to the often-researched areas, this study examines two further dimensions--learners' metalinguistic awareness and affective performance. This paper reports findings in these two areas. Twenty-six randomly selected, non-English majors participated in a conventional English writing class, forming the control group, while 18 students took part in a blog-integrated English experimental writing class. The results of comparison showed no significant differences between the two classes in regards to metalinguistic strategy use but there were significant differences in &quot;metalinguistic awareness.&quot; It is conjectured that more exposure to the target language materials, the interaction and collaboration among students, the aid of the reverse-chronological order of blogs, and the integration of blogs in the writing class significantly enhanced students' metalinguistic awareness. In affective performance, there were no significant differences between the two classes in writing motivation and writing anxiety. Nevertheless, it was the control class that significantly surpassed the experimental class in writing self-efficacy.",

    "description": "This paper reports an experiment designed to evaluate an attempt to improve the effectiveness of an existing L2 idiom-learning tool. In this tool, learners are helped to associate the abstract, idiomatic meaning of expressions such as &quot;jump the gun&quot; (act too soon) with their original, concrete meaning (e.g. associating &quot;jump the gun&quot; with the scene of a track athlete who starts running before the starting pistol is fired). This association lends concreteness to target lexis, which is known to facilitate learning (Paivio, A., &amp; Desrochers, A. (1979). Effects of an imagery mnemonic on second language recall and comprehension. &quot;Canadian Journal of Psychology,&quot; 33, 17-28). It is a mental operation that orients the learner first and foremost to the semantic dimension of the expression, however. It does not as such engage the learner with formal properties of the expression, such as its orthography. In an effort to stimulate the latter engagement, a copy exercise was incorporated in the learning procedure. The merit of this additional exercise was evaluated by having one group of students (N = 21) study 25 idioms according to the new procedure, while a comparison group (N = 21) was given an additional meaning-oriented task instead. Recall by the two groups was compared immediately and two weeks after the treatment by means of a gap-fill test. The copy exercise was not found to promote better recall, a result we discuss with reference to levels of processing theory (Lockhart, R.S., &amp; Craik, F.I.G. (1990). Levels of processing: A retrospective commentary on a framework for memory research. &quot;Canadian Journal of Psychology,&quot; 44, 87-112).",

    "description": "This study applied storytelling in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom in order to promote speaking skills. Students were asked to practice speaking EFL through producing individual and interactive stories with a Web-based multimedia system. We aimed to investigate an effectiveness of applying individual and interactive storytelling on speaking skills and the potential effects of multimedia aids in storytelling to facilitate language learning. Furthermore, we explored the relationships between research variables of this study, such as speaking performance on individual and interactive storytelling, the number of animation representations, and the system actual usage, with learning achievement. Four main findings were found in this study. First, students who used the system for creating stories significantly outperformed students who did not use it on the post-test. This finding suggests that storytelling activity with support of the system was beneficial for improving speaking skills. Second, speaking performance and the number of animation representations significantly correlated with learning achievement. Students who performed well during learning activities usually studied diligently and scored higher on final test. Animations could help students remember vocabulary and practice speaking to describe their animated stories. Third, only the speaking performance on individual storytelling was found as the significant predictor of learning achievement. Students working individually on storytelling were independent; they were less distracted from others, and had more opportunity for practice. The last but not the least, most students expressed positive perceptions and attitude toward the system and learning activities. Based on these findings, we suggest that storytelling learning activities supported by the Web-based multimedia system and implementing them in EFL learning classroom can be beneficial for facilitating speaking skills. Students can remember new vocabulary better, practice speaking skills more frequently, become competent in speaking target language, and improve learning performance.",

    "description": "Recognizing that graduate students seldom have the opportunity to participate collaboratively, either in providing or receiving feedback to improve their academic writing skills, this study reports on the design of a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) system used to investigate how graduate students transform and construct their academic knowledge through peer feedback when involved in summary writing. A sample of 24 graduate students who studied English as a foreign language was grouped into experimental and control groups, 13 and 11 graduate students in each group. The results of this study reveal that integrating the three key elements of a CSCL system facilitated improvement in the experimental group's summary writing. These key elements included (1) acquiring a basic understanding of main ideas by requesting keywords as scaffolds, (2) explicitly observing more proficient peers' writing processes when providing and receiving peer feedback (knowledge transformation), and (3) solving writing problems by revising their own summaries following peer feedback (knowledge construction). Based on the three key elements, the graduate students in the experimental group made more local (i.e., grammatical) and global revisions (i.e., text development, organization, and style) on their own as well as their peers' summaries, compared with the graduate students in the control group. The effectiveness of online peer feedback on summary writing, in transforming and constructing academic knowledge, is further discussed in this study.",

    "author": "Chen, I-Jung",
    "description": "This study compared how three different gloss modes affected college students' L2 reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. The study also compared how results on comprehension and vocabulary acquisition may differ depending on the four assessment methods used. A between-subjects design was employed with three groups of Mandarin-speaking college freshmen. The participants read an English passage, each with different gloss formats: in-text mode, marginal gloss mode, and pop-up mode. The English proficiency level of the participants was elementary. Summary writing and multiple-choice questions were used to assess reading comprehension; word translation and word matching were used to assess vocabulary acquisition. Results of a multivariate analysis of covariance (with proficiency as the covariate) indicated that different assessment methods using the same gloss mode yielded different outcomes. In general, while the marginal gloss mode resulted in the highest scores on the multiple choice test, in-text glosses brought about the best performance in the rest of the tests, and pop-up glosses led to the lowest scores on all four tests. This study suggests that student performance outcomes concerning gloss mode may be assessment specific. Researchers should consider how investigators obtain their outcomes when interpreting the results of a study.",

    "description": "Researchers have been keen to develop instruments for the assessment of teachers' self-perceived technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK); however, few studies have been conducted to validate such assessment tools through students' perspectives in the context of English as a foreign language (EFL). The purpose of this study was thus to develop a TPACK instrument that can be utilized to investigate EFL students' perceptions of their teachers' TPACK. Thirty-five survey questions were initially created through a literature review and then reviewed by experts, teachers, and students. Exploratory factor analysis was undertaken to ensure the validity of this scale and Cronbach's alpha was adopted to evaluate the internal consistency of the survey. The results revealed that the TPACK instrument was a valid and reliable tool for measuring EFL students' perceptions of their teachers' TPACK. Finally, suggestions are offered for future studies regarding the use of the TPACK instrument in the assessment of teachers' TPACK.",

    "description": "Helping students to become autonomous learners, who actively utilize technologies for learning outside the classroom, is important for successful language learning. Teachers, as significant social agents who shape students' intellectual and social experiences, have a critical role to play. This study examined students' and teachers' perceptions of the specific roles teachers may play in promoting autonomous language learning with technology outside the classroom. Interviews were conducted with 15 language learners and 10 language teachers at a university in Hong Kong. The study found mismatches between students' and teachers' perceptions of the degree of teacher involvement and the specific roles teachers could play. On the one hand, students expected teachers to play a greater role in supporting their autonomous learning with technology by recommending a variety of technological resources and sharing metacognitive and cognitive strategies for effective use of the resources. On the other hand, teachers expected to play a minimal role due to their overestimation of students' capacities and their concern over their limited abilities to provide such support. The research findings indicate the importance of raising teachers' awareness of the various roles their students expect them to play and of equipping teachers with the knowledge and skills to advise and support students in making use of technological resources outside the classroom for language learning.",

The learner corpus used in the present study is composed of 105 essays that were produced by first-year university students in Korea. The control corpus was taken from the American LOCNESS sub-corpus. The distribution of the different semantic categories was nearly identical in the Korean writing and the American writing. The additive relation was most frequently used, followed by the causal, adversative, and sequential relations. However, the Korean learners' overall overuse of linking adverbials pervaded all the semantic categories. Their overuse was particularly noticeable in the sequential and additive categories. Accordingly, the analysis showed that overuse hypothesis is clearly supported in the present study. On the basis of the results of the study, pedagogical implications and suggestions for further research are presented.",

    "author": "Mohsen, Mohammed Ali",
    "description": "Several types of help options have been incorporated into reading and listening comprehension activities to aid second language (L2) vocabulary acquisition. Textbook authors, teachers, and sometimes even students may pick and choose which help options they wish to use. In this paper, I investigate the effects of two help options in a multimedia listening environment (annotated captioned animation versus annotated transcript animation) on L2 vocabulary acquisition. Thirty-four Arab learners of English as a foreign language watched and listened to an animated story under any one of the following conditions: (1) annotations + captions + animation (ACA) and (2) annotations + transcripts+ animation (ATA). After viewing the story, the participants received a vocabulary posttest (i.e., L2 spelling) and posttest of translating Arabic words into the target language (L2 form recall). These tests were readministered five weeks after the treatment. The results revealed that the ACA and ATA groups performed significantly better on both L2 vocabulary spelling and L2 vocabulary recall in posttest and delayed test treatments than on L2 vocabulary spelling and recall in the pretest treatments. No significant difference was observed between the ACA and ATA groups in terms of vocabulary posttests. However, the ACA group slightly outscored the ATA group in the long-term L2 form recall tests (i.e., delayed tests). The results suggest that both types (i.e., ACA and ATA) help improve L2 vocabulary acquisition, whereas ACA surpasses ATA in aiding L2 vocabulary acquisition over a long term. In light of these findings, pedagogical implications to teachers, learners, and curricula designers are discussed.",

    "description": "Despite abundant research on educational technology and strategic input in the field, various surveys have shown that (language) teachers do not seem to embrace in their teaching the full potential of information and communication technology available in our everyday life. Language students soon entering the professional field could accelerate the process, which highlights the role of teacher education in contributing to the change. The students should see how technology development may change the affordances for language learning, at the same time transforming the teachers' professional roles and practices. However, taking an active role in designing a new kind of language pedagogy seems to be challenging for students. This study explores an attempt to facilitate the students' perspective switch from the teacher role to the designer position through participatory design. This effort was to lead the students to envision new practices for language learning and teaching with new technologies. However, initial analyses of the research materials indicated that, despite the support, the students were not fully able to see their role as designers for the future. Cultural-historical activity theory was used to examine the problem more closely. The analysis suggests that in order to position themselves as designers of the future language learning activity, language students need to understand their role as designers, conduct real-life experiments on the evolving visions with their learners, and involve learners as participants in the design activity by sharing visions and collaborative reflection on the experiments. The findings of the study provide tools for language teacher educators to make these activity systems visible and, thus, target for change.",

    "description": "This study investigates the different learning opportunities enabled by text-based and video-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) from an interactionist perspective. Six Chinese-speaking learners of English and six English-speaking learners of Chinese were paired up as tandem (reciprocal) learning dyads. Each dyad participated in four kinds of interactions, namely, English text-based SCMC, Chinese text-based SCMC, English video-based SCMC and Chinese video-based SCMC. Their use of communication strategies (CSs) were analyzed along with an after-task questionnaire and with stimulated reflection to explore systematically and comprehensively the differences between text-based and video-based SCMC. In addition to the main role of qualitative analysis, the quantitative analysis was undertaken to provide an overview of the relative frequencies of the occurrence of the different strategies and to understand their distribution in the different conditions. A MANOVA was applied to understand to what extent the differences are likely to have occurred by chance. The results showed that learners used CSs differently in text-based and video-based SCMC and indicated different learning opportunities provided by these two modes of SCMC. While text-based SCMC appears to have greater potential for learning target-like language forms, video-based SCMC seems particularly effective for fluency development as well as pronunciation improvement.",

    "description": "A strong relationship between L2 vocabulary knowledge and L2 reading and listening comprehension is well established. However, less research has been conducted to explore correlations between pedagogic interventions to increase vocabulary knowledge and score gains on standardized L2 proficiency tests. This study addresses this gap in the research by analyzing the relationship between extended study of a Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) word list using spaced repetition software (SRS) and TOEIC score gains. Two classes of Japanese students totaling 60 participants were encouraged to study a TOEIC word list using SRS for 10 months. TOEIC score gains from a pre-test to a post-test were then correlated with the number of flashcard repetitions to investigate the relationship between SRS study and test score gains. Statistically significant relationships (p &lt; 0.05) were found between total SRS repetitions and TOEIC listening and overall score gains. Total word list reviews accounted for 11.4% of the variance in overall TOEIC gains, 6.2% of the variance in reading gain and 7.2% of the variance in listening gains. The authors argue that study of test-specific word lists with SRS may be a useful addition to motivated students' test preparation strategies for standardized foreign language proficiency tests.",

The study offers analysis of how students used the CMC language school in a relatively uncontrolled setting using qualitative data collected from a student survey and quantitative data collected over a 12-week trial period. Motivational aspects of using technology and online chat to study English are generally considered to be high but speaking face-to-face online is not for everyone. The speaking project, although new and exciting initially, did not hold most students' attention throughout the project possibly due to few specific tasks and goals. For motivation to be\u00a0maintained by students, oral CMC projects should be based on an effective pedagogy that includes concrete tasks and specific goals. This finding validates other research where CMC was used in the classroom. The paper concludes with a discussion of reasons for the lack of student enthusiasm toward the project centering on task-based learning, use of social media for schoolwork in addition to motivational and autonomous learning factors.",

    "description": "Content-based instruction (CBI) has been widely adopted for decades. However, existing CBI models cannot always be effectively put into practice, especially for learners of lower English proficiency in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. This study examined an animation design course adopting CBI to promote reading abilities of English majors at a technology university in Taiwan. CBI usually adds challenges in cognitive and linguistic learning, especially for English majors in computer courses. Different from other CBI courses, this course dealt with multiple situations: multi-approaches (CBI and task-based instruction); multi-skills (Flash animation software skills--various animation effects; language skills--computer vocabulary and reading comprehension); multi-level learners (various English language proficiency levels--mostly low proficiency level; computer abilities; learning styles), and a large class taught by one instructor. Simply employing CBI cannot solve such complex problems. Therefore, instructional streaming video was applied as a learner-directed scaffold and a technological facilitator. A control group and an experimental group comprised 117 and 121 English majors taking this course for one semester respectively. Both groups were taught with English materials but the later were additionally provided with instructional streaming video (ISV). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from classroom observations, interviews, exams, and semester-end questionnaires from both groups to examine whether ISV facilitated instructor teaching and student learning. Results show that the experimental group significantly performed better in reading comprehension, reading speed, acceptance, attention, and exams, as well as easing teaching difficulties. Drawn upon empirical results, a technology-assisted sheltered model was generated for EFL multi-purpose courses.",

    "description": "This study presents first-year findings of a 25-week longitudinal project derived from a two-year longitudinal randomized trial study at the elementary school level in Costa Rica on effective computer-assisted language learning (CALL) approaches in an English as a foreign language (EFL) setting. A pre-test-post-test experimental group design was implemented to evaluate two varying types of CALL curriculum (Treatment A and Treatment B, both technology based to assist English language learning) with a difference in students' time-on-task, as opposed to the Control/Comparison group (that received no treatment and was a typical practice within the regular English teaching time period). Four subtests from Woodcock Munoz Language Survey-Revised (WMLS-R), a norm-referenced, standardized instrument, were selected to monitor participants' oral English development. A total of 76 urban, rural, and urban/marginal schools with 816 third graders were included in the analysis through multilevel modeling. Results suggested that (1) students held very limited oral English proficiency at the beginning of the third grade; (2) although students significantly improved their oral English proficiency during the 25-week intervention, they were still significantly below the typical native English-speaking norm at the end of the third-grade level; (3) those who were exposed to CALL modules in Treatment A developed at a faster rate than did students in Treatment B and in Control classrooms in lexical knowledge and listening skills when statistically controlling for student-level variables, including initial level and time-on-task; (4) although students in CALL intervention (especially in Treatment B) started with a lower level of oral English proficiency, their gain was numerically higher than that in the Control condition; and (5) time-on-task demonstrated to be an irrelevant variable in the study. These findings imply that it is not just exposure to English that matters for significant gains in the language; rather, it is the type of instruction a student receives, or the quality of instruction in which the software engages the students interactively in a hands-on, minds-on, scaffolded manner, that matters the most in developing steep gains. Finally, we recommend that additional research be conducted with groups that move through kindergarten, first grade, and second grade longitudinally to determine cohort effects in learning English via CALL instruction in EFL countries.",

Others present a negative view that the comments generated from technology-supported interaction tend to be superficial and that technical problems reduce participant motivation in peer interaction. These contradictory results call for a systematic literature review of this topic. An exhaustive literature search in a variety of academic sources identified 95 studies from 1990 to 2010 dealing with peer feedback in English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) writing classrooms. Of these, 54 contained qualitative data, 20 of which were specifically on computer-mediated peer feedback. Concentrating on these 20 articles, the researcher conducted comparative reviews of the characteristics, the pros and cons, and the differences between synchronous and asynchronous interaction for this mode of peer feedback, using Glaser and Strauss' Grounded Theory (1967) constant comparison method. Based on the findings, several main themes are identified and three implications involving pedagogy, group dynamics, and training for future research on this mode of peer feedback are discussed.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools to facilitate second language acquisition and develop English as a second language (ESL) teaching skills and cultural awareness. The paper describes a collaborative online project between students from China and the USA, who communicated using the discussion board and e-mail tools on blackboard for tutoring and learning different aspects of English grammar and for developing culture awareness. Twenty-three American students from an ESL teaching program were paired up with 26 Chinese first-year English majors and tutored them on grammar structures that they selected after analyzing the Chinese students' introductory essays on American life and culture for grammar mistakes. The tutorials addressed specific grammar points and were presented through texts that described different aspects of American culture. The Chinese students used the discussion board and e-mail as well as Skype to communicate with their American partners and at the end of the project wrote a second essay on the same topic which was analyzed for grammar errors by the American students. The results from analyzing the students' postings, essays, and interviews suggest that the two groups benefited in three areas: (1) improving teaching skills through tutoring non-native speakers of English; (2) developing cross-cultural awareness; and (3) improving non-native speakers' language skills. This study demonstrates that CMC can be used to help students from two different countries and two different programs to improve their skills in their field of study and at the same time to develop cross-cultural awareness.",

The results showed that online cooperative translations could significantly increase student interest and self-efficacy in specialized English translation. In cooperative translation, student engagement was significantly and linearly correlated with their interest and self-efficacy in translation.

    "description": "This exploratory study contributes to the underexplored area of collaborative task formats in telecollaboration. The study investigates how English as a second language (ESL) student teachers in the US and English as a foreign language (EFL) student teachers in Turkey negotiated the design, implementation, and evaluation of technology-based English language learning tasks. The overall pedagogical goal of this spring 2014 project was to provide participants in different educational and institutional settings an opportunity to collaboratively explore and evaluate the affordances of technology tools in the design of joint learning tasks. This ethnographic case study triangulates questionnaires, telecollaboration logs, and computer-mediated communication data (blogs, emails) to examine the types of negotiation (personal, interactive, procedural) telecollaborative teams displayed at the project's micro levels (self, situated telecollaborative activity) and macro levels (institutional setting, political context). Findings indicate that one telecollaborative team, Global Team 2, effectively managed their learning as a group by making key decisions collectively about their work processes. The team's high number of procedural negotiation instances suggests a high degree of task-orientation, which may have aided their task completion. In contrast, the number of personal and interactive negotiation types was low. The latter, however, may have been called for midway through the project, when unexpected political developments in Turkey unfolded. Repercussions disturbed Turkish participants and affected social media, which were at the core of this telecollaboration. Implications focus on foregrounding personal and interactive negotiation via virtual Global Team check-ins, as well as on expanding collaborative tasks by incorporating perspectives on the wider institutional and sociopolitical contexts of participating institutions.",

    "description": "This study examines the differential impact of tutor labeling vs. non-labeling approaches on the performance; motivation beliefs; and cognitive, social, and teaching presence of low-achieving students. Two interactive tutoring strategy patterns are investigated based on the taxonomical e-moderating model of Salmon. In addition, the tutees' online learning behaviors and experiences and perceptions of e-tutoring interventions are explored. This study found that the variations in the tutors' labeling intervention were not directly reflected either in the tutors' tutoring strategies or moderating stages or in the tutees' English performance, motivation beliefs (measured on eight subscales), or three types of presence. However, the labeling intervention increased the tutees' motivation belief of self-efficacy. Implications for further research and the limitations of this investigation are discussed.",

    "description": "There is much evidence to support the occurrence of learning in connection with collaboration, both in face-to-face and online teaching situations, but much less research on how such collaboration develops over the duration of a course. Using Dillenbourg's concepts of &quot;situation,&quot; &quot;interactions,&quot; &quot;mechanisms,&quot; and &quot;effects&quot; as a framework, this study aims to fill that gap by following a group of 47 university students participating in a 15-week online English course for low- to mid-intermediate learners. Data gathered included participants' reflective journals, questionnaires, written assignments, comments posted on Discussion Forums in a Learning Management System, and e-mail exchanges between individual students and the instructor. These were analysed using open, axial, and selective coding. Three different forms of collaboration were identified--reading each other's work, providing feedback, and working in groups. The main points to emerge from the study were the importance of the social aspect of collaboration, of allowing time for collaboration to develop, and the effect of the gradual development of confidence among the students. Patterns of collaboration changed as the group developed a sense of community and mutual trust, with students who initially held back from offering their work for comment gradually posting their work early to encourage feedback from others.",

    "description": "A few computer-assisted language learning (CALL) instruments have been developed in Iran to measure EFL (English as a foreign language) learners' attitude toward CALL. However, these instruments have no solid validity argument and accordingly would be unable to provide a reliable measurement of attitude. The present study aimed to develop a CALL attitude instrument (CALLAI) to be used in the Iranian EFL context. A pool of 633 survey items was developed and 27 items were judged to be appropriate for measuring CALL attitude. The chosen items were translated and back-translated by experts and were administered to 1001 Iranian EFL learners. The psychometric features of the items were examined using three primary data analysis techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the Rasch-Andrich rating scale model. Finally, a validity argument for CALLAI was developed which comprised five primary inferences. The findings from the psychometric analysis were mapped onto the validity framework. The validity framework is generally well-supported, although adding a few items could yield higher reliability coefficients.",

    "description": "This paper reflects upon the evolution of technology-enhanced language learning throughout the past two decades based on the author's own experience and how Information and Communications Technologies have played a prominent role on how language teaching pedagogies have evolved alongside the technologies themselves. Reference is made to the milestones that have marked the evolution of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and how future trends are developing. The author discusses her vision of CALL and develops the concept of &quot;atomised CALL&quot;, a theory first introduced in 2013. Atomised CALL describes the field of CALL from 2010 onwards, i.e. from Mark Warschauer's definition of &quot;integrative CALL&quot;. In relation to Bax's theory about the &quot;normalisation&quot; of CALL, the author defends that, as long as technology continues to evolve and new gadgets appear on the market, there will always be a place for CALL developers and authors to find the optimum way of pedagogically exploiting these forever-emerging technological developments.",

    "author": "Chou, I-Chia",
    "description": "As electronic books continue to attract attention as a pedagogical tool in language classrooms, the impact that e-books are expected to have on higher education cannot be ignored. Despite the pervasiveness of e-book reading studies in higher education, most studies show that students' reactions to e-books are often negative. However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms. The different results may be due to different reading purposes. In addition, limited studies have investigated whether students' perceptions of e-books change over time since many of the e-book reading studies used a survey, rather than longitudinal, approach. Thus, this study intended to determine (1) English as a foreign language (EFL) college students' perceptions of e-books when they read for the purpose of responding to literature rather than for the purpose of intensively studying in an academic context; and (2) whether these perceptions change over time as based on a qualitative perspective. Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books. However, the e-book reading experience was still considered unpleasant to most of the participants in this study. This implies that the reading purpose may not have a great influence on students' perception of e-books. Despite the overall negative perceptions of e-books, the students also demonstrated some improved attitudes toward reading e-books for an entire semester. The findings indicate that when students are given time and opportunities to read e-books, they are likely to develop e-book reading habits and strategies. It would be a pity if we gave up providing students e-books merely because of their initial negative attitudes.",

However, learning style preference and demographic variables may affect the effectiveness of technology use for a desired goal. Adapting Reid's pioneering Perceptual Learning Style Preference Questionnaire (PLSPQ), this study investigated the relations of university students' learning styles and the use of computer technology for language learning, and whether the demographic variables of gender and age would make a difference. Chinese students aged 17-36 years (M = 20.31, SD = 3.42) from two universities in Hong Kong (N = 401: male = 140 and female = 261) responded to a survey about four learning styles and computer technology. Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis established the five factors, which were all positively correlated. No gender differences were found in technology application and learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile). Only some subtle age differences were found in kinesthetic and tactile styles but not in technology use. Structural equation modeling found significant relations of computer use with visual and kinesthetic learning styles but not auditory and tactile styles. Evidence points to the benefit of helping the learners to discover their own learning styles, and optimizing learners' visual and kinesthetic learning for the use of computer resources and activities for language learning.",

    "author": "Galla, Candace Kaleimamoowahinekapu",
    "description": "Within the last two decades, there has been increased interest in how technology supports Indigenous language revitalization and reclamation efforts. This paper considers the effect technology has on Indigenous language learning and teaching, while conceptualizing how language educators, speakers, learners, and technology users holistically understand, skillfully apply and communicate creative and balanced technological solutions that are based on understanding of contextual factors. A total of 80 participants representing at least 47 Indigenous languages completed a survey in 2009 representing individuals, organizations, and institutions that serve one or more Indigenous language communities across the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Guatemala, Peru, Greenland, Mexico, Bolivia, French Polynesia (Marquesas Islands and Tuamotu Islands), and Russia. The data reveal the functions digital technology has in Indigenous language revitalization, which include (1) positive and supportive roles (2) concerns, constraints, and tensions, and (3) Indigenous language education. Regardless of the size of the community, opportunities for using technology in Indigenous language revitalization efforts are shaped by linguistic, cultural, social, economic, environmental, and technological factors as expressed in the technacy framework for language revitalization. Findings indicate that technology has wide and mostly positive applications in language learning and teaching, that the benefits of those applications remain consistent across communities regardless of size and geographic location, and that new and innovative uses of technology are being adopted to support language revitalization efforts. Overall, the study underscores the importance of context in making grounded decisions about technology as a component of contemporary language revitalization efforts.",

    "description": "This case study investigated the characteristics of computer-mediated synchronous corrective feedback (SCF, provided while students wrote) and asynchronous corrective feedback (ACF, provided after students had finished writing) in an EFL writing task. The task, designed to elicit the use of the hypothetical conditional, was completed by two Japanese university students in either the SCF or ACF condition. The writing process was video-recorded using the screen-capture function. An interview involving stimulated recall was conducted immediately after the writing session to investigate the two writers' perceptions about the feedback they received. The main findings were that (1) SCF created an interactive writing process similar in some respects to oral corrective feedback; (2) both the SCF and ACF promoted noticing-the-gap, but self-correction was more successful in the SCF condition; (3) focus on meaning and form took place contiguously in the SCF condition while it occurred separately in the ACF condition; and (4) both types of feedback facilitated metalinguistic understanding of the target feature, reflecting the unique features of writing (i.e., its slow pace, its permanency and the need of accuracy). These differences were confirmed by analyzing compositions written by 15 similar learners who received either type of feedback.",

The present study investigates peer comments made through blogs, the nature of the comments and their areas of focus, and the ratios of students incorporating suggestions made through blog-based comments into revisions of their writing. Thirty-two second-year English major students taking a 15-week academic writing course at Nong Lam University in Ho Chi Minh City were selected to participate in this study. The students posted their writings on blogs and, through blog comments, also provided and received suggestions for revision. The results indicated that though the comments on global areas were greater than those on local areas, the qualified comments (revision-oriented comments) were not guaranteed to be greater in the global area. The total revisions made during blog-based peer response were greater than the total revision-oriented comments delivered by peers. In addition, revisions at lower levels such as &quot;word&quot; or &quot;phrase&quot; needed less help from peers, whereas those at higher levels such as &quot;sentence&quot; or &quot;paragraph&quot; needed more help from peers.

    "author": "Lawley, Jim",
    "description": "Research has shown that any assumption that L2 learners of English do well to rely on the feedback provided by generic spell checkers (for example, the MS Word spell checker) is misplaced. Efforts to develop spell checkers specifically for L2 learners have focused on training software to offer more appropriate suggestion lists for replacing misspellings, but research suggests that students often select the wrong word from such lists. Moreover, since their spelling errors are often competence errors arising from misconceptions about the target language, students might benefit from feedback that addresses the underlying problem rather than simply suggesting the correct word. This article describes the use of a corpus of learner English to identify common misspellings produced by Spanish learners of English. For each of these errors, hand-crafted feedback has been written explaining how the correct spelling is consistent with the orthography or morphology of English. This material has been incorporated into a prototype spell checker for learners of English. Meanwhile, the software simply flags other errors as &quot;not amongst the 90,000 commonest words of English&quot;. Because it also detects unusual bigrams (word pairs), the program finds more spelling errors than generic spell checkers and additionally detects some non-spelling errors. Tests indicate that such easy-to-build spell checkers might become useful tools for L2 learners, and, along with other recent technological developments, suggest that student self-correction of compositions (including grammatical and lexical errors as well as spelling errors) is becoming increasingly feasible.",

    "author": "Ware, Paige, Kessler, Greg",
    "description": "This study builds on research examining the in-school technology practices of adolescent language learners by exploring the patterns of classroom literacy practices that emerge when a telecollaborative project is introduced into a conventional secondary language classroom. We draw on the conceptual frameworks and discourse analytical tools developed by researchers of online communication practices at the post-secondary level and turn this lens to examine how an international online exchange project might contribute to the creation of an in-school learning environment in which adolescents use technology to interact with distally located peers through telecollaboration. The particular contribution of this study is twofold: to offer insight into patterns that characterize the literacy practices that emerge through the introduction of telecollaboration into the learning environment and to document the types of pedagogical decision-making that such projects introduce into the secondary context. Using a case-study design, we explored two central areas: (1) What patterns of interaction emerge in the literacy practices of adolescent students as they build relationships with their intercultural partners? (2) How do teachers address the pedagogical issues that are foregrounded when introducing innovative literacy practices such as telecollaboration into the secondary learning environment? Our premise is that online exchanges might offer a different kind of learning experience that provides opportunities for adolescents to engage with language in ways that do not typically get enacted in conventional language classrooms. Our interest therefore is grounded both in providing a rich, descriptive inventory of how adolescents engage with telecollaboration in the classroom context, as well as in documenting the types of pedagogical issues that are introduced. We offer a linguistically grounded portrait of what constitutes the interactional patterns and pedagogical issues in a classroom learning environment shaped by the introduction of an online intercultural project. Using a case-study approach, therefore, we provide close documentation and analyses of a 15-week, classroom-based telecollaboration project through student transcripts and focal teacher interviews. We conclude with a discussion of the empirical and pedagogical implications associated with integrating telecollaboration into secondary language classroom contexts.",

With an AB-BA design, they were asked to use two forms of writing media to present two essays: one a word-processed essay entitled &quot;My Favourite Female&quot; and the other a conventional hand-written essay entitled &quot;My Favourite Male&quot;. The essays were marked by experienced Chinese language experts and the learners' impression of using each type of writing medium was gathered via questionnaires and interviews. Inferential statistics showed that the students performed significantly better when using a word-processor, and they thought that completing writing tasks using pencil-and-paper and word-processors were markedly different. Most of them felt that their work was more professional when produced on a word-processor. A small number of students considered that writing by hand in Chinese was aesthetically pleasing, but they appreciated the convenience of writing in words spelled and written correctly by the computer. Inter-marker consistency was more homogeneous for essays written on the computer. In conclusion, word-processors are suggested as the preferred writing medium for beginning learners of CFL.",

    "description": "The rapid development of the digital classroom has made it possible to combine extensive reading with online writing, yet research and development in this area are lacking. This study explores the impact of online writing after extensive reading in a classroom setting in China where there was one computer for each student (a 1:1 digital classroom). Thirty-nine fifth graders from an elementary school participated in the study. These students were divided into three groups with equivalent pretest score averages. Members of each group wrote Chinese compositions online after reading in one of the following three conditions in the same 1:1 digital classroom: (1) Objective-Focused Fast Extensive Reading (OFFER), an extensive reading strategy developed for and tested in this study; (2) one-size-fits-all extensive reading; (3) zero extensive reading, using only the class textbook. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using data from four sources: scores from three teacher judges, comments from those judges, comment icons from classmates, and writing speed data collected via the learning management system. The results indicated that the OFFER group showed significant superiority in writing quality and quantity compared to the other two groups. It is concluded that (1) extensive reading can be utilized not only for cultivating reading interest, but also for promoting writing, and (2) the OFFER strategy can lead to improved writing quality and fluency compared to one-size-fits-all extensive reading. Further suggestions for researchers and language teachers are proposed in the final part of the paper.",

However, research of Facebook has lagged behind other Web 2.0 technologies, particularly in regards to investigating its efficacy versus a control group to improve L2 writing. This study, which involved 30 Japanese university English as a foreign language (EFL) students, aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining three areas of L2 writing, namely--writing fluency, lexical richness, and grammatical accuracy--in an experimental group using Facebook (n = 16) and a control group (n = 14) using paper-and-pencil. Both groups underwent a 12-week treatment of two in-class focused freewritings a week. Three writing assessments were administered at the start, middle, and end of the treatment to assess its effectiveness. Results from the Mann-Whitney test showed that the experimental group made more significant gains in terms of writing fluency. On the other hand, neither group made significant progress in lexical richness nor grammatical accuracy. These findings strengthen previous research in support of the use of Facebook in L2 classes and highlight the need for additional studies comparing Facebook with other writing mediums.",

While studies in face-to-face contexts demonstrate the benefits of communication strategy instruction (CSI), there have been few attempts to integrate computer-mediated communication and CSI. The study reported in this article examined the relationship between computer-mediated CSI and CS use and types. It also investigated student perceptions of this form of instruction. Two groups of students enrolled in the same undergraduate course at a university in South Korea participated in the study. Over the course of one semester, the Strategy Group (n = 11) participated in CSI, whereas the Comparison Group (n = 14) did not. Throughout the semester, students in both groups completed nine chatting tasks, and transcripts from these sessions were analyzed to identify the frequency and types of CSs employed. In addition to questionnaire data showing that the Strategy Group perceived CSI favorably, the results show that the Strategy Group used significantly more CSs than the Comparison Group, and that the two groups differed in regards to specific strategies they employed. This study offers recommendations for future research investigating CS use and the instructional components of CSI.",

This computer assisted language learning research aimed to determine whether specific technology features of a tablet computer can add to the functionality of multisensory instruction in early reading acquisition. The effects of multisensory elements from the different modalities (letter card and iPad) on bilingual readers' natural abilities to blend and segment non-words were compared. The quasi-experimental post-test study involved 56 high- and low-ability Malay-English Grade 2 students. Multisensory-based materials to build and to break apart non-words in both letter card and iPad modalities were experimented. The results indicated no significant difference in the effect of the multisensory modalities on blending and segmenting tasks. As both conventional letter cards and touch-screen tablet computers produced similar outcomes, the practical implication is that both are equally adequate for providing the multisensory component in multisensory instruction. The writing systems (Malay and English), the type of tasks (blending and segmenting), and extreme groups (high- and low-performing) did not moderate the effects of the multisensory modalities.",

    "author": "Lee, Kean Wah, Said, Noraini, Tan, Choon Keong",
    "description": "The writing process has traditionally been seen &quot;as a lonely journey&quot; to typify the lack of support that students experience for writing outside the classroom. This paper examines an attempt of The Writing Portal (TWP), a supplementary online writing platform, to support students' writing needs throughout the five stages of the writing process, viz., planning, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing. Social constructivist principles underpin TWP, which was designed to engender collaboration amongst its student participants. Not only does TWP provide links to evaluated Internet resources and a writing portfolio, but it also features collaboration tools such as the Group Forum, chat, a writing portfolio, a private messaging system, and a comment function for pages or articles created. Thus, it is very much akin to a &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for academic writing within a flexible and supportive environment. In this qualitative case study, 16 third-year TESL pre-service teachers at a Malaysian Teacher Education Institute embarked on a 12-week writing course using TWP. Qualitative data in the form of students' online discourses, task reflections, log files, and digital artefacts were captured to explore how TWP's affordances supported students' writing needs. In addition, Soller's collaborative learning conversation skills (CLCS) taxonomy was used as an analytical framework to investigate the collaborative learning engendered in the online environment. The findings indicate that TWP served its purpose by addressing students' writing needs at all stages of the writing process as they accomplished multiple writing tasks. Additionally, evidence of collaborative learning is evident in three functions of TWP: the Group Forum, chat, and the comments for pages/articles. However, there are differences between the frequencies of the specific skills used for each function.

    "description": "This study investigates a computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) technique that combines oral reading with peer review to improve pronunciation of Taiwanese English major students. In addition to traditional in-class instruction, students were given a short passage every week along with a recording of the respective text, read by a native speaker. They practiced at home by listening to the recordings, reading out loud while listening, recording themselves, and comparing their recordings to the native speaker. When satisfied, they posted their own recording to an online discussion board. Every student listened to the recordings of three classmates, supplying feedback through the discussion board. Two control groups received only in-class instruction without the recording and posting assignments. Results show that the integration of the CAPT technique was superior in reducing students' pronunciation problems compared to only in-class instruction.",

    "author": "Kozar, Olga",
    "description": "Videoconferencing tools, like Skype, etc., are being increasingly used in language education worldwide. Despite assumed socio-affective and pedagogical benefits of using webcams in synchronous online language lessons, such as the feeling of co-presence or the possibilities of non-verbal communication, little is known about attitudes held by experienced online teachers towards webcams and their actual use of this tool during private online language lessons. This study interviews 20 experienced online language tutors and 20 adult students about their attitudes towards webcams and their use of webcams. The findings suggest that most teachers and students only used webcams at the start of their lessons for socio-affective reasons and discontinued the use of webcams after the first 2-3 weeks. Some common reasons for reducing the use of webcams were the perception of &quot;webcamming&quot; as a more tiring mode, the feeling of self-consciousness and privacy concerns. The study calls for more research on the use of webcams, webcam-specific semio-pedagogical skills and suggests directions of future studies.",

    "title": "Analysing Concordancing: A Simple or Multifaceted Construct?",
    "author": "Ballance, Oliver James",
    "description": "In pedagogical contexts, concordancing is often researched in relation to a non-concordanced-based learning condition, such as dictionary-based learning, and studies have generally shown concordancing to be a valuable language learning resource, as indicated by Tom Cobb and Alex Boutlon's recent meta-analysis. However, studies framed in terms of concordancing often overlook potentially significant differences in concordancing conditions by treating concordances as a simple, unidimensional construct. This study identifies variables within concordancing that may provide learners with diverging affordances, affordances that are not mutually compatible, and explores concordancing through a survey of concordance users' preferences. The data is analysed through a series of factor analyses which indicate that concordancing is a complex, multidimensional construct. It finds that there are at least four factors underlying the construct of concordancing: how citations are formatted, the type of corpus used, the order citations are presented in, and the task engaged in. Each of these factors represents a dimension of variance amongst concordance users. If it is safe to assume that concordance users' preferences are unlikely to be arbitrary, and are likely to indicate the affordances of concordancing in a particular configuration, then each factor represents a potentially significant variable in learner use of concordances. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the construct identified in relation to learner concordance use.",

    "description": "We developed a visual training tool to assist children with developmental dyslexia in learning to recognize and understand Chinese characters (kanji). The visual training tool presents the strokes of a kanji character as separate shapes and requires students to use these fragments to construct the character. Two types of experiments were conducted to investigate the differences between the effects of the visual training tool and a traditional Japanese teaching method--&quot;shi-sha-ho,&quot; which consists of copying a visually displayed model--on developmentally dyslexic children's kanji writing skills. Six Japanese children with developmental dyslexia (7-11\u00a0years old) and 58 controls (7-8 years old) participated in the first experiment. Participants used both the visual training tool and the &quot;shi-sha-ho.&quot; We found that the visual training tool was more effective than the &quot;shi-sha-ho&quot; for use with Japanese children with developmental dyslexia in learning kanji, both just after the experiment was completed and four weeks later. In the second experiment, we asked four participants with dyslexia to use the visual training tool at home for four weeks prior to the second experiment once a week for four weeks. Participants learned one kanji character each week during the two weekly sessions for a period of eight weeks using the visual training tool. The post-tests were conducted four and eight weeks after the experiment. Participants' retention of the target kanji was at least up to eight weeks. Results of the second experiment showed the visual training tool developed in the present study have shown the possibility of becoming a promising tool for children with developmental dyslexia.",

    "description": "Multiple-choice formats remain a popular design for assessing listening comprehension, yet no consensus has been reached on how multiple-choice formats should be employed. Some researchers argue that test takers must be provided with a preview of the items prior to the input (Buck, 1995; Sherman, 1997); others argue that a preview may decrease the authenticity of the task by changing the way input is processed (Hughes, 2003). Using stratified random sampling techniques, more and less proficient Japanese university English learners (N = 206) were assigned one of three test conditions: preview of question stem and answer options (n = 67), preview of question stem only (n = 70), and no preview (n = 69). A two-way ANOVA, with test condition and listening proficiency level as independent variables and score on the multiple-choice listening test as the dependent variable, indicated that the amount of item preview affected test scores but did not affect high and low proficiency students' scores differently. Item-level analysis identified items that were harder or easier than expected for one or more of the conditions, and the researchers posit three possible sources for these unexpected findings: 1) frequency of options in the input, 2) location of item focus, and 3) presence of organizational markers.",

    "description": "Research shows that computer-generated corrective feedback can promote second language development, but there is no consensus about which type is the most effective. The scale is tipped in favor of more explicit feedback that provides metalinguistic explanations, but counterevidence indicates that minimally explicit feedback of the &quot;right/wrong&quot; type may promote comparable learning outcomes. Addressing these conflicting findings, the present study investigated the effects of different types and amounts of practice as variables that may moderate the effectiveness of computerized &quot;right/wrong&quot; feedback. Fifty-two learners of intermediate Spanish completed either 28 or 56 items of an input-based task with 2 or 4 options targeting Spanish past counterfactual conditional sentences. Quantitative results on achievement scores showed that differences in amount of practice might contribute to explaining the conflicting findings in the literature. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of participant mouse-click histories illustrated participant use of elimination strategies to redefine the 4-option tasks, while participant think-alouds revealed the increased boredom and fatigue induced by the extra amount of practice. This study thus contributes to the debate on the effects of different types of computerized feedback and the development of hybrid and online language learning programs, while underscoring the importance of triangulating data from multiple sources.",

    "description": "Since its inception, form-focused instruction (FFI) has been associated with grammar, with only a handful of studies examining its potential for vocabulary development (e.g., Laufer, 2006). Meanwhile, there has been an unresolved dispute between the two approaches of Focus on Form (FonF) and Focus on Forms (FonFs) in terms of their degree of efficiency. This classroom-based study sought to identify the most efficient FFI-driven approach in tapping learners' lexical as well as comprehension gains by drawing largely on the protocols provided in Ellis (2008) and Laufer (2005). Eighty-eight Iranian students in four intact classes at Allameh Tabataba'i University (two FonF, one FonFs and one meaning-focused) were presented with a series of teacher-designed mini-lessons. Their medium of exposure was video podcasts (newscasts). Students' gains were measured by active immediate and delayed vocabulary and comprehension tests. A series of between-groups multivariate analyses of variance revealed that both FonF groups outperformed the FonFs in terms of all three variables. This indicates that the tendency to analyze words in isolation, despite intensive rehearsals typical of FonFs, failed to outweigh the FonF conditions in which contextual associations are prioritized. The findings of the study could provide useful avenues for FFI-driven vocabulary learning and instruction.",

Visual-syntactic text formatting (VSTF) technology, which visualizes syntactic structures, was used to convert a textbook to the one with syntactic enhancement. The sample (n = 282), which was drawn from a larger study conducted in Southern California, was a mixed population of English proficiency levels: low-proficiency L2 students (n = 113) and high-proficiency L2 students (n =169). Over a school year, VSTF students read their English language arts (ELA) textbooks in VSTF on their laptops and control students read their regular block-formatted textbooks either on their laptops or in print. Observations and interviews revealed that VSTF reading facilitated student engagement in ELA instruction by drawing students' attention to syntactic structures. The results of the California Standard Tests (CST) before and after the intervention were examined to evaluate participants' learning outcomes. Although high-proficiency students did not show a significant improvement on the post-test, low-proficiency made significant gains on two subtests of the CST: written conventions and writing strategies. These findings suggest that VSTF reading may facilitate improving syntactic awareness, which is essential for L2 students to develop their English reading and writing skills in academic contexts.",

    "description": "This study examined factors affecting perception training of vowel duration in L2 Japanese with transfer to production. In a pre-test, training, post-test design, 48 L1 English speakers were assigned to one of three groups: auditory-visual (AV) training using waveform displays, auditory-only (A-only), or no training. Within-group variables were vowel, preceding consonant, pitch pattern, and training talker's voice. Perception pre- and post-tests measured identification accuracy and response time (RT). Training involved eight sessions with feedback, including waveforms for the AV group. Results indicated significant improvement for the AV and A-only groups with generalization to novel stimuli and a new voice as well as transfer to production; the AV group showed a greater rate of improvement. Participants found waveform displays very helpful. Vowel type, preceding consonant, and pitch pattern significantly affected perception in testing and training as did the training talker's voice. The easiest pitch pattern was Low-High in the first syllable, perhaps reflecting English prosodic preference, and High--High in the second, which may be more salient. Perception was facilitated by talkers demonstrating greater pitch movement. Accuracy and RTs increased after training; participants reported spending more time evaluating post-training input. Results support the perception-production link, and the role of variable talker- and context-dependent perceptual categories.",

A good connection design requires the engineer to have a solid understanding of the mechanics and steel behavior. To help students better understand various connection types, many schools have acquired steel sculptures. A steel sculpture is a physical system that shows 48 types of connection found in standard construction practices. Unfortunately, because of its size and location, students do not always have easy access to it. The virtual sculpture described in the article can provide an effective learning alternative. It allows the students to see the sculpture from multiple points of view anywhere, anytime and shows the close-up view of each connection with description of how it may be used, potential failure modes, sample calculations, and field examples. Findings from a formative study with engineering students support the pedagogical efficacy of the interactive sculpture.",

    "description": "One of the challenges of learning Japanese as a Second Language (JSL) is finding the appropriate word for a particular usage. To address this challenge, we developed a collocational aid designed to suggest more appropriate collocations in Japanese. In particular, we address the problem of generating and ranking noun and verb candidates for correcting potential collocation errors in the learners' text. Given a noun-verb construction as input, our system generates possible noun or verb correction candidates based on noun and verb corrections extracted from a large Japanese learner corpus. We use this corpus to investigate the learner's tendency to commit collocation errors, and to produce a smaller and more realistic set of candidates. After combining nouns or verbs with the generated candidates to form noun-verb pairs, the system uses the Weighted Dice coefficient as the association measure to filter out inappropriate noun-verb pairs and rank the proper collocations. We report the detailed evaluation and results on learner data. In addition, we show that our system statistically outperforms existing approaches to collocation error correction. Finally, we report a preliminary user study with JSL learners.",

    "description": "This study utilized a theory proposed by Mohan, Slater, Luo, and Jaipal (2002) regarding the Developmental Path of Cause to investigate AWE score use in classroom contexts. This &quot;path&quot; has the potential to support validity arguments because it suggests how causal linguistic features can be organized in hierarchical order. Utilization of this path enabled this study to investigate AWE scores by comparing them to ratings based on teachers' intuitions as well as to scores based on assignment rubrics. Qualitative focus group data suggested that the path can help teachers articulate their intuitions. Quantitative results showed that the grades provided by raters trained to use the path tended to support AWE scores from Criterion, a web-based AWE system, more strongly than did rubric-generated grades. The findings from this study suggest that Criterion scores not only closely correlated with teachers' intuitions and with raters trained to use the path, but that the use of the path for teaching may support the implementation of AWE systems in classroom contexts, and would help students focus on the core of a cause-effect essay: appropriateness and sophistication of causal language.",

    "description": "One means of sustaining school operations when a disaster makes school buildings inaccessible or inoperable for an extended period of time is to use online and other communication technology to temporarily provide online schooling, also known as emergency online schools. However, the current literature on emergency online schools suggests that fully functioning emergency online schools are possible only through thoughtful planning and development before a disaster strikes. As a result, this article addresses the prospect of rapid development of emergency online schools in situations when schools are closed or inaccessible for a long period of time due to a disaster or other emergency, and there is no emergency online or other alternative school plan currently in place. We posit herein that although a fully functioning emergency online school is likely possible only through thoughtful planning and development, some of the key virtues of emergency online schools are, nevertheless, attainable after a disaster or other emergency necessitates complete school closure. We offer a plan for &quot;rapid&quot; establishment of an emergency online school as a &quot;response&quot; to a disaster &quot;after&quot; a disaster has happened and when complete school closure or inaccessibility was not anticipated as part of the current school crisis response plan and a comprehensive emergency online school plan is not yet established. This article first outlines the resources necessary for rapid creation of emergency online schools then follows with an approach to rapidly instituting emergency online schools as a response after disaster strikes.",

    "author": "Bodnar, Stephen, Cucchiarini, Catia, Strik, Helmer, van Hout, Roeland",
    "description": "A major aim of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is to create computer environments that facilitate students' second language (L2) acquisition. To achieve this aim, CALL employs technological innovations to create novel types of language practice. Evaluations of the new practice types serve the important role of distinguishing effective practice environments from less effective environments, while simultaneously informing educational practices and second language acquisition (SLA) theory. Accordingly, evaluations of CALL systems necessarily deal with multiple criteria. Most researchers would probably agree that motivation is an important criterion in CALL evaluations: a system can provide sufficient L2 input and opportunities for L2 output, yet fail to be pedagogically effective if learners are unwilling to participate. Furthermore, knowledge of the motivational impact of practice can provide valuable context linking individual language learners, practice effort and learning outcomes. From the perspective of recent theoretical developments in L2 motivation theory, this paper surveys a representative sample of CALL system evaluations that include motivational impact. Our analysis suggests not only that CALL needs to do more to align its treatment of motivation with recent L2 motivation theories, but also that it is well positioned to do so. We find that: (1) few CALL studies treat motivation as it relates to practice as a dynamic variable; (2) behavioural practice logs are underexploited; and (3) very few evaluations take into account learners' individual interests and goals. Drawing on these and other findings, we suggest four new directions for developing the motivation dimension in CALL evaluations.",

This study focuses on Busuu, a social networking site for language learning (SNSLL), and analyzes the views of language that are enacted through the semiotic design of this participatory online environment. The study draws on methodological principles of multimodality to examine the website and data collected through auto-ethnographic accounts of the researcher, who participated as a member of the Busuu community for 10 weeks. Results indicate that Busuu is an ecological system composed of nested sub-systems that reflect structural, interactional, and ecological views of language that interweave in conflicting and complementary ways. Suggestions to improve SNSLLs concern the need to reach alignment in terms of the theoretical and pedagogical tenets that underscore the design of instructional materials. Implications pinpoint the potential of intersecting multimodality and CALL in the study of participatory online environments.",

Providing effective vocabulary learning strategies is therefore more valuable than teaching students a large amount of vocabulary. The purpose of this study was to encourage teachers to apply these strategies by using mobile phones and technology to facilitate vocabulary learning. Participants were divided into learner-constructed concept-mapping and text-only strategy groups. The concept-mapping group received the vocabulary instruction according to the concept maps constructed by the students themselves while the other group received the vocabulary in a random order. The research question was as follows: Does mobile English vocabulary learning based on concept-mapping strategy have a significant effect on EFL learners' vocabulary performance? For vocabulary learning acquisition and retention, the concept-mapping group performed significantly superior to the text-only group.",

    "author": "Peterson, Mark",
    "description": "Contemporary CALL research reflects renewed interest in digital games. One aspect of this phenomenon namely, use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), has expanded significantly, highlighting the need for a review. This paper analyzes findings from 10 learner-based studies that draw on accounts of SLA informed by cognitive and sociocultural theories. Analysis reveals that research conducted from the sociocultural perspective provides evidence of constructs identified as playing a central role in SLA. Analysis indicates that playing MMORPGs elicits target language dialogue involving collaboration, assistance and co-construction. Data show that MMORPGs provide access to conditions conducive to the operation of zones of proximal development. Findings show that this type of game provides access to both in-game and extramural communities of practice that facilitate language socialization. Research undertaken from a cognitive perspective shows that participation in MMORPG-based gaming facilitates production of the target language. However, this work does not provide conclusive evidence that game play elicits forms of interaction such as negotiation, that are hypothesized as playing a central role in learning in the cognitive account of SLA. Studies conducted from both perspectives draw attention to positive learner attitudes indicating high levels of motivation. The analysis reveals that although studies are subject to limitations, they have produced promising results. This suggests that further theory-led work in this area is justified, as it offers the prospect of making a significant contribution to the research base. As work continues, areas of potential interest in praxis, theory and future research are identified.",

While it is important that writing instructors assess and provide feedback on learners' causal discourse, it could be a very time-consuming task. In this respect, automated writing evaluation (AWE) tools may be helpful. However, to date, there have been no AWE tools capable of evaluating causal discourse. The authors of the present study attempt to fill in this gap by (1) developing an automated causal discourse analyzer and (2) investigating how accurately the analyzer processes learners' causal discourse in academic writing. The accuracy of the analyzer is evaluated on cause-and-effect essays written by 17 non-native undergraduate students. The results indicate precision of 0.93, recall of 0.71, and accuracy of 0.76, which is promising for pedagogical applications of the analyzer, that is, providing learners with automated formative feedback specific to causal discourse.",

However, much of this research has focused on games using 3D graphic technology, which entail technical requirements that may render them too complex for use in many educational contexts. Accordingly, we wanted to determine if less complex simulation games could also support the acquisition of a foreign language. We conducted a quasi-experiment using whole classes comprising EFL learners at a Japanese university. A treatment group used an online vocabulary learning application (Quizlet) in conjunction with a simple simulation game (3rd World Farmer), and a control group used the vocabulary learning application alone. Although using the simulation game showed no short-term benefit, the treatment group outperformed the control group on a delayed post-test administered 11 weeks after treatment. We conclude that the effect of simulation games can be used in foreign language learning to improve long-term retention of target language vocabulary.",

Participants' pronunciation was evaluated in pretests and posttests. Presurveys and postsurveys assessed attitudes towards pronunciation. Additionally, a questionnaire collected students' reflections on the software, and observations were made during instruction. The greatest increase in performance was achieved by students receiving combined instruction, who also exhibited the greatest (positive) changes towards pronunciation.

    "description": "The purpose of the present paper is twofold; first, we present an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of a novel CALL tool for foreign language vocabulary instruction based on spaced repetition of target vocabulary items. The study demonstrates that by spending an average of three minutes each day on automatically generated vocabulary activities, EFL students increased their long-term vocabulary retention rate three fold. Second, we demonstrate that the double-blind experiment design, which has become standard research practice in such extremely high-stakes fields as pharmacology and healthcare, has the potential of being successfully implemented in CALL research.",

Unlike traditional NLP-based applications that categorize complete documents, the analyzer categorizes every sentence in Introduction section texts as both a communicative move and a rhetorical step. We describe the construction of a cascade of two support vector machine classifiers trained on a multi-disciplinary corpus of annotated texts. This work not only demonstrates the usefulness of NLP for automated genre analysis, but also paves the road for future AWE endeavors and forms of automated feedback that could facilitate effective expression of functional meaning in writing.",

    "description": "Thanks to natural language processing technologies, computer programs are actively being used not only for holistic scoring, but also for formative evaluation of writing. CyWrite is one such program that is under development. The program is built upon Second Language Acquisition theories and aims to assist ESL learners in higher education by providing them with effective formative feedback to facilitate autonomous learning and improvement of their writing skills. In this study, we focus on CyWrite's capacity to detect grammatical errors in student writing. We specifically report on (1) computational and pedagogical approaches to the development of the tool in terms of students' grammatical accuracy, and (2) the performance of our grammatical analyzer. We evaluated the performance of CyWrite on a corpus of essays written by ESL undergraduate students with regards to four types of grammatical errors: quantifiers, subject-verb agreement, articles, and run-on sentences. We compared CyWrite's performance at detecting these errors to the performance of a well-known commercially available AWE tool, Criterion. Our findings demonstrated better performance metrics of our tool as compared to Criterion, and a deeper analysis of false positives and false negatives shed light on how CyWrite's performance can be improved.",

    "author": "Quixal, Mart\u00ed, Meurers, Detmar",
    "description": "The paper tackles a central question in the field of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL): How can language learning tasks be conceptualized and made explicit in a way that supports the pedagogical goals of current Foreign Language Teaching and Learning and at the same time provides an explicit characterization of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) requirements for providing feedback to learners completing those tasks? We argue that the successful implementation of language learning tasks that can be automatically assessed demands a design process in which both pedagogical and computational requirements feed each other. Extending well-established work in Task-Based Instruction (TBI) and Language Testing, we propose a framework that helps us (a) elucidate the formal features of foreign language learning activities, (b) characterize the relation between the expected and the actually elicited learner language, and (c) assess how the variability in the learner responses impacts interpretation and computational techniques for the automatic analysis of learner language. To validate our approach we apply the framework to two writing tasks for learners of English as a foreign language. Our analysis highlights the relevance of spelling out the pedagogical and linguistic goals of language learning tasks in order to successfully characterize the language expected and actually elicited in learner responses, to evaluate the realization of the task, and to support the design of effective NLP strategies. Given the combination of design- and data-driven perspectives, the framework supports an iterative approach to the creation of language learning tasks and ICALL materials.",

    "description": "While the majority of people in Ireland speak English as a first language, the minority Irish language is spoken daily by approximately 3% of the population even though is a compulsory subject in Irish schools. Recent research has shown the language to be in crisis, with consistently declining standards of attainment in schools. This paper presents the first cycle of an Action Research project aiming to assess the potential of using a three-dimensional virtual environment (3DVE) as a platform for task-based learning of Irish in the primary school. The action phase of the cycle consisted of an intensive pilot of a language learning intervention using a 3DVE (n = 25 children aged 9-10 years). The reflection component was multiphase, involving analysis of pilot outputs, re-evaluation of the literature and an in-depth user consultation (n = 15 children aged 10-11 years), inspired by Student Voice methodology. The user consultation findings indicated goal orientation as the primary driver for children learning in a 3DVE with social connectivity understood as a given in any such environment. This paper offers a novel classification of games and virtual worlds for language learning which serves to integrate the two research literatures in a meaningful way.",

    "description": "Private online language tutoring is growing in popularity. An important prerequisite for development of effective pedagogies in this context is a good understanding of how different modalities can be combined. This study provides a detailed account of how several experienced private online teachers use text chat in their Skype-based English lessons, and the pedagogical role and interactional effect of these interactions. The study investigates the relationship between characteristics of a text message and students' observable reaction to this message. The study employs a sequential Qualitative-Quantitative design and finds that text chat serves pedagogical and organizational roles in the analyzed context and that several characteristics of a text message were correlated with students' reaction to messages. Specifically, students were more likely to incorporate a text message if: (a) it introduced new vocabulary, and (b) if it was produced bimodally (speaking and typing). The study also finds that teacher typing may have a negative effect on students' fluency and teachers' attention to student language production. The study calls for further research to investigate how written and spoken channels can be effectively combined in one-to-one English lessons via video/audio conferencing lessons.",

In addition, the study identifies the characteristics of the participants' (n = 7) preferred apps and aims to determine if the participants were able to make gains in vocabulary recall and listening comprehension after a six-month period of independent language learning. The results of this study indicate that the children and their parents established rituals and clear guidelines for playing on the iPad as a means to provide language-learning opportunities. Additionally, they were able to demonstrate moderate gains in vocabulary recall and listening comprehension.",

    "description": "The relationship between computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and second language acquisition (SLA) has been studied both extensively, covering numerous subdomains, and intensively, resulting in hundreds of primary studies. It is therefore no surprise that CALL researchers, as in other areas of applied linguistics, have turned in recent years to meta-analysis as a means to synthesize quantitative results across studies. To date, nearly 30 CALL-SLA syntheses and meta-analyses have been conducted, covering topics from hypertext glosses (Yun, 2011) to synchronous computer-mediated communication (Ziegler, 2015) to game-based learning (Chiu, Kao, &amp; Reynolds, 2012). Despite these individual contributions, the overall effects of CALL on SLA across domains have yet to be addressed. In this &quot;second-order&quot; review, we provide a thorough account of substantive findings and a critical description and evaluation of methodological practices of CALL-SLA meta-analyses. We begin by describing the generally substantial effects of CALL on L2 learning along with an examination of different types of technology such as CALL glosses and computer-mediated communication (CMC). Results of the methodological review reveal wide variability overall and in several practices associated with rigor, transparency, and utility of meta-analytic reviews. At the close of our article, we provide empirically identified recommendations for future primary and meta-analytic research.",

To be discussed are both how technology has been used to conduct research on SLA processes and what the impacts of technology have been as a mediator of those processes. As we progress into the 21st century, I suggest that technology in SLA research will assume an increasingly greater role, approaching Bax's (2003, 2011) notion of &quot;normalization&quot; for the field of computer-assisted language learning, namely that technology is gradually being fully integrated into second language teaching, learning, and research. In addition, I propose that SLA research investigate not only the traditional aspects of linguistic and communicative competence but newer types of &quot;symbolic competence&quot; (e.g., Kramsch, 2011) and &quot;intercultural communicative competence&quot; (e.g., Byram, 1997), which include integral technological components, and which are a part of general &quot;digital literacies&quot; or &quot;multiliteracies.&quot;",

    "description": "&quot;Language Learning &amp; Technology&quot; (&quot;LLT&quot;) was launched in the mid-1990s out of a collaboration between the University of Hawai'i National Foreign Language Resource Center (NFLRC) and the Michigan State University Center for Language Education Research (CLEAR). Like other online journals started in the 1990s, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to enhance the speed of publication and the accessibility of published research. Yet &quot;LLT&quot; had an additional goal: to raise the rigor of published research in its targeted area. Thus, rather than seeking to be defined principally by its mode or style of publication, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to be the highest quality journal in an emerging area of inquiry. This sounds like an obvious goal, but &quot;LLT&quot; was going against the grain. By the time the first issue of &quot;LLT&quot; appeared in 1997, there was already a popular notion of a dichotomy between print journals (which alone printed rigorous peer reviewed research) and online journals (which were accessible but not rigorously reviewed). Indeed, at the time, many academics refused to submit work to online journals, believing (or knowing) that their institutions would fail to recognize articles published in online venues. To break out of this stereotype, &quot;LLT&quot; recruited a top notch editorial board, including leading applied linguistics from around the world. For its inaugural issue in July 1997, the journal invited internationally recognized applied linguistics to submit papers on the topic Language Learning &amp; Technology: Defining the Research Agenda. The resources of the NFLRC and CLEAR were used to achieve broad publicity. &quot;LLT&quot; quickly gathered broad attention. With questions of funding, peer review, and other matters still under debate, the future of academic journal publishing is very much in flux. When the history of the transition from print to online publishing is written, the important role of &quot;LLT&quot; should be noted as one of the first journals to demonstrate that publishing exclusively on the Internet was fully compatible with being among the best academic journals in the world.",

Research in computer-mediated communication has shown that interaction opportunities make learners pay attention to form in a variety of ways that promote L2 learning. This research has mostly investigated text-based rather than voice-based interaction. The present study applied &quot;form-focusing information gap tasks&quot; (Pica, Kang, &amp; Sauro, 2006) to a voice-based computer-mediated environment and investigated whether individual or interactive task performance conditions affect language development differently. This is a relevant research question for distance language learning programs, which are primarily asynchronous and largely rely on individual performance and text-based communication. The results of the study showed significant pre-to-post learning gains under both performance conditions (individual and interactive). Between-groups comparisons further showed that participants in the interactive condition outperformed participants in the individual condition on two of the three target structures investigated.",

    "description": "The present study investigated how 6 Korean ESL graduate students in Canada used a suite of freely available reference resources, consisting of Web-based corpus tools, Google search engines, and dictionaries, for solving linguistic problems while completing an authentic academic writing assignment in English. Using a mixed methods design, the study examined the processes and outcomes of combined use of concordancers and other reference resources by the participants and their perceptions of the reference suite as a means of writing assistance. Results showed that while the reference suite served as an effective cognitive tool extending the cognitive powers of the participants in solving lexical and grammatical problems, the individual resources in the suite were each shown to have unique functions for which they were best suited, suggesting that concordancing may optimally be consulted in combination with other resources. However, some participants also experienced difficulties in using the tool stemming largely from the nature of their writing tasks and writing stages, and different goals and needs arising from them. This paper concludes by discussing theoretical and pedagogical implications of the findings.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effect of repeated in-class web-based collaborative writing tasks on second language writers' (L2) individual writing scores. A pre-test post-test research model was used in addition to participant surveys, class observations, and teacher interviews. Participants included 59 L2 writers in a writing class at a large U.S. university. The 32 participants in the experimental group engaged in four in-class web-based collaborative writing tasks, while the 27 participants in the control group engaged in the same four in-class web-based writing tasks but individually. A paired samples t-test revealed that both groups experienced statistically significant gains from their pre- to posttest scores. An independent sample t-test of pre- to post-test gains revealed that the participants in the collaborative web-based writing group experienced statistically significant writing gains in their individual writing over the participants in the individual web-based writing group. Participant survey results showed that the L2 writers valued the collaborative in-class writing tasks overall and that many participants in the individual group wished they had done in-class collaborative web-based writing. Three types of collaborative groups emerged. Pedagogical implications for technology-enhanced collaborative writing are discussed, and a Teaching Cycle for Web-Based Collaborative Writing is introduced.",

Our multi-scale sociocultural-dialogical analysis of the interactional order in the online sessions of an &quot;Italian for Beginners&quot; language course provided by a university in Sweden is illustrated in terms of an Introduction phase, a Language and Grammar phase, a Discussion phase, and a Concluding phase. Dimensions of TimeSpace shape the organization of the lessons where a range of literacy practices can be identified. A second step in the analysis zooms into the Discussion phase. Taking the concepts of epistemic engine and epistemic domains as points of departure, we explain how the written word shapes the interactional order in online settings. This study highlights how different interactional orders allow for the opening up of new socialization spaces, in which students are more likely to be prevented from getting trapped in their own script of task-oriented activities. Here, participants' cultural processes are complexly layered in digitally-mediated encounters, where their focused orientation towards a variety of offline and online oral and written resources is partly curtailed by the digital environment itself.",

Absent in this vision of language are notions of pragmatic, sociolinguistic, and multicultural competencies. Although current linguistic theories posit a more complex, interactive, and integrated model of language, this review article points out where computer-assisted language learning (CALL) can contribute to L2 language growth in terms of these four skills, especially if carefully situated within a task-based language teaching (TBLT) framework. New technologies coupled with a TBLT goal-oriented approach ultimately push learners to combine speaking, listening, reading, and writing in ways that resemble more closely how they normally engage with the digital facets of their own lives.",

To that end, four-skill-integrated tasks and digital tools were incorporated into the coursework. Data were collected using midterm reflections, post-surveys and final interviews from two online elementary language courses. The results indicate that the types of tasks and digital tools utilized fostered learner autonomy in different ways. Structured tasks enabled students to work independently to create content, whereas open-ended tasks allowed them more freedom in exploring the understanding of a particular topic through social interaction. Significantly, teacher scaffolding through modeling and timely feedback affected student self-regulated efforts in online learning. The study concludes that personal commitment to the coursework and cognitive engagement with the learning material contributed to the degree of learning autonomy and the level of social interaction in fully online language learning.",

Their commentary then focuses on the features and the methodology that made Cultura a pioneer in web-based, intercultural exchanges for foreign language instruction. The components that may account for Cultura's longevity are its clear pedagogical design and the contrastive process which nurtures student involvement, both online and in the classroom. One of the best-known and frequently replicated features of Cultura is the introduction of intercultural, on-line questionnaires. However, the authors feel that limiting the use of Cultura to those questionnaires is not only reductionist but it can also be counterproductive because, when used alone, the questionnaires accentuate a simplistic, binary approach to culture. Understanding another culture requires that students explore a large variety of other materials and articulate a multiplicity of viewpoints, undertaking the analysis of even the most contradictory ones. Given the numerous Web 2.0 social networking tools which have since been developed, it can be hoped that some of Cultura, particularly its asynchronous forums and the unique features that have given it its enduring appeal and strength, will be preserved.",

The 30 CSL beginners who participated in this study were randomly divided into two groups (n = 15 per group), required to perform two different types of language tasks: information-gap and reasoning-gap. During the study, both the Mandarin oral accuracy and the learning motivation of both groups were measured and analyzed to determine to what extent performing the two different task types could contribute to the two dependent variables (i.e., accuracy and motivation). All the learners improved significantly in oral communication competence, with those performing the reasoning-gap task improving significantly more than those performing the information-gap task. It was also found that almost all the learners exhibited positive learning motivation and appreciated the task-based learning activities designed in SL. Both groups made significant improvement in the affective dimension. Furthermore, the reasoning-gap group received significantly higher scores in the educational-context-related dimension (attitude toward SL as the Mandarin Chinese learning environment) than the information-gap group did.",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "&quot;Ready access to travel and to technology-enhanced social networking (e.g., Facebook or Skype) has changed the nature of study abroad to the point where today's experiences are fundamentally different from those of earlier eras&quot; (Kinginger, 2013a, p. 345). In addition to more travel options and greater technology availability, study abroad has changed in other significant ways. In the US, more students are going abroad for short-term programs (less than 8 weeks), and the participants represent more diverse academic fields, with an increasing number of students from the sciences, social sciences, and business-related fields. The image of the North American student going abroad primarily for language learning, spending a semester or more, no longer fits reality. In fact, many students now engage in service learning, internships, or volunteer work while abroad. Nevertheless, study abroad remains an expected experience for students with a serious interest in language learning. In this column we will be looking at the varied roles that technology can play in the study abroad experience. Some argue that the availability of Internet-based social media while abroad is for language learning and cross-cultural understanding at best a distraction and at worst an inhibitor of full engagement in the target culture, inevitably leading to less exposure to the target language and therefore fewer opportunities for language proficiency gains. The author argues that in fact, technology can play a positive role, particularly if students are provided with appropriate guidance and support. The main areas to be discussed are the personal and learning benefits of technology use while abroad, the formation of second-language identities, the affordances for pragmatic language development, the integration of mobile devices for place-based language learning, and the opportunities for enhancement of intercultural communication competence.",

Participants were 163 second-year English majors from a university located in Sichuan province who wrote 326 essays from two writing prompts. Each paper was marked by four human raters as well as &quot;WriteToLearn.&quot; Many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) was conducted to calibrate &quot;WriteToLearn&quot;'s rating performance in scoring the whole set of essays against those of four trained human raters. In addition, the accuracy of WriteToLearn's feedback on 60 randomly selected essays was compared with the feedback provided by human raters. The two main findings related to scoring were that: (1) &quot;WriteToLearn&quot; was more consistent but highly stringent when compared to the four trained human raters in scoring essays; and (2) &quot;WriteToLearn&quot; failed to score seven essays. In terms of error feedback, &quot;WriteToLearn&quot; had an overall precision and recall of 49% and 18.7% respectively. These figures did not meet the minimum threshold of 90% precision (set by Burstein, Chodorow, and Leacock, 2003) for it to be considered a reliable error detecting tool. Furthermore, it had difficulty in identifying errors made by Chinese undergraduate English majors in the use of articles, prepositions, word choice and expression.",

The return on investment levels of measure for the three technologies were also compared with groups that did not use any form of IWB. Analyses revealed small but significant differences between forms of technology in three of the four levels of measure: satisfaction, student achievement, and perception of results.

The students' responses to each question were scrutinized by using the Delphi concept inventory, heuristic-analytic theory, and neo-Piagetian theory of cognitive development for qualitative data analysis. Moreover, the motivation for this exploratory study was to also address the misconceptions that students held in programming and help educators to redefine the teaching methods to correct those alternative conceptions. Student misconceptions were spotted in list referencing and inbuilt functions in Python. In a further quantitative analysis, the study found that students who had misconceptions made knowledge errors and failed to complete the coding tasks.

    "description": "Pragmatic competence is essential for oral fluency and listening comprehension, allowing speakers to use and interpret language appropriately in varied contexts. The use of technological applications for teaching pragmatics is on the rise (Taguchi &amp; Sykes, 2013), in part because they are well-suited to the types of awareness-raising tasks which support Schmidt's (1993; 2001) noticing hypothesis. However, the effectiveness of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) applications in the teaching of routine formulas--phrases with pragmatic functions--has yet to be examined. This paper reports on the impact of an awareness-raising, corpus-referred instructional website on L1 English learners' acquisition of nine Russian routine formulas. Intermediate and advanced learners of Russian were recruited and assigned to either the experimental (n = 18) or control (n = 16) group. All participants completed an oral proficiency assessment, a background questionnaire, and a pre-test, post-test (two weeks after the pre-test) and delayed post-test (four weeks after the post-test) that assessed comprehension, use, and aural recognition of the routine formulas. Experimental group participants completed the web-based modules and responded to a feedback form. Results indicate that the intervention had a durable effect on learners' awareness of the targeted routine formulas and lowered aural recognition of nonce formulas.",

Several topics have been re-examined in regular intervals of approximately five years, namely digital literacy (Vol. 4, Num. 2; Vol. 10, Num. 2; Vol. 14, Num. 3; Vol. 19, Num. 3) and web technologies (Vol. 1, Num. 2; Vol. 4, Num. 1; Vol. 9, Num. 2; Vol. 14, Num. 1). Many columns have encompassed more than one area of technology or pointed to multiple possible uses in language learning. In this article, Godwin-Jones examines three general themes which emerge among the columns written since 1997: (1) the fundamental affordances of technology for language learning (skills or components of language acquisition, digital literacy, learner autonomy); (2) teaching and learning contexts and approaches (online learning, social media, tutorial CALL); and (3) delivery and design considerations (technology standards, web design, mobile devices, multimedia). Based on his analysis, he concludes that the topics covered in the 20 years of the column mirror broadly developments in the field of CALL. These include a surge in interest in social media and informal language learning, with an accompanying decreased interest in dedicated software for acquiring specific language skills.",

    "description": "This study investigates the effects of multimedia glosses on text recall and incidental vocabulary learning in a mobile-assisted L2 listening task. A total of 88 participants with a low level of proficiency in English were randomly assigned to one of four conditions that involved single channel (textual-only, pictorial-only) and dual-channel (textual-plus-pictorial) glosses as well as a control condition where no glosses were provided. The participants listened to a story through their mobile phones and were engaged in an immediate free recall task and unannounced vocabulary tests after listening. The findings indicated that access to glosses facilitated recognition and production of vocabulary with the type of gloss having no effect. On the other hand, glosses had no effect on text recall.",

    "description": "Despite the accumulated body of research on teaching English as an international language (EIL), few have offered a detailed overview of how to implement an EIL classroom, and still fewer empirical studies have been conducted. Twenty-one university students at a Japanese university participated in the study in the spring semester of 2015. The videoconference-embedded classroom (VEC) as an instructional intervention was implemented for 14 weeks: (1) pre-videoconference task (i.e. reading and presenting/discussing EIL issues) (11 weeks), (2) during-videoconference task (i.e. interacting online with EIL experts from three circle countries) (2 weeks), and (3) post-videoconference task (i.e. writing/presenting the final term paper on EIL issues) (1 week). Using a mixed research method consisting of a questionnaire, post-course class evaluations in spring 2014 (without VEC) and spring 2015 (with VEC), and in-class observations, VEC was found to have important pedagogical benefits as it created an interactive learning environment and deepened the understanding of the EIL content. Additionally, 81% of the participants had positive perceptions of EIL. Pedagogically, practitioners can implement EIL ideas using VEC pedagogy at the instructional level. Theoretically, it can also add new empirical findings to the field, which may help bridge a discrepancy between theory and practice.",

    "description": "This study is an attempt to investigate the effect of metacognitive instruction through dialogic interaction in a joint activity on advanced Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' multimedia listening and their metacognitive awareness in listening comprehension. The data were collected through (N = 180) male and female Iranian advanced learners ranging from 16 to 24 years of age in three groups. The first two groups were experimental (n = 60), trained through a structured intervention program focusing on metacognitive instruction through dialogic interaction (MIDI) and metacognitive instruction (MI) for 10 sessions. The learners in the experimental group were involved in 60 minutes of practice twice a week. The third group was a control group (n = 60), trained through regular classroom listening activities without receiving the structured intervention program. Multimedia listening tests and the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ) were used to track the advanced learners' multimedia listening comprehension and metacognitive awareness. The results showed that metacognitive instruction through dialogic interaction did improve both the advanced learners' multimedia listening comprehension and their metacognitive awareness in listening.",

    "description": "This paper reports on the cognitive and affective benefits of data-driven learning (DDL), in which Korean EFL learners at the secondary level notice and unlearn their &quot;overgenerated 'be'&quot; by comparing native English-speaker and learner corpora with guided induction. To select the target language item and compile learner-corpus-based materials, writing samples of 285 learners were collected. The participants were randomly divided into traditional grammar learning and DDL groups. After providing instruction for each group, one immediate and one delayed writing sessions were implemented. Revealing a lower ratio of overgenerated &quot;be&quot; after the instruction than the control group, the DDL group showed statistically significant retention as well as immediate effects in terms of the raw counts of the target item. Based on this improvement in grammar learning and retention, DDL is considered helpful for these learners as it facilitated their efforts to discover and apply rules. In addition, their positive attitudes toward DDL including both native speaker and learner data provide useful pedagogical implications. Learning from the negative evidence produced in their own classroom helped learners, especially at lower levels, to raise their grammar consciousness and boost their motivation to learn.",

    "title": "Innovative Assessment of Aviation English in a Virtual World: Windows into Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies",
    "author": "Park, Moonyoung",
    "description": "Aviation English proficiency is a core competency in the global air traffic controller profession. There is, however, growing concern about the current ineffective paper-based assessment methods and the severe lack of interactive online testing for such a critical profession, one that should be ideally assessed in an authentic task and situation (Alderson, 2010; Douglas, 2013). The tests, which lack validity and authenticity, cannot capture how knowledge of aviation English communication and strategic competence are used through valid means and, therefore, inevitably fail to predict how test takers actually perform in the target language use situations (Douglas, 2000). In the present study, the researcher examines the potential use of verbal report data produced by test takers interacting in a virtual testing environment. The research seeks to answer two specific questions: (a) What types of strategies are used in the virtual aviation English task performance? and (b) How can the assessed strategies be interpreted in relation to test takers' performance? The analysis of the test takers' verbal reports from stimulated recalls indicates that various cognitive, metacognitive, and communication strategies were used while performing the Virtual Interactive Tasks for Aviation English Assessment, and that there is a positive relationship between the total number of cognitive and metacognitive strategies adopted and the test scores. The findings suggest that the use of an immersive interface and simulated tasks in a virtual world could provide language learners with more authentic opportunities to perform the target tasks and promote strategic, as well as linguistic, competence.",

    "author": "Yang, Rong",
    "description": "In this digital era, online intercultural exchange has gained increased popularity in language and culture education. However, concerns arise over its productiveness and efficacy in engaging participants cognitively. In addition, there is a paucity of research on out-of-classroom synchronous online exchange projects, let alone those involving Chinese English learners and English-speaking Chinese learners. Guided by the social constructivist theory, this study examined the productiveness of a small-scale intercultural online exchange project from its quality dimension measured by the participants' use of questions. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of the dynamics and educational value of online synchronous text communication in language and culture learning. Participants were six English learners from China and six English-speaking Chinese learners from the U.S. Unlike many previous intercultural exchanges, this project was entirely independent from the curricula on both sides. Within a certain time frame, participants chose when and where exactly the synchronous text chat took place. Data analyses focused on the self-generated questions found in chat logs. Although participants seemed to self-generate more lower-order than higher-order thinking questions, the latter were frequently used in the process of online discussion to engage learners from both sides in critical thinking and self-reflection. Differences in the use of questions were found across dyads, languages, and groups of participants. Implications for future research and project design were discussed.",

    "description": "Discussion lists have gained a significant popularity in professional development research over the past few decades for the opportunity they provide for asynchronous interaction. This article presents findings from a small-scale case study that aimed at exploring the nature of teachers' asynchronous exchanges in a discussion list. The data comprised the archived log of the messages in a Yahoo Group discussion list by five in-service English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers who volunteered to take part in a hybrid computer-assisted language learning (CALL) teacher education course in a state university in Iran. The discussion list was incorporated into the course to engage participants in professional dialogue on topics related to technology/CALL. During the initial data analysis, participants' asynchronous exchanges were grouped as suggestions, questions, unclassified, answers, and delivery, drawing upon Oriogun and Cave's (2008) SQUAD categorization, following the constant comparative method of analysis. Through a follow-up computer-mediated discourse analysis, cognitive, social, and teaching presence functional moves were identified in the data. Participants used the space not only for socializing and peer instruction but also for constructing knowledge. Despite an uneven pattern of contribution, asynchronous exchanges provided opportunities for knowledge construction at different levels of cognitive presence on topics ranging from technology tools and their affordances/constraints to computer-assisted language testing, materials development, and classroom management. The findings provide CALL teacher education researchers and course designers insights into the potential of asynchronous interaction for online and blended language teacher education.",

    "description": "Compared to traditional pen-and-paper presentation of information, computer-assisted argument mapping seems to be more efficient in developing lower order thinking skills such as memory and comprehension. The present study investigated the impact of argument map construction and reading via computer versus pen and paper on English as a foreign language (EFL) majors' comprehension, recall, and retention of argumentative texts. To this end, 120 Iranian EFL undergraduates were divided into low and high proficiency levels after taking a language proficiency test. Next, they were randomly assigned to two experimental groups; each group received 12 sessions of argument mapping instruction, one via computer and the other via pen and paper. At the end of the term, participants randomly received two argument map sizes (small vs. large) and were given 15 minutes to read the maps. Then tests of recall and comprehension relevant to the maps were administered, followed by a test of retention within a two-week interval. The results revealed that after controlling for spatial and verbal covariates, the type of treatment had a significant effect on recall, retention, and comprehension, with the software group outperforming the pen-and-paper group; however, proficiency level and argument size did not show any significant effect.",

A number of authors have hypothesised about the effects of anonymity when foreign language interactions are conducted via VWs. This study addresses the effect that the anonymity experienced in VW interaction may have on participants that present different affective profiles. The participants are 18 students (five male, 13 female) aged between 19 and 20 years old and registered in a Spanish undergraduate degree at the University of Roehampton (London). They were involved in four tandem oral interaction activities in the VW Second Life with a group of native Spanish students from the Universidad de C\u00e1diz (Spain). A mixed-methods research design with quantitative and qualitative data was applied. Data were collected about the participants' foreign language anxiety (FLA) levels, self-efficacy beliefs, and psychological profile (introvert/extrovert). Participants were also asked to answer three open-ended questions about how they felt during the interaction in the VW. The results obtained reveal a strong relationship between self-efficacy beliefs and the anonymity effect experienced by students, although no correlation was found between the participants' FLA levels or personality profiles and their experience of the anonymity afforded by the VW.",

    "author": "Sert, Olcay, Balaman, Ufuk",
    "description": "Recent research shows that negotiation of meaning in online task-oriented interactions can be a catalyst for L2 (second/foreign/additional language) development. However, how learners undertake such negotiation work and what kind of an impact it has on interactional development in an L2 are still largely unknown mainly due to a lack of focus on task engagement processes. A conversation analytic investigation into negotiation of meaning (NoM) in task-oriented interactions can bring evidence to such development, as conversation analysis (CA), given its analytic tools, allows us to see how participant orientations in interaction evolve over time. Based on an examination of screen-recorded multiparty online task-oriented interactions, this study aimed to describe how users (n=8) of an L2 (1) negotiate and co-construct language and task rules and (2) later show orientations to these rules both in the short term (50 minutes) and in the long term (8 weeks). The findings showed that in addition to negotiating existing rules, the learners co-constructed new rules around an action called policing, which occurred when the learners attended to the breach of language and task rules. Furthermore, even after the negotiation work was completed, they oriented to negotiated rules through policing their own utterances (i.e. self-policing). Overall, this interactional continuum (from other-repairs to self-repairs) brought longitudinal evidence to bear on the role of NoM in the development of L2 interactional competence. These findings bring new insights into NoM, technology-mediated task-based language teaching (TBLT), and CA for second language acquisition (SLA).",

An understanding of research design benefts and limitations is timely for those exploring how interaction occurs between users, and users and the virtual space, and how these interactions make sense within a broader theoretical framework. As a frst step, the article describes the types of interaction that are signifcant to classroom-based research studies, such as learner--learner. This is followed by a historical overview of research approaches and methods used in interaction studies, from early quantitative, to descriptive and qualitative, to mixed-method approaches. Following this overview, the author critically surveys research approaches, methods, analytical tools, and data collection techniques used in physical and virtual second language classroom interaction studies. The article concludes by highlighting the implications and research considerations for the design of new research studies in 3DVLEs.",

    "description": "The study of multimodality in communication has attracted the attention of researchers studying online multimodal environments such as virtual worlds. Specifically, 3D virtual worlds have especially attracted the interest of educators and academics due to the multiplicity of verbal channels, which are often comprised of text and voice channels, as well as their 3D graphical interface, allowing for the study of non-verbal modes. This study offers a multilayered transcription method called the Multi-Modal MUVE Method or 3M Method (Palomeque, 2016; Pujol\u00e0 &amp; Palomeque, 2010) to account for the different modes present in the 3D virtual world of Second Life. This method works at two levels: the macro and the micro level. The macro level is a bird's-eye view representation of the whole session as it fits into one page. This enables the researcher to grasp the essence of the class and to identify interesting sequences for analysis. The micro level consists of three transcripts to account for the different communication modes as well as the interface activity that occurs in the virtual world of Second Life. This paper will review the challenges when dealing with multimodal analysis in virtual worlds and how the multimodal data were analyzed and interpreted by using a multilayered multimodal method of analysis (3M transcription). Examples will be provided in the study to show how different modes of communication were used by participants in the virtual world of Second Life to create meaning or to avoid communication breakdowns.",

    "description": "The possibility of exploiting technology for more robust and meaningful learning and teaching has invoked messianic responses from the language education community. Yet to be explored are teachers' pedagogical choices based on the perceived technological affordances as well as interactions between teacher and student agency mediated by these affordances in the ecology of a classroom. This qualitative case study adopts an ecological approach, aiming to address rather than factor out the broader social context in a physical classroom. With data collected from 30 hours of classroom observation and 10 post-observation interviews with the participant teacher, the study makes an attempt to show how the ecological model of language learning can provide a theoretical lens through which to explore teachers' practices of CALL that aim to encourage learner agency. The analysis centers on three focused extracts that illustrate interaction between and among the affordance of technology, the teacher participant's pedagogical considerations, and her goal of encouraging learner agency. The result of the study emphasizes the teacher's role from an ecological perspective and classroom learner agency mediated by technology, which provides useful insight that can contribute to language teaching practice with technology in the classroom.",

This qualitative meta-synthesis therefore aimed to investigate the research papers that were published between 2010 and 2015 in respect to language and intercultural learning within telecollaborative environments. Besides reporting emerging research trends among the studies, this synthesis study scrutinized recent emerging issues and observable patterns under five main themes: (1) the participants' overall views on their telecollaborative experiences, (2) language learning through telecollaboration, (3) intercultural learning through telecollaboration, (4) the challenges experienced within the telecollaborative projects, and (5) the needs for further effective telecollaboration. Finally, this study synthesizes key emerging issues in telecollaborative projects and offers further research and practice directions in line with the current observable patterns.",

Thus, understanding learners' perceptions and preferred use of mobile devices for learning are critical to realizing the educational potentials of mobile learning. This study explored language learners' self-directed use of mobile devices beyond the classroom through a survey and interview study with foreign language learners at a university in Hong Kong. A total of 256 learners were surveyed and 18 were interviewed to understand the nature of mobile language learning experiences that these learners engaged in autonomously beyond the classroom. Exploratory factor analysis yielded three dimensions of self-directed out-of-class mobile learning experience. Among the three dimensions, learners were found to use mobile devices more for facilitating the personalization of learning than for enhancing the authenticity and social connection in learning. This study further revealed that selective use was an outcome of the interaction between learner-defined affordances of the devices, their culturally informed and habitual use of the devices, their perceptions of the nature of the learning tasks, and the tempo-spatial circumstances of task implementation. The findings suggest that these factors need to be considered when designing mobile learning activities and educational interventions that promote mobile learning beyond the classroom.",

The research questions focused on how each look-up condition impacted the recall and recognition of word forms, word meanings, and passage comprehension. The participants were 84 first-year Japanese medical university students. The recall and recognition of word forms and word meanings, and passage comprehension data were analysed using the Rasch model. Probabilities of p&lt;0.05 were considered measurably different for the sample population used in this study, and probabilities of p&lt;0.003 were considered statistically significant and generalizable to a larger population. Overall, the results suggest three findings with regard to the on-line dictionary study. First, if only the results that were statistically significant are considered, there might be two conditions to learn words and comprehend reading passages: the spell condition seems to be best for learning the forms and meanings of words, and the control condition for promoting passage comprehension. Second, if the results that were both statistically significant and measurably different are considered, the spell, click, and control conditions might promote the learning of word forms, word meanings, and passage comprehension, respectively. Third, however, the click condition might promote both the learning of word meanings and passage comprehension because its effects were measurably higher to the spell condition on these measures. The results are consistent with the type of processing-resource allocation model for learning the forms and meanings of words and cognitive load theory for comprehending reading passages.",

    "author": "Lin, Huifen, Chen, Tsuiping, Lious, Hsien-Chin",
    "description": "Since its introduction by Glass in the 1970s, meta-analysis has become a widely accepted and the most preferred approach to conducting research synthesis. Overcoming the weaknesses commonly associated with traditional narrative review and vote counting, meta-analysis is a statistical method of systematically aggregating and analyzing empirical studies by following well-established procedures. The findings of a meta-analysis, when appropriately conducted, are able to inform important policy decisions and provide practical pedagogical suggestions. With the growing number of publications employing meta-analysis across a wide variety of disciplines, it has received criticism due to its inconsistent findings derived from multiple meta-analyses in the same research domain. These inconsistencies have arisen partly due to the alternatives available to meta-analysts in each major meta-analytic procedure. Researchers have therefore recommended transparent reporting on the decision-making for every essential judgment call so that the results across multiple meta-analyses become replicable, consistent, and interpretable. This research explored the degree to which meta-analyses in the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) discipline transparently reported their decisions in every critical step. To achieve this aim, we retrieved 15 eligible meta-analyses in CALL published between 2003 and 2015. Features of these meta-analyses were extracted based on a codebook modified from Cooper (2003) and Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou and Kern (2012). A transparency score of reporting was then calculated to examine the degree to which these meta-analyses are compliant with the norms of reporting as recommended in the literature. We then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies and provide suggestions for conducting quality meta-analyses in this domain.",

    "description": "Combined with the ubiquity and constant connectivity of mobile devices, and with innovative approaches such as Data-Driven Learning (DDL), Natural Language Processing Technologies (NLPTs) as Open Educational Resources (OERs) could become a powerful tool for language learning as they promote individual and personalized learning. Using a questionnaire that was answered by language teachers (n = 230) in Spain and the UK, this research explores the extent to which OER NLPTs are currently known and used in adult foreign language learning. Our results suggest that teachers' familiarity and use of OER NLPTs are very low. Although online dictionaries, collocation dictionaries and spell checkers are widely known, NLPTs appear to be generally underused in foreign language teaching. It was found that teachers prefer computer-based environments over mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and that teachers' qualification determines their familiarity with a wider range of OER NLPTs. This research offers insight into future applications of Language Processing Technologies as OERs in language learning.",

    "description": "Flipped instruction has become a hot issue in foreign language teaching technology. In this study, we tracked learners in a beginner-level Chinese Foreign Language classroom to see if flipped teaching based on a MOOC made a difference to their oral proficiency development and rate of progress compared to a baseline group. Language development was assessed by standard complexity, accuracy and fluency measures, alongside subjective ratings. Learners' investment of time and perceptions of the new method were also investigated. Results showed that learners exposed to flipped instruction significantly (p &lt; 0.01) outperformed the baseline group in oral proficiency in many measures, especially in speech fluency, though their advantage in complexity and accuracy was less evident. Rate of progress through the syllabus for the flipped group was also faster, requiring 25% less face-to-face time. Learners in the flipped group also demonstrated more (out of class) time investment in their learning and more positive attitudes toward the course, though these two factors did not significantly associate with the proficiency measures. These results support the implementation of flipped instruction in foreign language classrooms for both better and faster learner improvement; we explore how far psycho-social models of active learning might explain its methodological advantages.",

    "description": "Over the years, educational institutions have increasingly integrated Web 2.0 platforms as support tools in the foreign language learning curriculum to facilitate learners' engagement with the foreign language, increase motivation, and enable them to socially and collaboratively interact with fellow learners online. While descriptive studies on the topic have long dominated the field, they often lack close examinations of the nature of peer interaction, its mediating factors, and the effect it has on participants' learning curve. Presenting a research project in which two groups of more than 200 first-year foreign language majors were introduced to collaborative writing through Facebook, this study demonstrates how and why online peer interaction occurs and unfolds. It is shown that learners engage in cognitive and metacognitive processes while being social and responsible participants in the learning process. These findings are compiled in a taxonomy, modelling the communicative functions of peer interaction for academic purposes in the Facebook environment. This study illustrates how first-year English majors use language to establish themselves as learners in a new learning environment while discussing academic writing challenges online. In the peer interaction process, learners initiate cardinal learning activities in which they strive for proper cognitive, metacognitive, organisational and social functioning.",

    "description": "This mixed-methods study investigates language learners' intention to attend a class and learn a foreign language in face-to-face and online settings using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB). The data were collected using interviews, questionnaires, and treatments with participants in two groups: a face-to-face language learning (FLL) group (n = 690) and an online language learning (OLL) group (n = 296). The results show that language learners' intentions are shaped by their attitudes toward the language-learning environment, the beliefs of people around them, and their beliefs about their abilities to perform in the language-learning environment. Understanding these three factors can help predict students' intentions to engage or not engage in learning a foreign language in online and face-to-face settings. Comparison of the results from both groups suggests that language learners prefer FLL classes to OLL classes. The use of the mixed-methods design helps to investigate language learners' beliefs. Employing Ajzen's TPB also confirms the need to employ different theoretical models when examining language learners' motivation to learn a language.",

Special attention is given to how each theme's findings can be applied to telecollaborative projects for Chinese language learners. Based on the model of competencies for telecollaborative teachers developed by O'Dowd (2013), the implications of twenty years of telecollaborative practice for teaching Chinese as a foreign language are discussed in four areas, i.e. organizational, pedagogical, digital competences, and attitudes and beliefs.",

    "description": "Being able to communicate in foreign languages, along with the remaining key competences for lifelong learning, are of special significance for upper-secondary school students -- soon-to-be tertiary education students and employees. Although Polish educational authorities have made efforts to account for this need in the Core Curriculum for Modern Languages, the provisions are pursued with difficulty in school practice. The aim of this paper is to address this challenge by exploring and evaluating the feasibility and student-participant perceptions of urban gaming in school settings as a didactic tool that facilitates language education, as well as digital, social, and learning to learn skills development in an upper-secondary school. Accordingly, the paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a technology assisted urban game named 'As it once was in Cracow--discovering the history of the city', developed for a group of Polish upper-secondary school students (N = 25) from Warsaw. The results provide evidence for student-perceived educational gains with regard to the development of skills such as teamwork, digital literacy, the English language, and content (history) knowledge.",

    "description": "Language education has a rich history of research and scholarship focusing on the effectiveness of learning activities and the impact these have on student behaviour and outcomes. One of the basic assumptions in foreign language pedagogy and CALL in particular is that learners want to be able to communicate effectively with native speakers of their chosen language. Combining principles of learning analytics and Big Data with learning design, this study used a student activity based taxonomy adopted by the Open University UK to inform module design. The learning designs of four introductory and intermediary language education modules and online engagement of 2111 learners were contrasted using weekly learning design data. In this study, we aimed to explore how learning design decisions made by language teachers influenced students' engagement in the VLE. Using fixed effect models, our findings indicated that 55% of variance of weekly online engagement in these four modules was explained by the way language teachers designed weekly learning design activities. Our learning analytics study highlights the potential affordances for CALL researchers to use the power of learning design and big data to explore and understand the complexities and dynamics of language learning for students and teachers.",

Understanding the nature of out-of-class language learning with technology is the initial step towards safeguarding its quality. This study examined the types of learning experiences that language learners engaged in outside the classroom and the influencing factors. Three distinct types of technological experiences, with different incentives and different emotional and behavioral manifestations, were identified based on the interview responses of 21 university foreign language learners. Structural equation modeling analysis of 439 survey responses indicated that the three types of technological experiences were influenced differently by various attitudinal and support factors. Instruction-oriented technological experiences were influenced the most by learners' perception of the usefulness of the technological experience for language learning, and entertainment- and information-oriented technological experiences were the only technological experiences that were influenced directly by perceived ease of the technological experience for language learning. Social-oriented technological experiences were influenced by myriad factors. Furthermore, it was found that the influencing factors for these experiences varied for learners with beginning and with intermediate proficiency levels. The findings underscore the importance of adopting differentiated approaches to supporting different types of technological experiences.",

The study adopted a 2 (+/- Test Announcement) x 4 (Type of Captioning) between-subject design, resulting in 8 experimental groups. 227 Dutch-speaking university students watched three French (= L2) videos in one of eight conditions. Results revealed that students in the glossed keyword captions group (with access to meaning) scored best on the form recognition and meaning recall tests. Analyses of the look-up behaviour of students in the glossed keyword captioning group revealed that looking up a given word was positively related to the learning of that word. Test Announcement did not affect word learning or look-up behaviour. Participants' vocabulary size was directly related to their learning gains as well as to their look-up behaviour in the glossed keyword condition.",

In previous studies, the learners were not obliged by design to notice the unfamiliar words and static approaches to assessment were adopted. In this quasi-experimental study, we adopted dynamic assessment (DA) approach and took measures to ensure noticing of the new words. Through purposive sampling, 80 intermediate English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students were selected as participants. They were randomly assigned to computerized dynamic assessment (CDA) and static assessment (SA) groups. Participants read five texts, one per week, and inferred the meaning of highlighted unfamiliar words. In CDA group, through a software program, struggling learners received graduated mediational hints for each target word which helped them to infer the meaning of unfamiliar words. No mediational assistance was provided to the participants of SA group. Acquisition and retention post-tests were administered to both groups one day and four weeks after reading each text, respectively. Results showed that vocabulary gains in CDA group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The findings suggest that the noticing of unfamiliar words and the adoption of DA approach could enhance vocabulary gains from lexical inferencing.",

A six-factor solution, comprising PCK, TK, CK, Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK), emerged from the EFA and was subsequently confirmed through CFA. The results provide support for approaches to English language teacher education which attempt to integrate TK, PK, and CK, rather than introduce them separately, and which highlight the ways in which emerging and established technologies can be employed to represent language and provide opportunities for communication that are known to promote language acquisition.",

Little research exists examining how students transition between online and on-campus language courses and what effect this has on students' academic success. We analyzed student data from language courses with online and on-campus counterparts, to better understand the extent to which online learning enables students to meet their intended learning outcomes. Our goals were to establish how the medium of learning (online vs. classroom) impacts students' academic success, to identify patterns in the students' transitioning between online and on-campus courses, and to gather evidence-based information about students' course choices and their decisions about online vs. on-campus. In addition to the comprehensive statistical analysis of learner data, we conducted a qualitative analysis of language biography surveys and semi-structured interviews with students currently enrolled in the German program. While the statistical data provided a birds-eye view of student trajectories over 10\u00a0years, the surveys and interviews gave us in-depth information about individual learning trajectories and students' curricular decisions.",

A total of 1,310 language errors were detected by the researcher. It was found that approximately 21% of these errors were spelling errors. A further 58% were characterised as either two-word phrases (45%), three-word phrases (9%), or four- and five-word phrases (4%) which are either absent from or rare in a large corpus of English which is known to be correct. The nature of software which can detect such words and phrases and bring them to students' attention with a view to self-correction is briefly described. Of the remaining 21% of errors not detected by such software, most were found to be either errors of tense (7%), misuse of false friends (4%) or problems with determiners (3%). Again, software which can help students detect and correct such errors is outlined. The limitations and pedagogical significance of the research are then briefly discussed.",

The survey results showed that a majority of participants used English for a variety of activities at least once a day: over 50% used English to communicate with others and to access information daily, over 40% listened to, viewed or read material in English daily, and over 30% created or collected content in English daily. These activities were nearly evenly distributed between activities related to the participants' coursework and more informal activities.

    "description": "One of the goals of foreign language (FL) education is to produce intercultural speakers. Telecollaboration can act as a catalyst for promoting language skills development, intercultural communicative competence (ICC), and multiple literacies. The significance of multimodal communicative competence (MCC) on the success or failure of a telecollaborative project and its interdependence with intercultural communicative competence (ICC) have already been established. The very few systematic reviews on ICC and second language (L2) or FL learning do not take into account the different modalities through which learners interact and co-construct meaning and intercultural competence. Drawing on ecological linguistics (EL) and semiotics, the present review contributes to the field of applied linguistics by reviewing online intercultural exchanges (OIEs) and ICC development in relation to the modality used for each exchange that is reviewed. Features of the context of each study that was conducted in either a K-12 or a university setting were coded according to a coding scheme and analysed quantitatively using descriptive statistics. The findings of studies conducted in university contexts, were reviewed in-depth inductively in relation to the impact of Web 2.0 tools -- and especially multimodality\u00a0--\u00a0on learners' development of ICC. The exclusive focus on university contexts in the in-depth review stems from the frequency at which universities serve as contexts for OIEs, comprising in this case more than two-thirds of the reviewed studies. Analysis of the data suggests that multimodality in Web 2.0 tools and applications affects ICC development in multiple ways but more research on ICC and L2 and FL learners in multimodal environments needs to be conducted.",

    "description": "Contextualised mobile assisted language learning (MALL) has been known for its potential in language learning rooted in social constructivism theories. However, a consistent approach to constituents of contextualised MALL, in addition to a quantitative tool to evaluate it, is missing in reported case studies. The present research, drawing upon literature context definitions, presents a research framework for analysing, designing and evaluating contextualised MALL. Real world and real life context variables were analysed and the potential influence of the country (target and non-target) and the mobile activities language learning orientation (generic/dedicated) on contextualised MALL was suggested. Empirical data collected from 53 L2 Chinese students in Taiwan and Israel, encompassing 296 types of MALL activities performed by students, was used to develop the contextualised MALL model as well as an index for measuring real world and real life context learning. This measuring index was subsequently established in a combined top-down and bottom-up process, using pre-defined context literature augmented with students' stories. At the end of the research procedure a quantitatively operative evaluation tool was developed. Real world was measured by the amount of content activity in relation to the place, typical or non-typical objects of the place and typical situations at the place. Real life was measured by the degree to which other tools assisted in other core activities whose purpose was not learning. The paper presents the research framework, the developed model and index with examples illustrating their application. They are offered for the research and practice community to use.",

    "description": "The present study explored the impact of WebQuest-based classroom on EFL learners' critical thinking and academic writing skills by collecting and analysing the data through a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach. Two intact classes, each with ten EFL learners, attending an IELTS course at a language institute in Sanandaj, Iran, took part in the study. California Critical Thinking Skills Test form B was used to assess the participants' critical thinking skills, IELTS academic writing task 1 and task 2 were used to assess their academic writing skills, a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess their perceptions towards the impact ofy the WebQuest-based classroom on critical thinking and academic writing skills, and the researcher/instructor journals were used to contribute to the qualitative findings. One-way MANOVA and one-way MANCOVA were used to analyse the quantitative data. The results revealed that both the WebQuest-based and the face-to-face classrooms developed the learners' critical thinking and academic writing skills, while the former outperformed the latter both in post- and delayed post-tests (i.e. short and long term effects) and took fewer sessions to cover the required materials. In addition, thematic analysis, used to analyse the qualitative data, uncovered a number of themes which addressed the learners' positive perceptions towards the impact of the WebQuest-based classroom.",

    "author": "Tseng, Jun-Jie",
    "description": "Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) proposed by Mishra and Koehler is a theoretical construct of teacher knowledge that describes how teachers teach subject matter content using certain instructional methods with specific technology in particular contexts. This study aims to explore the interface between TPACK and SLA, intending to examine (a) how a Taiwanese English teacher enhanced L2 interaction and (b) how her students perceived such teaching. While data regarding the teacher's TPACK-SLA knowledge was collected through lesson plans, classroom observations, and interviews, data associated with students' perceptions was obtained through a questionnaire survey and focus-group interviews. The findings suggest that the teacher enhanced L2 interaction by(a) drawing students' attention to grammatical patterns through annotated animations, (b) consolidating vocabulary use through image-based exercises and a bilingual concordancer, and (c) evaluating the use of sentence patterns through text-chatting with a chatbot. While the students could improve learner-computer interaction through obtaining enhanced input, they could also develop inter-personal communication competency through negotiating meaning. In addition, the students appreciated the ways their teacher taught English using &quot;Cool English.&quot; This study contributes some empirical insights into how EFL teachers can draw upon practices explored in instructed SLA to develop TPACK.",

    "description": "The need for the education system to teach twenty-first century skills produces an emphasis on the teaching of first language (L1) writing on the assimilation into the teaching process of information and communications technology (ICT) tools that promote writing. The purposes of this study are to examine general aspects of the integration of ICT tools into teaching-learning-evaluation processes and the unique aspects of ICT tools relevant to teaching L1 writing. A research questionnaire was developed to examine the disciplinary aspect of teaching L1 writing alongside general aspects of integrating ICT into teaching. The research tool tested on 391 L1 secondary school teachers. The findings show that e teachers perceive themselves as having achieved some mastery of the ICT tools examined and that they agree with positive statements about the value of using ICT tools in L1 teaching. Although they sometimes-to-often use ICT tools to assess their students' writing, they make limited use of them to teach L1 writing. We suggest that there may be a disciplinary barrier to ICT tool use in teaching in the form of a lack of teacher appreciation that ICT tools can greatly promote the teaching of L1 writing.",

L2 learning occurs only when the semiotic resources in the environment resonate with the learner's capacities such as their abilities, aptitudes, and attitudes. Adopting affordance as a theoretical and analytic construct, this study investigates using qualitative research methods what language development affordances WeChat, one of the most popular Social Networking Systems in Chinese-speaking communities, provided to two university-level Chinese language learners while they were studying abroad in an intensive language program in Shanghai. Four affordances were identified. The results also show that each affordance was manifested differently with each language learner due to unique communication norms on WeChat, each language learner's Chinese language proficiency, and their personal preference in WeChat communication. Pedagogical implications are also provided to guide educators and L2 users as to how to take advantage of WeChat for language learning.",

    "description": "This study investigates how university students taking fully online language-learning configure their learning environments to enhance opportunities for learning and meet broader academic and social-emotional needs. The study adopts a view of learning as both physically and socially situated, acknowledging that the physical (material, digital and hybrid) resources available in each student's learning environment, as well as the opportunities they have to interact with other people, can play very significant roles in shaping learning activities and outcomes. The paper focuses on how students reconfigure the learning environments designed/provided for them by their teachers and the university. Through interviews with 26 students, a mixture of deliberate, creative and spontaneous actions they took were revealed. Students not only reconfigured the physical environments in which their learning activities were situated, but also the tasks they were set and ways of working with other people. There has been a growing interest in student contributions in task, task engagement and processes in CALL research. This paper extends this research into the physical and social domains, with a focus on students' contributions to 'place-making'. It argues that design for CALL is best seen as a process in which learning situations are co-configured by teacher-designers and students.",

In this study, the treatment group's Spanish language instruction was through the use of &quot;Duolingo&quot;\u00ae, a computer and mobile app that uses gamification and adaptive learning technology to teach foreign languages. Students in the control group received their regularly scheduled English L1/Spanish L2 class learning activities. The study was 12 weeks in duration. Students were assessed with a 50-question, multiple-choice English to Spanish and Spanish to English pretest covering vocabulary and grammar to control for prior Spanish language achievement. Students were assessed with the Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales' (PALS) Academic Efficacy subscale to control for prior academic self-efficacy. The same two instruments were used as posttests. An analysis of covariance showed no significant difference in students' Spanish achievement or in academic self-efficacy between students who used &quot;Duolingo&quot;\u00ae and students who were taught with traditional face-to-face instruction. This demonstrates that &quot;Duolingo&quot;\u00ae is a useful tool for teaching Spanish to elementary students.",

    "description": "Learning analytics (LA) has emerged as a field that offers promising new ways to prevent drop-out and aid retention. However, other research suggests that large datasets of learner activity can be used to understand online learning behaviour and improve pedagogy. While the use of LA in language learning has received little attention to date, available research suggests that LA could provide valuable insights into task design for instructors and materials designers, as well as help students with effective learning strategies and personalised learning pathways. This paper first discusses previous CALL research based on learner tracking and specific affordances of LA for CALL, as well as its inherent limitations and challenges. The second part of the paper analyses data arising from the VITAL project that implemented LA in different blended or distance learning settings. Statistical and process-mining techniques were applied to data from 285 undergraduate students on a Business French course. Results suggested that most students planned their self-study sessions in accordance with the flipped classroom design. Other metrics measuring active online engagement\u00a0indicated significant differences between successful and non-successful students' learner patterns. The research implied that valuable insights can be acquired through LA and the use of visualisation and process-mining tools.",

    "author": "Yang, Yu-Fen",
    "description": "This study reports on how students construct new language knowledge by indirect feedback in web-based collaborative writing. Indirect feedback (text organization, reader-based perspectives, and clarity of purpose) encourages students to negotiate meaning instead of merely copying peers' direct feedback on grammatical corrections. According to the pre-test, 54 students were divided into the more- and less-proficient groups with 27 students in each group. The pre- and post-tests, students' log files recorded in the system, and an open-ended questionnaire were used in this study. The results indicate that the more-proficient students were able to provide indirect feedback to elaborate their thoughts. They further made decisions on accepting or rejecting their peers' or the teacher's suggestions while they integrated previous knowledge with new information they had learned from their peers and the teacher, which lead to new ideas generated in the final drafts. In contrast, the less-proficient students had predominantly copied their peers' direct feedback and corrected grammatical errors as they were not capable of producing indirect feedback. After engaging in more learning with the help from the more-proficient peers, the less-proficient students made more writing progress with indirect feedback than the more-proficient students. Through indirect feedback to construct new language knowledge, web-based collaborative writing fostered the more- and less-proficient students to learn from each other by negotiating meaning for text improvement.",

    "description": "Many types of L2 phonological perception are often difficult to acquire without instruction. These difficulties with perception may also be related to intelligibility in production. Instruction on perception contrasts is more likely to be successful with the use of phonetically variable input made available through computer-assisted pronunciation training. However, few computer-assisted programs have demonstrated flexibility in diagnosing and treating individual learner problems or have made effective use of linguistic resources such as corpora for creating training materials. This study introduces a system for segmental perceptual training that uses a computational approach to perception utilizing corpus based word frequency lists, high variability phonetic input, and text-to-speech technology to automatically create discrimination and identification perception exercises customized for individual learners. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in an experiment with pre- and post-test design, involving 32 adult Russian-speaking learners of English as a foreign language. The participants' perceptual gains were found to transfer to novel voices, but not to untrained words. Potential factors underlying the absence of word-level transfer are discussed. The results of the training model provide an example for replication in language teaching and research settings.",

There were some indications that different types of vocabulary knowledge were gained from the two types of media. The written blog entries promoted greater gains in orthographic knowledge than the videos. There was also tentative evidence that the videos promoted greater recall of the target words' grammatical functions and greater recognition and recall of their meanings.",

In Pakistan, unimpaired people face a lot of problems to communicate with deaf people due to the lack of SL understanding, learning resources, and interpreters. This problem is faced by the teachers who communicate with deaf students in the classrooms. The communication gap is filled with the development of a translation tool as Haseeb and Illyas concluded in their study that using this kind of tool, deaf people will have more opportunities to communicate with other members of society at every level. Different components of technology such as Python programming language, Natural Language Tool Kit, prerecorded PSL videos, Linux-based server, and databases are used to develop the prototype of PSL translation tool. This study provides a literature review to highlight the existing technological work done around the world and in Pakistan and also provides an architectural framework of the PSL translation tool which is developed by the researchers to facilitate the people who face difficulty to communicate with deaf people.",

Despite its apparent usefulness, whether the use of the LMS can indeed help learners learn more effectively remains an interesting matter for course providers, LMS vendors, and learners. Therefore, this study adopted the updated DeLone and McLean information system success model to examine whether LMS system quality, information quality, and service quality affect learners' system use and user satisfaction, and ultimately their learning effectiveness. Through a questionnaire survey, responses collected from 123 university students who studied in a blended learning environment at a university were analyzed. Findings showed that system quality and service quality, but not information quality, had a significant relationship with system use. In turn, system use had a significant relationship with learning effectiveness.",

In particular, it helps for team building and brainstorming on solutions of complex problems. While an effective group organization is critical for the success of such collaborative learning, many instructors would make arbitrary decisions about student grouping. This is mainly due to the lack of in-depth studies analyzing group setup in face-to-face settings and providing recommendations and practical guidelines for group assignment and management. To address this problem, we conducted a series of experiments exploring the dynamic formation of collaborative groups among foreign language students at different proficiency levels. On the basis of the obtained results and the identified limitations of the current methods, we propose a novel technology-enhanced approach to optimized group setup and effective management. This approach provides a scaffold for integrating Tangible Technology Enhanced Learning and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning into an instructional system with advanced interaction capabilities for augmented learning and enhanced instructor support for dynamic group management.",

    "description": "Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach that with the help of technology moves the traditional lecture from a group space to individual space, and the group space is used to create an interactive learning environment. Students view video lectures at home before the class, and the time during the class is used to engage students in peer-to-peer learning. This study evaluates the effectiveness of flipped approach by examining the relationship between flipped approach and student engagement at physical, behavioral, and emotional levels. The research uses a mixed method approach; it starts with collection and analysis of quantitative data, and then, the qualitative data are collected to compare and contrast the results of quantitative data. The results indicate that flipped approach improves physical and cognitive engagement of students. However, flipped approach does not improve their emotional engagement.",

While digital devices can certainly support learning, what about when they are a distraction? This study explored this 21st-century phenomenon from two perspectives: Does the use of a device for nonacademic purposes during a learning activity interfere with learning? Does the classroom policy about digital device use play a role? A total of 351 college students from 20 classes participated in this study. Short-term retention was checked: A video on educationally relevant material was shown followed by a brief quiz on that material. The results are informative for both factors--multitasking and policy effectiveness.",

This study investigated, through two parallel case studies, the interactive whiteboard potential in view of optimizing the exploitation of the interactive whiteboard, improving conceptual understanding, and fostering interactivity in secondary mathematics classrooms. Two main patterns for a productive interactive whiteboard use emerged: (a) a &quot;problem-solving&quot; pattern consisting of interactive whiteboard supporting problem-solving activities and (b) an &quot;organizer&quot; pattern consisting of using interactive whiteboard as a kind of advanced organizer and stimulating students' reflection and mathematical contributions. The two patterns were used to design and teach lessons that were analyzed through the instrumental orchestration framework elaborated by Drijvers, Tacoma, Besamusca, Doorman, and Boon. Analysis showed how the interactive whiteboard acted as a useful instrument for students' discussion and collective construction of mathematical knowledge.",

The development and validation of the instrument underwent an extended test design process. The first phase was the development of an item pool which made use of relevant literature and focus group interviews with EFL learners (n = 15). The second phase was the field-testing of the measure through its administration to 77 EFL learners. The last phase involved an evaluation of the psychometric properties of the revised instrument given to a total of 250 EFL learners. The findings from Confirmatory Factor Analysis with acceptable values of goodness of fit indices (NFI = 0.89; CFI = 0.93; TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.06 and SRMR = 0.04) supported a 23-item, five-factor scale. The Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient of the overall scale was calculated to be 0.85, leading to the conclusion that the scale proposed here is a valid and reliable measure for systematic inquiry into EFL learners' self-regulated vocabulary learning through technology.",

    "description": "The affordances associated with networked multilingualism (Androutsopoulos, 2015) have led social media scholars to replace traditional notions of code-switching with broader concepts such as translingual practices. In an attempt to further our understanding of online multilingual linguistic practices in the context of educational telecollaboration, we examined a series of interactions taken from a larger online ethnography of a global community of English as a foreign language (EFL) educators. We describe and illustrate how, when, and why participants drew on their multilingual repertoires within a Facebook group, created by two EFL teachers for their students and where English served as the primary shared linguistic resource. Taking a computer-mediated discourse analytic approach to analyzing data that included a total of 1,206 posts and comments on the group's Facebook page, ethnographic interviews with the teachers, and online documents from their telecollaboration, we found that although this group was discursively constructed as an English-only zone by the teachers for their students to practice English, all participants--especially the teachers--eventually broke this rule, as they drew on both Spanish and Arabic for a variety of purposes, such as selecting an addressee, establishing solidarity, and modeling intercultural sensitivity.",

This article investigates participation, interaction patterns, and social presence (SP) levels of pre-service English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in online communication within a longitudinal blended learning setting. A secondary aim of this article is to explore social network analysis (SNA) as an alternative method to measure SP. Data analysis included calculation of number of forum entries and words, qualitative analysis of interaction patterns, content analysis, and SNA. The results indicated that an online course on tutoring skills and SP improved pre-service EFL teachers' online participation skills. Increased interaction and a more cohesive network were observed as the course progressed. The findings are significant in that they suggest a relationship between content analysis for SP (especially the interactive dimension) and SNA measures (centrality, influence, and prestige), implicating SNA as an emerging research method for the investigation of SP.

However, most of the research indicates that there is need for more detailed understanding of the pedagogical processes that support technology-enhanced language learning. This text takes a social semiotic perspective to examine multimodal interaction (Jewitt, Bezemer, &amp; O'Halloran, 2016) of learners taking part in telecollaborative activities in a language classroom. The study aims to provide a detailed view of the ways in which the language teachers' task-as-workplan (Breen, 1987, 1989), designed around different technologies, dovetails (or not) into the task-as-process (i.e., the way in which the learners interpret and act upon the task instructions). Comparing the teachers' pedagogical design and intended purpose of different technology-supported tasks with the actual way in which the learners interact with the tools, the results show that the students often engage with the technology in unexpected, and at times, highly innovative ways that often diverge from the task-as-workplan.",

To address this gap in research and practice, the current study proposes and evaluates a learning support framework for mastery-based learning outside class that aims to respond to students' cognitive and affective needs and needs for developing appropriate learning strategies. The proposed framework was evaluated in a Chinese language course offered at an Australian university in Semester 1, 2016. This study focuses on the qualitative data collected through courses, such as screen captures of various learning support mechanisms, a student survey, and reflective journals from teachers.

As language itself is recognized as a multimodal resource for communicative purposes, different forms of multimodality have been advocated to nurture students' multiliteracies in educational contexts. This study aims to investigate students' perceived benefits with respect to the process of their multimodal video making. The participants were 69 advanced English as a foreign language undergraduate students who took a course titled Multimedia English for one-semester (18 weeks) at a university in Taiwan. The students were trained to utilize a wide range of multimedia affordances to facilitate their English learning. They were asked to produce a digital video employing multiple modalities for their final project. The collected data for the scope of the paper included students' uploaded reflective essays and videos of their final oral presentations with their PowerPoint slides based upon their overall perceptions regarding their video creation processes and the perceived benefits they experienced. The findings showed that a multitude of students perceived that the video making process nurtured their multiliteracies to different degrees and expanded their awareness of the interplay between different modes of semiotic resources for meaning construction. This study also highlights pedagogical implications for language teachers regarding the provision of opportunities for students to become involved in the creation of multimodal artifacts in developing their multiliteracies.",

Addressing the assessment task through a linguistically-grounded investigation of telecollaborative chats, this exploratory study aims to demonstrate how abstract aspects of ICC can be operationalized as deployment of particular discourse structuring and linguistic resources. Drawing on the systemic functional approach to discourse analysis (Eggins &amp; Slade, 1997) and Byram's (1997) framework of ICC, this study examines written synchronous chats created throughout a 7-week telecollaborative activity by advanced American learners of German at a private US University and by German University students, future FL teachers. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate what precise discursive moves and language resources that realize them characterize ICC and at the same time enable it. Implications of the use of the methodological framework for further research of ICC in telecollaborative discourse, as well as some applications of the findings to pedagogy, conclude the study.",

It remains unclear how these factors influence different students' ability to use AWCF, partly because classroom research to date has been based on within-group designs and writing tasks in which students can choose other ways to respond to feedback besides correction. To investigate these issues, the present study used an AWCF-based error-correction task in which student response type was controlled, as were the explicitness and accuracy of the feedback. Eighty-two ESL students in two, sequenced developmental writing courses participated. Generic feedback was found to result in fewer successful error corrections than specific feedback as well as higher perceptions of mental-effort expenditure and lower ratings of clarity and helpfulness. Course level was found not to be a significant factor in most analyses. Implications for L2 classroom applications of AWCF as well as the design of AWCF tools are discussed.",

    "description": "Data mining is increasing its popularity in the research of Technology-Enhanced Language Learning and Applied Linguistics in general. It enables a better understanding of progress, performance and possible pitfalls, which would be useful for language learners, teachers and researchers. Until recently it was an unexplored field, but it is expected to grow exponentially in the following years. This article attempts to be a relevant contribution as an instance of empirical research, showing the application of Learning Analytics to the Language MOOC (LMOOC) 'How to succeed in the English B1 Level Exam.' The focus or the research was threefold, trying to find out: (1) what types of learning objects students engage with most, (2) what aspects of online interaction relate more strongly to course completion and success, and (3) which are the most prominent student profiles in an LMOOC. Results show that short video-pills are the most powerful learning objects in this type of online courses, the regular submission of automated grading activities is a robust indicator towards course success, and the most prominent student profile in LMOOCs is 'viewers', those who access the learning materials but do not submit tasks or engage in online interaction actively, which would explain why the completion rate in LMOOCs is so low. This novel perspective into students' language learning, which big data has assisted us in, should guide course creators to re-design the LMOOC for the enhancement of the audio-visual content. LMOOC instructors and facilitators should also encourage participants to increase the submission of activities--acknowledging these small achievements through micro-credentialing and badges-, and special attention ought to be paid to the most prominent LMOOC profile, those 'viewers' who should be lured into becoming 'solvers' or, even better, 'all-rounders'.",

    "title": "Viewing L2 Captioned Videos: What&apos;s in It for the Listener?",
    "author": "Yeldham, Michael",
    "description": "Captioning is commonly used to scaffold video viewing for second language learners, with the captioning affording the learners access to authentic videos that would ordinarily be out of their reach. Ostensibly the videos are mainly shown to help improve the learners' listening abilities. However, there is the view that the learners largely tend to just read the captions at the expense of listening to the speakers, thus doing little more than improving their reading skills. Consequently, this article examines a number of past studies to investigate whether this is the case or whether the learners' listening may indeed benefit. A key approach to this investigation of the past research is to ascertain how the learners process the videos; there is obviously the need for the learners to listen, to some degree, for their listening abilities to develop. The investigation finds that less-proficient learners tend more to read texts than listen to them, while more-proficient learners generally utilize a wider range of cues (caption, speaker and visual), although various factors may mediate these trends. Based on these findings, pedagogical suggestions are made for classroom teachers' use of captioned videos, along with suggestions for the future research of captioned viewing.",

    "description": "To address the problem of limited opportunities for practicing second language speaking in interaction, especially delicate interactions requiring pragmatic competence, we describe computer simulations designed for the oral practice of extended pragmatic routines and report on the affordances of such simulations for learning pragmatically appropriate communication. Twelve highly proficient learners of English completed six simulated conversations focused on making requests in academic contexts. Evidence of learning was examined microgenetically by comparing data across the simulated conversations and triangulated by written reflections, surveys, and interviews. Results showed that participants gained content and linguistic forms from expert speaker models, and their interactions in scenario-based simulations indicated greater pragmatic awareness and changes in oral production over time. The majority of participants viewed the program positively, commenting on features such as its authenticity and predictive accuracy.",

    "description": "Logged tracking data for online courses are generally not available to instructors, students, and course designers and developers, and even if these data were available, most content-oriented instructors do not have the skill set to analyze them. Learning analytics, mined from logged course data and usually presented in the form of learning dashboards, can inform instructors and students about how students are doing in a course, for example, questions answered correctly or incorrectly, pages visited, exercises completed, and assessment scores. However, these dashboards do not provide data on what students are doing when interacting with course materials. This dearth of information severely limits the amount of feedback that online course instructors can give to students on how to best maximize their time online to meet their learning outcomes. Using logged data from an online French course, the research presented here offers a sample of preliminary statistical visualizations created using data from students interacting with a course video and its attendant questions. By developing a methodology that can be applied to other similar datasets, these types of visualizations could be automatically generated for all stakeholders to obtain a fuller picture of how students behave in online courses.",

Research has pointed out the advantages of using iPads in classrooms to enhance teaching, engage learning, and promote learning outcomes. iPads have been proven to be a useful and powerful digital mobile device in language learning including speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a technology integrated twenty-first century writing workshop had an influence on the ability and attitude towards writing in Chinese for second graders enrolled in the Mandarin Chinese program in a language immersion elementary school. Twenty-four students participated in the study. Recording technology (iPad recording app), an iPad camera, and the Book Creator App were integrated into the twenty-first century writing workshop. A pre-survey, post-survey, and observation were used to collect data. The results of the study confirmed that writing barriers decreased when the Chinese immersion program students utilized iPads in the writing workshop. Also, the writing ability and attitudes of the Chinese immersion program students improved after the completion of their twenty-first century writing workshop.",

    "description": "Driven by interactionist theory and operationalized by task-based interaction, this study aims to investigate EFL learners' task-based negotiation in Second Life (SL), a 3D multi-user virtual environment (MUVE). A group of adult EFL learners with diverse cultural/linguistic backgrounds in L1 participated in this task-based virtual class. Learners used avatars to interact with peers in communication tasks via voice chat. Discourse samples were collected through their oral production to examine their language patterns during negotiated interaction. A framework of negotiation of meaning was employed to code and analyze the transcribed data. Two types of negotiation routine were identified: single-layered trigger-resolution sequence and multi-layered trigger-resolution sequence. Specifically, the interrelationship among task types, negotiation and strategy use was also established in the study: jigsaw task prompted the most instances of negotiation and strategy use, followed by information-gap and decision-making tasks, whereas opinion-exchange task triggered the least. This study suggests that two-way directed tasks with convergent, obligatory, single-outcome conditions will stimulate more cognitive and linguistic processes of negotiation involving interactional modifications -- leading to more complex and lengthy negotiation routine. It is concluded that SL as a 3D MUVE is conducive to theoretically-driven, pedagogically-sound, task-based research in language acquisition.",

    "description": "Technology-mediated vocabulary development (TMVD) in a second language (L2) covers a wide range of instructional and learning treatments, contexts, and technologies and is situated in a broader field of second language vocabulary learning. Vocabulary knowledge is a complex, multidimensional construct that has been interpreted and categorized in second language research in many different ways. This review identifies methodological practices in research into L2 TMVD and provides a synthesis of learning and instructional approaches, aspects of vocabulary knowledge being investigated, and measures of vocabulary development used in this research. A sample of 82 primary studies from 2010 to 2017 was selected and coded for target methodological features. The results of the review show that TMVD research has achieved a certain degree of methodological maturity, while a number of issues have also been identified. These issues include: the practice of comparing technology-mediated instruction with &quot;traditional&quot; instruction without technology, insufficient reporting of participants' L2 proficiency, and a dearth of treatments targeting fluency development. The review also showed a preference for evaluating the knowledge of individual vocabulary items rather than the development of the L2 lexicon, and insufficient use of online and implicit measures of vocabulary knowledge. Recommendations for future TMVD research are provided.",

    "author": "Burtson, Jack, Arispe, Kelly",
    "description": "The goal of this meta-analysis is to evaluate how instructional technology has impacted advanced second language (AL2) development. Although numerous metaanalyses have been conducted within the CALL literature over the past two decades, they primarily focus upon learning outcomes and related effect sizes. None focus on advanced learning per se. Where AL2 is even mentioned, which is only rarely, little or no attention is paid to critical research parameters within the studies that are analyzed. Most notably, in summarizing learning outcomes, the linguistic competence of learners claimed to be at advanced level is simply taken at face value. So, too, no consideration is given to the difficulty level of tasks undertaken by students or their appropriateness to students' claimed proficiency. It is the intent of this general overview of the contribution of CALL to AL2 to address these issues through a comprehensive analysis of the publications in four prominent CALL journals (CALICO, CALL, Language Learning &amp; Technology, and ReCALL) over some 30 years. In so doing, the Performance Descriptors (PD) and NCSSFL-Can-Do Statements (CDS) of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) are adopted as external criteria for establishing student competence level, task difficulty, and appropriateness. This study concludes that not only are CALL AL2 studies extremely limited in number and focus, but also that they suffer from serious design flaws that call into question a great portion of the claims made regarding the contribution of instructional technology to the furthering of advanced-level foreign language competence.",

In this mixed-methods study, survey and interview data with Intensive English Program (IEP) administrators in the United States show that less formal training and experience in online education are correlated with lower perceived self-efficacy among IEP administrators faced with managing online programs, and that IEP administrators overwhelmingly believe additional training would be beneficial.

After two decades of research, it is an apt time to engage in a systematic review of previous studies in the form of a scoping review in order to illuminate the pedagogical practices commonly used in telecollaboration. The study synthesized 55 distinct telecollaboration projects that took place in university foreign-language classes and utilized synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) tools to answer (1) What are the typical arrangements of SCMC-based telecollaboration (e.g., participants, project set-ups, and interaction set-ups)? and (2) How have SCMC-based telecollaboration projects changed over the last two decades? We identified six commonly adopted arrangements of SCMC-based telecollaboration. We also found that, while certain pedagogical practices in telecollaboration have matured, the field is undergoing reconceptualization and expansion with the advancement of technology and diversification of participants. We conclude the article with suggestions regarding reporting practices in telecollaboration research, thereby enabling more rigorous synthesis in the future.",

Pragmatics is at the core of this interaction. The fields of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and the teaching and learning of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) have grown up together. These fields have sometimes been at odds, but, more often than not, they have drawn on synergies from one another to advance. Emerging digital tools have made notable innovations in the field of ILP development possible, and, simultaneously, the needs of ILP researchers and practitioners have led to technological innovation.

As opposed to most studies into the NS-NNS interface, we reversed the expert-learner participant roles: during the task performance, the NS was the (cultural) learner and the NNS the expert. Our aim was to observe the influence of these reversed participant categories on participant behavior and task performance, i.e., to see if NNS behavior as described in earlier studies also applies to the NSs in a similar apprentice position during a cross-cultural exchange, and vice versa. We found that, in both video calls and written chats, the NSs and NNSs behave in a similar manner when cast in both apprentice and learner roles. We conclude that, in task design and telecollaboration practice, the situated identities of the participants should be taken into account.",

In weeks 1 and 3, the students received English-only feedback (L2), and in weeks 2 and 4, the students also received feedback in their native language (L1). The data were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Because the L1 has been shown to be helpful in students' learning, it was hoped that the L1 glossed feedback in AWE would prove helpful as well. The participants felt a need for the glosses but also expressed reservations about relying on the L1. While the participants' revision behaviors sometimes differed, both showed a positive attitude toward the L1 glossed feedback, toward increased noticing of errors, and toward their autonomy while using AWE.",

    "description": "There is a growing demand for online course options, including classes offered and required in foreign languages. However, offering courses in multiple formats presents the challenges of developing high quality online courses and assessing the overall program effectiveness as students may elect to take the sequenced language acquisition courses in different formats. Thus, students complete the courses through various combinations of modes (i.e., all online, all face-to-face, some online/some F2F, transferring from another university or after successfully completing a placement exam). The purpose of this study was to examine a second language program offering both seated and online Spanish language acquisition classes at a small regional campus in the Midwest. Oral proficiency was tested using the Pearson Versant Test for Spanish and students' (n=108) scores were then compared to the ACTFL established benchmarks after one and two years of language study. In this study 42% met or exceeded the first year overall oral proficiency benchmark of Intermediate-Low and 27.5% met or exceeded the second year overall benchmark of Intermediate-Mid. These results suggest online Spanish course options can be an effective mode for students to meet oral proficiency benchmarks when programs require asynchronous and synchronous oral production, and provide speaking practice opportunities. However, additional research in this area is needed to better understand why some students are not meeting the benchmark.",

In this article, we share our experience of using Turnitin for peer review in an ESL academic writing course and discuss its advantages, its limitations, and how different features of PeerMark may be used to address some of the challenges identified in previous research on peer review in the L2 writing classroom. Throughout a semester, the students were required to complete three peer review tasks through Turnitin. Based on the instructor's experience and the students' reports, we found that Turnitin could help shift students' attention from local to global issues in writing, scaffold students in their effort to provide more helpful comments and to make connections between specific suggestions and holistic advice for writing, and facilitate classroom management during peer review.",

This study reports on a netnographic investigation (Kozinets, 2010) of an online community for learning Korean. Data collection took place over seven weeks and included observation of a Reddit forum, observation of a chatroom, and an open-ended questionnaire. Activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001) informed the analysis of the community learning activity. Contrary to what has been reported about language learning in many online communities, findings revealed relatively little target-language use and a great deal of learning about language. English was used 93% of the time on the forum, and 81% of the time in the chatroom. Other findings include highly-participatory interactional patterns for learning about linguistic forms, community rules designed to promote learning on a democratically organized web platform, and a stark division of community labor between language learners and language experts.",

Our findings indicate that many of the heritage language learners (HLLs) had complex multilingual backgrounds which affected both their sense of identity and their motivations for learning the heritage language. I will argue that a more dynamic model of HLA may provide a better understanding of how HLLs negotiate and construct their identities in a plurilingual world.",

    "description": "While vocabulary development is mostly peripheral to entertainment or socialization, there are opportunities for explicit learning which can complement incidental learning. In fact, recent work based on usage-based language theories calls for a combination of inductive learning and explicit instruction (Ortega, 2015; Tyler &amp; Ortega, 2018). A common denominator in current views and practices concerning vocabulary learning is the recognition of the centrality of context, whether that be in independent reading, watching, or listening in the L2; interacting with other L2 users online (social media, gaming, fanfiction, etc.); accessing sample expression use through corpora; using L2 material supplied with glosses or other comprehension and learning assistance; or encountering and learning new words through everyday conversations in the target language. Contextualized encounters are likely to enhance the chances of retention, as words and expressions are used in meaningful, and therefore more memorable, ways. In this column the author will look at different online contexts of language use that enable vocabulary expansion and enrichment.",

Many most commonly taught language (MCTL) learners learn a language for a variety of reasons including potential benefit to their career or because it is compulsory in school. In the case of LCTLs and ELs, there may be different motivating factors including cultural, heritage, and language preservation reasons (D\u00f6rnyei &amp; Schmidt, 2001). As the motivation and learning goals of LCTL and EL leaners are often different to those of MCTL learners, it is reasonable to use different evaluation approaches.

    "author": "Bikowski, Dawn, Casal, J. Elliott",
    "description": "This mixed-methods study explored non-native English speaking students' learning processes and engagement as they used a customized interactive digital textbook housed on a mobile device. Think aloud protocols, surveys of anticipated and actual engagement with the digital textbook, reflective journals, and member checking constituted data collection. Participants included 13 students in a large U.S. university Business English class. This study responds to the call for further research on how interacting with digital textbooks and mobile devices may affect student reading behaviors and the learning process, using the cultures-of-use conceptual framework by Thorne (2003) as a lens for analysis. Results of a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test found that participants entered the course with high expectations for the digital textbook and ratings remained high over the term, with only one area showing a significant decrease in engagement. Analysis of think aloud protocol and reflective journal data resulted in the creation of the Framework for Learning with Digital Resources. This framework of learning processes and strategies can be used by materials designers in creating digital textbooks and resources and by educators in supporting students as they move from using digital devices mainly for personal use to utilizing them effectively in their learning.",

    "title": "Pre-Task Planning in L2 Text-Chat: Examining Learners&apos; Process and Performance",
    "author": "Ziegler, Nicole",
    "description": "Research suggests that pre-task planning time provides learners with opportunities to formulate, organize, and mentally store content, thereby freeing up attentional resources during tasks (Skehan, Xiaoyue, Qian, &amp; Wang, 2012). However, relatively few studies to date have investigated pre-task planning in a synchronous computer-mediated communication setting (e.g., Lai, Fei, &amp; Roots, 2008; Hsu, 2012, 2015). In addition to a scarcity of computer-assisted language learning research, relatively little is known about what learners do when they plan or how they use their plans during tasks. The goals of the current study were twofold: (a) to examine the relationship between pre-task planning and learners' production and (b) to explore the affordances offered by computer-mediated contexts to further investigate how and what learners may (or may not) be planning during pre-task and within-task planning time. Results suggest that three minutes of planning time resulted in increases in lexical complexity (but not phrasal or syntactic), although no significant findings were identified for accuracy or fluency. In addition, findings indicate that technology offers researchers a number of unique methodological affordances, such as the ability to see what learners produce, regardless of whether they transmit this information to their interlocutor, thereby providing evidence of L2 knowledge that would otherwise be unobservable.",

    "description": "Framed from positioning theory and dynamic systems theory, the paper reports on a naturalistic study involving four Chinese participants and their American peers in an intercultural asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) activity. Based on the moment-by-moment analysis and triangulation of forum posts, reflective essays, and retrospective interviews, this study charts out participants' positioning trajectories and identifies five discursive practices (pronouns, epistemic phrases, evaluative phrases, emoticons, and posting style) as control parameters of participants' positioning systems. The study also reveals that positioning in ACMC is multiple, emergent, and contested, defying preconceived roles and identities. Therefore, the success of ACMC can be attributed to the participants' ability to make sense and make use of discursive practices to negotiate positions and achieve positioning alignment. The pedagogical implications of positioning interrogation and positioning intervention in ACMC are also discussed.",

Data were collected from two first-year Chinese classes (one in traditional and the other in flipped format) to investigate whether there were statistically significant differences in learning outcomes and students' levels of satisfaction between the two classes. Final exam and oral test scores showed that students in the flipped class performed better in speaking, since more time was devoted to meaningful interactions in class. As indicated in the results of the end-of-the-semester questionnaire, these students also gave higher average ratings on three aspects of their learning experience: level of required self-directedness, amount of practice in class, and stimulation of interest in the subject.",

    "description": "The importance of authentic communicative practices in foreign language (FL) learning has long been recognized. However, most FL learners lack adequate access to authentic communicative environments in the target language. In this article, we propose the use of telepresence robots as a potential solution to bridge this gap. Telepresence robots can be controlled by remote language learners online, enabling them to gain virtual access to authentic environments in the target language and to interact with native speakers in those environments in real time. In this exploratory study, three English learners and a native-speaker of American English participated in a campus tour activity using a telepresence robot. We examined the experience of our participants and the conversational features of their telepresence interactions through analyses of the interview data, field notes, and transcripts of conversations captured on video. Our findings show that telepresence robots have substantial potential for promoting FL learning by providing authentic communicative practice for remote language learners. The findings have useful implications for informing future research design.",

It also examined whether the application of digital game mechanics increased student online contribution and writing performance. Three classes of Secondary 4 students (16- to 17-year-olds) participated in the 7-week study. The first experimental group (n = 22) utilized the blended learning + gamification approach. The second experimental group (n = 30) utilized only the blended learning approach. In the control group (n = 20), a teacher-led direct-instruction approach on the components of argumentation was employed. Data sources included students' pre- and post-test written essays, students' online Edmodo postings, and student and teacher interviews. We found a significant improvement in students' writing using the blended learning approach. On-topic online contributions were significantly higher when gamification was adopted. Student and teacher opinions on the blended learning approach were also examined.",

    "author": "Balaman, Ufuk",
    "description": "Technology-mediated task settings are rich interactional domains in which second language (L2) learners manage a multitude of interactional resources for task accomplishment. The affordances of these settings have been repeatedly addressed in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) literature mainly based on theory-informed task design principles oriented to the elicitation of structured learning outcomes. However, such focus on design and outcome has left unexplored the great diversity of emergent interactional resources that learners deploy in situ. With this in mind, and using conversation analysis (CA) as the research methodology, this study sets out to describe the task engagement processes of L2 learners who collaboratively engage in online tasks. A close look into screen-recorded interactions of geographically dispersed participants shows that they orient to numerous context-specific interactional resources, which also locates a process-oriented interactional development site for further examination. To this end, the study presents a longitudinal conversation analytic treatment of a focal participant's context-specific interactional behaviors. The findings explicate the emergence and diversification of interactional resources, thus evidencing task-induced development of L2 interactional competence (IC). By providing participant-oriented, situated, qualitative insights into interactional development in and through online task-oriented L2 interactions, the study contributes to CALL, task design, and L2 IC based on methodological underpinnings of CA.",

    "description": "This study examined the role of corrective feedback in the context of an English as a second language (ESL) and French as a second language (FSL) eTandem chat exchange involving Grade 6 students. The students were enrolled in intensive programs in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario and had an elementary to low intermediate level of language proficiency. Tasks were completed on a weekly basis over a 9-week period. Six tasks completed by 13 pairs were retained for analysis. The analysis showed that the ESL and FSL students provided three types of feedback: explicit feedback, recasts, and negotiation of form. Unlike the study by Morris (2005), which involved Grade 5 second language (L2) Spanish students, the preference in this study was for explicit feedback. This difference was attributed to the tandem approach which emphasizes training in how to give feedback as well as school culture. Differences between the amount of feedback provided during the ESL and FSL exchanges were also observed. Here, too, the influence of school culture appears to have been a factor. The ESL students appeared to be more positively oriented to L2 learning, reflected in a higher appreciation of the tandem learning exchange. Implications for teaching and the need of future research are discussed.",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "This article provides an update to the author's overview of developments in second language (L2) online writing that he wrote in 2008. There has been renewed interest in L2 writing through the wide use of social media, along with the rising popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and telecollaboration (class-based online exchanges). The recognition of writing as a social act has also led to a significant rise in interest in collaborative writing. This has been aided by the popularity of tools providing a shared writing space, such as Google Docs. The importance and recognition of genre in both student work and writing theory have grown considerably among practitioners and researchers. The increased practice of integrating multimedia into writing is reflected in the popularity of multimodal projects, such as digital storytelling. At the same time, digital tools for evaluating writing have become more widely available in the form of digital annotators and automated writing evaluation (AWE) software, which take advantage of advances in corpus linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). In addition, tools for processing and evaluating large data sets enable approaches from data mining that provide valuable insights into writing processes. The variety and the complexity of online writing environments has increased the need for both learner and teacher training.

Intermediate Spanish learners participated in this study involving two jigsaw tasks based on two different picture stories. Participants were randomly placed in dyads and assigned to VidSCMC and AudSCMC groups. The dyads then performed a jigsaw task and a dictogloss task consecutively in a counterbalanced design. Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses were carried out to measure any possible significant differences in the number and nature of LREs by task and by group. The results revealed no difference in the number of LREs per task or CMC mode. However, significant differences were found in LRE foci per task. Finally, significant differences were also found in the number of unresolved LREs per mode. Results are discussed in relation to the pertinent literature.",

    "description": "Evidence is accumulating that a major shift is underway in the ways that second language (L2) development is taking place. Increasingly, especially among young people, that process is occurring outside of institutional settings, predominately through the use of online networks and media. That phenomenon has been particularly noticed for learners of English, as shown in recent studies of fully autonomous learners in Brazil (Cole &amp; Vanderplank, 2016) and predominantly recreational L2 users in Europe (Kusyk, 2017; Sundqvist &amp; Sylv\u00e9n, 2016). One of the hallmarks of this kind of language development is the great variety of approaches and materials used (i.e., social media, online participation in affinity spaces, watching videos, listening to music, engaging in online learning communities). The availability of immense quantities of spoken and written content in open (or inexpensively available) online channels, most also accessible on mobile devices, opens up countless opportunities for users to mix and match as never before tools, services, media, and group participation in ways that accommodate individual L2 needs and preferences. This article presents how informal language learning is taking place online.",

This study incorporated pair work with group discussion as interactional contexts, connecting Korean language learners with English language learners. Pair work included online chatting and personal blog writing where each pair exchanged feedback on one another's L2 writing. Group discussion included interaction among all the participants in a group blog where they discussed weekly topics. The study found that individual participants differently perceived the effectiveness of the two interactional contexts: some thought that both contexts were helpful together for developing L2 skills and for acquiring cultural knowledge, while others thought that these two contexts together were not as effective as expected. These perceptions affected not only the participant's own participation in the project, but also others' participation. This study offers pedagogical implications for ways in which researchers can further improve the design of eTandem learning.",

    "description": "Activities that promote fluency development or the automatization of speech are often ignored in second language classes because they do not teach new things; instead, they focus on speeding up language use (Nation &amp; Newton, 2008). Anxiety also decreases chances for fluency development, as learners are less willing to produce output (Gregersen &amp; MacIntyre, 2014), consequently hindering language development (Swain, 2000). One way of minimizing the impact of these limitations is to motivate students to speak intelligibly and fluently, preferably beyond the constraints of the language classroom. In this study, we investigated the pedagogical use of Spaceteam ESL, a mobile game that requires intelligible and fluent computer-mediated oral exchanges among players. Participants (N = 20) were low-intermediate English as a second language (ESL) students divided into two groups: the treatment group, which played Spaceteam ESL as a 15-minute warm-up activity for six weeks, and the control group, which engaged in comparable non-gaming activities. Pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests measured changes in oral fluency (i.e., syllables produced per minute and judges' ratings) and interviews addressed factors related to anxiety and willingness to communicate (WTC). Findings indicated that learners who played Spaceteam ESL outperformed the control group in judges' ratings for oral fluency and that the gameplay might positively influence anxiety and WTC.",

The results also reveal regular attrition patterns across all modes of delivery, with sharp drop-outs initially and concentrations of drop-outs at certain junctures in the courses. The drop-out patterns revealed in this study called for a re-evaluation of earlier parameters by which retention is measured, and especially what it means to &quot;complete a course.&quot; Instead of considering course completion in light of 100% coverage, the findings show considerably higher retention on &quot;IOL&quot; when the parameters for course completion are adjusted to for instance 90% coverage of course content.",

Data were collected through an online questionnaire with 30 items. The survey was distributed both in English and in Spanish. The results provide a profile of &quot;busuu&quot; app users, show patterns of use, and what app features learners find most valuable for language learning. Most users are at beginner level and learn for personal interest. They find the app has helped them improve their knowledge of the language they are learning, with vocabulary as the main area of improvement. The high expectations from users and the fact that a third of respondents use &quot;busuu&quot; as their only language learning source suggest that a large proportion of users consider apps a reliable tool for language learning.",

This meta-analysis of the experimental literature compares computer-assisted English language learning with traditional face-to-face treatments, including 140 computer-assisted learning versus classroom instruction studies, which yield 158 achievement effects. After examining the methodological quality, the overall weighted average effect size for achievement was +0.50, and it was heterogeneous. The results indicated that computer-assisted instruction had an overall medium effect on English language development. Moreover, the mixed effects model for moderator analyses indicated that Web-based instruction yielded a larger mean effect (+0.54) than traditional computer-assisted instruction (+0.47). Further analyses led to the identification of four important moderators of English language learning: type of interaction, communication mode, language learning context, and treatment duration. Insights into the evolution, not only in the technological but also in the sociological context and educational theories, and the future prospects of computer-assisted instruction are discussed.",

The purpose of the study is to understand how teachers and students exploit the complementarity of the two delivery formats to improve the learning experience. The study first examines how the presence of an online component affects the F2F portion of the course by comparing it to a corresponding section of the same course taught entirely F2F. The findings of this first part of the study show major differences between the two delivery formats regarding teaching strategies and teaching presence. The second part of the study uses LMS data to analyze student participation in the online component of the blended course. Data were gathered to measure active participation, passive participation and continuity. The results show that online behaviors distinguish less successful students from more successful ones, and that there is a strong correlation between low levels of online participation and low grades in the course. Continuity proved to be the strongest predictor variable for success in the course. The results have important implications for course design and the use of learning analytics for the early identification of at-risk students.",

Transpacific groups of students participated in online discussions of pre-assigned topics and a series of supplemental, reflective tasks such as in-class discussions, weekly journals, and individual interviews. Using a three-stage grounded theory data coding strategy, major contradictions were identified and analyzed. This case study presents negotiation of an emergent contradiction concerning learner expectations and manners of interaction between two transpacific groups.

    "description": "This qualitative case study examined the influence of the use of VoiceThread technology on the feedback process for thesis writing in two online asynchronous graduate courses. The influence on instructor feedback process and graduate student writers' perceptions of the use of VoiceThread were the foci of the study. Master's-level students (n = 18) in two different degree programs received and responded to multiple rounds of instructor feedback on their thesis paper via VoiceThread technology for one semester. Instructor and student comments on VoiceThread and an open-ended survey of students' experiences using VoiceThread in the course were analyzed. Findings show that VoiceThread promoted a two-way dialogue between the instructors and the students during the revision process, students had a generally positive perception of the use of the technology, and that instructors' feedback processes were impacted in different ways by the use of the technology.",

By seeing game elements as &quot;motivational affordances,&quot; and formalizing the relationship between these elements and motivational affordances, it is the position of this article that gamification can be effectively applied to improve software systems across many different application domains. The research reported here aims to formalize the relationship between game elements and motivation, toward making gamification's use more systematic. The focus is on the development of a framework linking commonly occurring game elements with the components of a psychological motivational model known as the &quot;self-determination theory,&quot; coupled with a proposed framework of commonly occurring game elements. The goal is to inform system designers who would like to leverage gamification of the game elements they would need to employ as motivational affordances.",

We conducted a survey to know the opinion of computer science instructors and undergraduate students on MOOCs in an Indian university in March 2018. Of the 26 instructors and 273 students who participated, 73% instructors and 87% students reported to have attended MOOCs. We found that 50% instructors and 72% students considered MOOCs to be a more comprehensive source of knowledge and 54% instructors and 76% students felt that MOOCs let students learn faster when compared to courses taught in a classroom. Moreover, 58% instructors believed that the courses they teach in classrooms can also be taught effectively through MOOCs. The instructors and students appreciated several aspects of MOOCs. However, the students had an opinion that MOOCs can augment classroom teaching but cannot replace it. MOOCs on computer programming (22%), artificial intelligence (9%), and computer networking (8%) were found to be particularly popular among the students.",

    "description": "This study investigated clicker-use impact in a legal German lecture, given to 65 French students of Law in which the learning focus was both language and content. 36 participants who attended the entire course were tested. Upon their introductory session, students took a preliminary two-fold multiple-choice questionnaire involving 16 questions on legal terminology and 16 on course content. Throughout the 10- week semester, the lecturer administered all questions during regular courses. Each weekly session was conducted alternately with or without clickers. Students answered half of the questions about language and content using clickers, whereas the remaining half involved standard conditions with volunteers raising their hands to answer. At the end of their term, students took the same initial questionnaire as a post-test. A quantitative analysis was performed to assess (a) the enhancement of the acquisition of legal terminology and course content through clicker use and (b) the impact of learners' pre-test scores on learning gains regarding terminology and content with or without clickers. The clicker group outperformed the non-clicker group with regard to a post-test concerning legal terminology. The findings demonstrate that clicker use alleviates the cognitive load induced by learning both new terminology and content.",

Both classes participated in an individual pre-test writing, a writing task, and an individual post-test writing over a 9-week period. Students in the wiki group worked in pairs via wikis to produce an expository essay; students in the individual group produced their essays alone. Learners' written production on the pre-test and post-test was analyzed in terms of content and organization, and linguistic complexity and accuracy. Results indicated a significant effect for wiki-mediated collaborative writing on the content quality and linguistic accuracy of learners' individual writing in L2. Its effect on the organization and linguistic complexity, however, was less evident.",

The test, which consisted of 100 items distributed across five item types (sound discrimination, grammar, listening comprehension, reading comprehension, and vocabulary), was tested with 2,201 incoming first-year and transfer students at a large, Midwestern public university. Analyses of internal consistency and validity revealed the test to be reliable and valid with regard to its functionality, the content covered on the exam, and the consistency with which placement decisions could be made. Findings are discussed in light of the AUA model developed for the placement test, and practical suggestions for university-level language program instructors and testing administrators are outlined.",

    "description": "Despite the current potential to use computers to automatically generate a large range of text-based indices, many issues remain unresolved about how to apply these data in established language teaching and assessment contexts. One way to resolve these issues is to explore the degree to which automatically generated indices, which are reflective of key measures of text quality, align with parallel measures derived from locally relevant, human evaluations of texts. This study describes the automated evaluation of 104 English as a second language texts through use of the computational tool Coh-Metrix, which was used to generate indices reflecting text cohesion, lexical characteristics, and syntactic complexity. The same texts were then independently evaluated by two experienced human assessors through use of an analytic scoring rubric. The interrelationships between the computer and human generated evaluations of the texts are presented in this paper with a particular focus on the automatically generated indices that were most strongly linked to the human generated measures. A synthesis of these findings is then used to discuss the role that such automated evaluation may have in the teaching and assessment of second language writing.",

    "description": "Today, people want to consult dictionaries of good quality, but they expect them to be available online for free. For this reason, publishers need advertisements to cover the costs of producing and maintaining online dictionary content. This paper aims to investigate the role of advertisements in language reception, production, and learning following online dictionary consultation. It also undertakes to determine whether advertisements in an online dictionary affect the time needed for dictionary-based decoding and encoding. In the experiment, participants consulted one of the most prestigious dictionaries of English for foreign learners, OALD9 (&quot;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary,&quot; 9th edition). Two versions of the dictionary were employed in the study: one that includes advertisements and is available online free of charge, and its advertisement-free counterpart, OALD9 Premium. In the receptive task, the participants were requested to explain the meaning of new English words. In the productive one, they had to use the words in sentences. Meaning retention was checked in the immediate post-test. The research reveals that advertisements in OALD9 impede language reception, production, and learning, and also extend the time for comprehending new words. Suggestions for further research into advertisements on dictionary websites are presented in the final part of the paper.",

    "description": "Despite their potential benefits, teacher-created animated cartoons have not found much room in second-language (L2) research, probably due to some technical challenges involved in creating them. This paper reports the findings of a mixed-methods embedded experimental study, designed to test the impact of tailor-made animated cartoons on the correct use of common punctuation rules in English. The participants were 112 Turkish-first language (L1) learners of English, assigned to either the treatment or control group through random cluster sampling. The instructional materials in the treatment group included teacher-created animated cartoons, exercises designed using SCORM-compliant software, and a forum for discussions in Moodle. The participants in the control group, on the other hand, used PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) instead of animated cartoons and completed the same follow-up activities. Quantitative results suggested that the treatment and control groups' post-test and late post-test scores significantly differed in favour of the former. Moreover, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and document analysis revealed that the participants, especially those in the treatment group, viewed this learning experience highly positively. The findings globally imply that tailor-made animated cartoons might facilitate the learning of punctuation and help raise students' awareness of it.",

Pre- and post-tests were used to measure the participants' perception and production of the target features. The results show that training had a positive impact on the participants' perception and production of the target sounds. Even though the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for every sound in every task, the data reveal that the approach adopted could foster substantial improvements in the participants' pronunciation of features that tend to be fossilised, even after short periods of training.",

The fanfiction project, The Blogging Hobbit, was carried out as part of a course in the teacher education program at a Swedish university for students who were specializing in teaching English at the secondary school level. Participants were 122 students who completed the course in 2013 and 2014. In both classes, students were organized into groups of three to six to write collaborative blog-based role-play fanfiction of a missing moment from JRR Tolkien's fantasy novel &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The 31 resulting pieces of collaborative fanfiction, the online formats they were published in, the 122 reflective essays produced by the two classes, and interviews with a focal group of participants were used to explore how technology and learners' experience with this technology may have mediated the resulting stories. In addition, the classroom fanfiction texts were compared with comparable online writing published in the fanfiction site Archive of Our Own (Ao3) to identify thematic and stylistic differences. The results showed that students' lack of familiarity with publishing in blogs often posed a challenge that some groups were able to overcome or exploit to facilitate or enhance the readability of their completed stories. Compared to online fanfiction, the classroom fanfiction was less innovative with respect to focal characters yet more collective in its focus, with stories being told from multiple characters' perspectives.",

During a four-week experiment, 20 sophomore students were randomly assigned to the experimental group with MEVLA-GF support or the control group with MEVLA-NGF support for English vocabulary learning. Analytical results show that performance in vocabulary acquisition and retention by the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Moreover, questionnaire results confirm that MEVLA-GF is more effective and satisfying for English vocabulary learning than MEVLA-NGF. Spearman rank correlation results show that involvement and dependence on gamified functions were positively correlated with vocabulary learning performance.",

The paper first addresses the potential of opportunities for stimulating student creativity and motivation. Creativity has been highlighted as a core competency and has garnered considerable interest in many fields in recent years; however, creativity and creative writing are rarely cultivated in EFL writing classrooms. This study uses a digital game and designs a creative writing project to provide an authentic learning opportunity through which students were able to develop their creativity, use the target language in a meaningful way, and enjoy learning. A murder mystery game, &quot;Her Story,&quot; was selected because it provides a springboard for creative writing due to its fragmented and ambiguous narrative. Based on the game plot, 25 Korean university students reimagined the narrative in creative writing projects of their own. The study analyzes the students' writing according to three constructs in Torrance's model of creativity: originality, flexibility, and elaboration. The results demonstrate how the students' writing exhibits considerable creativity in all three constructs. Student reflection papers and surveys indicate that participating in the project enhanced the students' motivation for and engagement in learning.",

    "description": "Corpora have given rise to a wide range of lexicographic resources aimed at helping novice users of academic English with their writing. This includes academic vocabulary lists, a variety of textbooks, and even a bespoke academic English dictionary. However, writers may not be familiar with these resources or may not be sufficiently aware of the lexical shortcomings of their emerging texts to trigger the need to use such help in the first place. Moreover, writers who have to stop writing to look up a word can be distracted from getting their ideas down on paper. The ColloCaid project (www.collocaid.uk) aims to address these problems by integrating information on collocation with text editors. In this paper, we share the research underpinning the initial development of ColloCaid by detailing the rationale of (1) the lexicographic database we are compiling to support the collocation needs of novice users of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and (2) the preliminary visualisation decisions taken to present information on collocation to EAP users without disrupting their writing. We conclude the paper by outlining the next steps in the research.",

    "description": "This review examines the second language acquisition (SLA) literature with regard to the role of &quot;massively multiplayer online games&quot; (MMOGs) in second language (L2) learning. It focuses on commercially developed off-the-shelf (COTS) MMOGs only (some of them modified for educational purposes such as Reinders' &amp; Wattana's work). It surveys the current empirical research to find out which aspects of L2 learning have been investigated, how they were studied, and what the findings suggest in relation to L2 learning opportunities and outcomes within and beyond MMOG contexts. We synthesized the findings of 31 studies reporting empirical evidence about the role of MMOGs in L2 learning. We observed that the empirical research in this area is mainly qualitative and that L2-related motivational and affective factors, L2 vocabulary, and learners' communicative competence (or discourse management strategies) are the most widely investigated topics. Based on the findings, our paper presents a model that depicts hypothetical interrelationships among (a) MMOG designed settings, (b) the social and affective affordances provided in these settings, (c) L2 learning opportunities, and (d) the L2 learning outcomes achieved. We conclude that MMOGs provide socially supportive and emotionally safe (i.e. low-language-anxiety) environments that afford multiple opportunities for L2 learning and socialization, which, in turn, help L2 learners to enrich their L2 vocabulary repertoire and enhance their communicative competence in the target language.",

The university students then presented, evaluated, and revised stories in both face-to-face and digital contexts through multiple modalities and technologies. MNDA further provided tools and methods for analyzing the students' discursive processes and agentive experiences of L2 storytelling. The results of MNDA showed that the proper use of narrative elements, discourse structures, and stylistic devices, as well as bodily, visual, and video resources, assisted the students in developing multimodal designs and storytelling styles. This technology-mediated discourse approach to L2 storytelling suggests the importance of teaching and researching broader narrative contexts and activities other than simply elocution in multimodal communicative activities.",

    "description": "The growing availability of mobile technologies has contributed to an increase in mobile-assisted language learning in which learners can autonomously study a second language (L2) anytime or anywhere (e.g. Kukulska-Hulme, Lee &amp; Norris, 2017; Reinders &amp; Benson, 2017). Research investigating the effectiveness of such study for L2 learning, however, has been limited, especially regarding large-scale commercial L2 learning apps, such as Duolingo. Although one commissioned research study found favorable language learning outcomes (Vesselinov &amp; Grego, 2012), limited independent research has reported issues related to learner persistence, motivation, and program efficacy (Lord, 2015; Nielson, 2011). The current study investigates the semester-long learning experiences and results of nine participants learning Turkish on Duolingo. The participants showed improvement on L2 measures at the end of the study, and results indicate a positive, moderate correlation between the amount of time spent on Duolingo and learning gains. In terms of perceptions of their experiences, the participants generally viewed Duolingo's flexibility and gamification aspects positively; however, variability in motivation to study and frustration with instructional materials were also expressed.",

    "author": "Tecedor, Marta, Campos-Dintrans, Gonzalo",
    "description": "This study adds to the literature on computer-mediated communication (CMC) by examining the impact of online voice recording (VR) activities and peer-to-peer videoconferencing (VC) conversations on the development of beginning Spanish learners' speaking performance. Specifically, this paper explores (1) whether VR and VC activities promote oral proficiency, and if so, whether those gains can be seen both in presentational and interpersonal modes of communication; and (2) whether VR and VC activities foster oral proficiency in similar ways to face-to-face (F2F) communication. A quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test design was used in the study. Three sections of a first semester Spanish course were assigned to one of the following conditions: F2F, VR, and VC. Complexity, accuracy, and fluency measures were used to analyze learners' speaking performance in the two tasks. A mixed effects model analysis was used to investigate differences across time as well as among groups. Results show that both F2F communication and VR activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and fluency in interpersonal tasks, although F2F produces superior results regarding complexity in presentational tasks. VC activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and complexity, accuracy, and fluency in interpersonal tasks. Overall, this study shows that medium is not merely a delivery device but has important implications for learning outcomes. In this sense, these findings contribute to answering the wider question of how the use of technology in second language instruction plays a decisive role in current teaching practices.",

    "author": "Lee, Hansol, Warschauer, Mark, Lee, Jang Ho",
    "description": "In this study, we used a data-mining approach to identify hidden groups in a corpus-based second-language (L2) vocabulary experiment. After a vocabulary pre-test, a total of 132 participants performed three online reading tasks (in random orders) equipped with the following glossary types: (1) concordance lines and definitions of target lexical items, (2) concordance lines of target lexical items, and (3) no glossary information. Although the results of a previous study based on variable-centred analysis (i.e. multiple regression analysis) revealed that more glossary information could lead to better learning outcomes (Lee, Warschauer &amp; Lee, 2017), using a model-based clustering technique in the present study allowed us to unearth learner types not identified in the previous analysis. Instead of the performance pattern found in the previous study (more glossary led to higher gains), we identified one learner group who exhibited their ability to make successful use of concordance lines (and thus are optimized for data-driven learning, or DDL; Johns, 1991), and another group who showed limited L2 vocabulary learning when exposed to concordance lines only. Further, our results revealed that L2 proficiency intersects with vocabulary gains of different learner types in complex ways. Therefore, using this technique in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) research to understand differential effects of accommodations can help us better identify hidden learner types and provide personalized CALL instruction.",

    "description": "This exploratory study focuses on international students' usage of digital tools in order to understand what role such tools play in the transition to their new academic environments and what learning opportunities they provide. Not only do digital tools accompany international students' social, cultural, and linguistic transitions as they move to France to further their language competence, but their usage also reveals part of the social and semiotic adjustments they have to make in the process. Sixteen international students who volunteered for the study were given a smartphone application with which they could track learning opportunities by taking pictures and writing textual commentaries. The data, collected over a period of five weeks, thus include the resulting entries these participants shared in their mobile multimodal diaries with the researchers, as well as an end-of-project debriefing that was conducted to shed further light on the international students' digital habits and their attitudes towards self-tracking. This study indicates that digital tools can play an important and pervasive role in facilitating international students' linguistic development and their dealings with everyday life abroad. It also confirms that self-tracking apps can be instrumental in enhancing students' awareness of learning opportunities outside the classroom.",

    "description": "Data-driven learning (DDL; Johns, 1991), involving students' hands-on use of corpora for self-guided language learning, is a methodology now increasingly used in many tertiary contexts to enhance the teaching of disciplinary postgraduate thesis writing. However, there are still few studies tracking students' actual engagement with corpora for DDL. This mixed-methods study reports on the tracking of students' corpus use via a purpose-built corpus query and data visualisation platform integrated into a large postgraduate disciplinary thesis writing program at a university in Hong Kong. Data on corpus usage history (e.g. times of access, duration of use), query syntax (e.g. query lexis/phraseology and use of wildcards and part-of-speech tags), query function (e.g. frequency lists/distribution, concordance sorting and collocation) and query filters (e.g. searches by faculty, discipline, or thesis section) were collected from 327 students spanning over 11,000 individual corpus queries. The results show significant interdisciplinary and inter-/intra-user trends and variation in the use of particular corpus functions and query syntax adopted by corpus users. Students varied in the type of knowledge (e.g. domain-specific, language-specific) they were accessing, and frequently went beyond the exemplars of the DDL course materials to generate unique queries under their own initiative. Qualitative case study data from three corpus users' activity logs also show distinctive individual corpus engagement by query frequency and function. These data provide a clearer insight into what students actually do during DDL and the different directions and trajectories that individual users take as a result of DDL. All accompanying DDL tasks are also included as supplementary materials.",

    "description": "The use of videoconferencing technology to support the delivery of language programs shows great potential in regional and rural settings where a lack of access to specialist teachers limits equitable access to education. In this article, we investigate the establishment of two regional and rural primary school networks in Australia for videoconferenced language learning. Adopting a perspective taken from the discipline of information systems called structuration theory, we examine how the technology they use both changes and is changed by its use in language learning, and how schools and teachers take control of technology and adapt their educational approaches. Case studies were carried out on the two networks using multiple data sources, including interviews and observation of language classes. The findings reveal that even with the same conceptual foundations and aims, divergent models of practice emerge as sustainable adaptations to localised factors. These differences are shaped by, among other things, an interplay between the quality of infrastructure, prior knowledge, and the &quot;material properties&quot; of the technology, including its functions, limits, and deployment in physical space. A closer look at these practices illustrates limitations and possibilities specifically for language education, but also more broadly illustrates how the success of these videoconferencing initiatives are influenced by a nuanced combination of social, educational, and technological factors.",

    "description": "Integrating technology into the foreign language classroom has introduced challenging demands for prospective teachers in designing technology-enhanced lessons. Thus, careful guidance is required to help pre-service teachers identify, integrate, and reflect on appropriate technologies to create more learning opportunities. The present study aims to guide pre-service teachers in incorporating technology into their situated teaching practices during a 12-week practicum experience via a step-by-step training procedure. It explores both their own ideas and those of students about technology-enhanced lessons. For this purpose, eight pre-service teachers and 95 students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context in Turkey participated in the study. Qualitative analyses of diaries and focus group interviews revealed that prospective teachers and their students had positive attitudes towards integrating technology into a second language and/or foreign language (L2) class albeit a few concerns and problems were raised. Technology-enhanced classes promoted language skills, contributed to creating a favorable and motivating learning atmosphere, fostered active participation, and helped pre-service teachers tailor their lessons to their students' needs and interests. By offering a situated learning opportunity to incorporate technology into L2 classes blended with reflective practice, findings of the study may illuminate future practices for successful technology integration in language teaching.",

The need for life-long learners with advanced learning skills and the ability to self-regulate has motivated this deeper exploration of the ways to enhance learner strategy use towards more self-regulated and skilful learners. This study therefore sets out to assess the significance of interventions reinforced with prompts while supporting cognitive and metacognitive strategy use by learners. An intervention with four learning assignments enhanced with prompts for the treatment group was applied in a sample of 56 undergraduates. The findings confirmed the significance of prompts when supporting learner strategy use. Besides, this study strengthens the idea that metacognitive strategy use has to be supported in combination with cognitive strategies.",

Researchers believe that paradigm shift exists in different domains of blended learning ranging from pedagogy to teacher roles. The present research, thus, used A 27-item and five-likert questionnaire (the STRI) to study how 153 university students perceived the roles of their teachers in both f2f learning and online learning of a blended English course. Statistical analyses revealed two main results: first, all the three sub-roles of teachers in f2f learning had significantly higher means than those in online learning; then in f2f learning, cognitive role had the highest means whereas in online learning, managerial role had the highest means. The findings indicate that, in students' eyes, teachers had greater impact in f2f learning than in online learning. Furthermore, cognitive role of teachers was perceived to be the most impactful in f2f learning whereas managerial role of teachers was regarded as the most notable in online learning. Further comparison of particular items of the questionnaire revealed more specific differences of teacher roles between the two learning modes.",

    "description": "Corpora are well-known for the affordance to make linguistic regularities salient. Since the coinage of the term 'data-driven learning' (DDL) in the 1990s, much has been done to investigate the effects of DDL on learning vocabulary, most notably lexico-grammatical patterns. However, less researched is how learners construct vocabulary knowledge from scratch with DDL approaches. While generalizing recurring lexico-grammatical patterns is relatively straightforward, deducing meanings of unknown words from truncated concordances can be challenging. In this exploratory study, learners constructed knowledge of new words with the inductive approach or deductive one; and their retention of word knowledge was measured holistically using a word knowledge framework. The ways in which learners availed themselves of corpus data in the construction of word knowledge were also examined. The results provide evidence that the inductive approach is more conducive to developing collocational knowledge; and the deductive approach provides the opportunity to consolidate definitional knowledge of the newly acquired words.",

In the spirit of finding synergies and learning from each other's experiences in specific local contexts, we address the following research questions: (1) How does the local context, researcher and learner goals, and technological possibilities influence the design of each computer application? (2) Based on the examination of the three programs, what can we learn in view of redesign options and suggest to future developers of such programs?",

Students mentioned in the formal evaluation of the course as well as in a needs analysis that they would like to have a chance to revise the course material by accessing a computer programme. The lecturer of the course therefore decided to design a computer programme for the above mentioned course that could be used as a revision tool. Four of the design principles of Mayer (2009) were used to design the computer programme.

    "description": "This article presents the results of a systematic review of the literature on dialogue-based CALL, resulting in a conceptual framework for research on the matter. Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots\u2026). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL, we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy, we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus, we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL, which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer, on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning, we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these &quot;branching,&quot; &quot;form-focused,&quot; &quot;goal-oriented&quot; and &quot;reactive&quot; systems, and we describe their corresponding interactional, instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems, distinguishing observational, survey and experimental studies, and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development, identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally, we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches, and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.",

    "description": "In recent years, numerous English vocabulary learning-assisted apps have been developed to enlarge learners' English vocabulary through mobile learning. However, the ability of learners to engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) importantly affects performance in autonomously learning English vocabulary using mobile apps. Therefore, this study developed an English vocabulary learning app with a self-regulated learning mechanism (EVLAPP-SRLM) to help learners improve their SRL abilities, with a view to improving their learning performance and motivation in a mobile learning context. To evaluate the performance of the proposed EVLAPP-SRLM, a total of 46 Grade 5 students were recruited from two classes in an elementary school of Taoyuan City, Taiwan, to participate in the experiment. The two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental or control groups, which used, respectively, the EVLAPP-SRLM and the English vocabulary learning app without a self-regulated learning mechanism (EVLAPP-NSRLM) to support their English vocabulary learning during a period of two weeks. Experimental results indicate that the learners in the experimental group exhibited significantly better learning performance and motivation than those in the control group. Moreover, the learners who used EVLAPP-SRLM exhibited significantly greater learning performance and motivation than those who used EVLAPP-NSRLM, regardless of gender. Analytical results also verify that the EVLAPP-SRLM provides more benefits to field-dependent learners than to field-independent learners with respect to learning performance and motivation.",

Keeping this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of a flipped classroom on enhancing EFL learners' pragmatic competence. To this end, 60 EFL learners from two universities in Iran were assigned into flipped and conventional groups. In the flipped group, the course materials were posted through Telegram app before the class, and the class time was mostly devoted to communicative activities. To elicit the required data, multiple sources of data collection, including a Discourse Completion Test (DCT), a study log, the teacher's field notes, a Learning Experience Questionnaire (LEQ), a written self-report survey, and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, were used. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the participants of the flipped group were more engaged with the course contents and significantly outperformed their counterparts in the conventional group in the post-test. The results of the questionnaires suggested that most participants of the flipped group enjoyed learning English in a flipped learning environment, and willingly accepted Telegram as a suitable platform in learning language. The authors present insights into the impact of flipped classrooms on appropriate use of English refusals, the participants' perception of the flipped learning experience, their level of participation inside and outside the class, their impression of the online platform, Telegram, and offer implications for practice.",

Both English drafts were analyzed using two types of online computational assessments to compare and evaluate grammatical components of writing quality and lexical features. Results indicate that the GT English texts presented a number of components of significantly higher writing quality than those of students' SW texts, by having more words, fewer mistakes in spelling and grammar, and fewer errors per words. In addition, there were more advanced-level words in the students' GT texts than in their SW ones.

In contrast to previous C-DA studies, learners in this study played an active role in deciding on different types of visual, audio, and textual mediations required to deal with comprehending the main ideas of 15 passages. The software was programmed to present 15 reading comprehension passages alongside three sets of visual/audio/textual mediations presented strategically (implicit to explicit) in a prefabricated standardized fashion to assess and co-construct emerging zone of proximal development (ZPD). The learners' learning potential score based on their own mediation tendencies uncovered the effectiveness of visual, audio, and textual mediations in assisting the learners to reach independency in grasping the main ideas of reading comprehension passages. Statistically, a paired samples t-test revealed the learners' ZPD enhancement in comparison with their developed ability. Overall, the results demonstrated that it is feasible to respond to individual learning preferences with fine-tuned electronic mediations in the C-DA context of reading comprehension.",

    "description": "In the main, evaluation in CALL has focused on the assessment of the individual use of technology in accord with the principles of second language acquisition. Now that CALL focuses on the full integration of technology in language programs, evaluators are urged to take into account a wide range of factors that span institutional policy, departmental culture and classroom practice. In this study, we use an argument-based approach to evaluate technology integration within an English language program at a leading university in Vietnam. Using a layered approach and qualitative techniques to gather data, we examine how administrators and lecturers at the departmental, or meso, level perceive technology integration in an English language program. Results of the study inform technology integration, stakeholder identification, resource allocation and curriculum interpretation, and concludes with a discussion of the utility of blended language program evaluation.",

    "description": "This study examined factors that might have affected EFL learners' willingness to communicate (WTC) in the extramural digital (ED) environment, a rapidly emerging L2 communication context. The investigator conducted a semi-structured interview with 98 EFL students from three Korean universities. Drawing on grounded theory, &quot;socio-political&quot; (Korea's K-12 instruction), &quot;contextual&quot; (familiarity with interlocutors and communities), and &quot;individual&quot; variables (L2 self-confidence and anxiety) emerged as major sources of influence on participants' L2 WTC. Additionally, these sub-variables appeared to interact simultaneously during L2 communication in the ED context. This study contributes to further advancing our understanding of L2 WTC in a CALL environment. It also offers pedagogical insights into how L2 teachers can facilitate EFL learners' WTC in a range of extramural digital environments where their L2 WTC is very different from face-to-face classroom and extracurricular digital settings.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effects of captioned videos on ESL primary school students' comprehension of video content. A total of 182 primary school students watched two short English story videos in one of three conditions: fully captioned videos (N = 62), keyword captioned videos (N = 63), and uncaptioned videos (N = 57). Each group included learners with higher and lower levels of English proficiency. Two videos were selected, and the second video was watched twice. After each video, all participants took a comprehension test, including global comprehension and detailed questions. Findings revealed that fully captioned group achieved the best results on the global comprehension questions. Significant differences between the fully captioned and keyword captioned videos on the detailed comprehension questions were not detected. Learners with a higher level of English proficiency and those who watched the video for a second time achieved better comprehension scores. These findings suggest that full captioning videos, rather than keyword captioning videos, should be considered when using video-based comprehension activities for ESL primary school learners. However, learners' English level and the frequency of video viewing should also be considered.",

To this end, by adding two external factors (i.e. computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety) to the technology acceptance model (TAM), we surveyed 245 Chinese college students and tested a number of proposed hypotheses using their response data. Results revealed that learners' behavioural intention to use AWE is directly determined by perceived usefulness, attitude towards using, and computer self-efficacy; and it is indirectly influenced by learners' perceived ease of use; learners' computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety play no role to perceived usefulness. Instead, they significantly affect perceived ease of use. Implications of these results are discussed as well.",

    "description": "This study on online L2 interactions compares lexical word search between an audioconferencing and a videoconferencing condition. Nine upper-intermediate learners of English describe a previously unseen photograph in either the videoconferencing or the audioconferencing condition. A semantic feature analysis is adopted to compare their interactions. To evaluate the contribution of visual and verbal modes, a quantitative analysis examines the distribution of the referential properties of one target lexical item: &quot;tunnel earring.&quot; It suggests that pushed output produced in the videoconferencing condition is lexically richer. Then, in view of these results, focusing on two learners, one from the audioconferencing condition and one from the videoconferencing condition, a fine-grained multimodal analysis of the qualitative features of gestures and speech complements the quantitative results. It demonstrates how the videoconferencing condition allows the learner to embody salient physical referential properties of the lexical item, before transferring the referential information to the verbal mode, to produce a semantically rich description. The study will interest researchers working on multimodality and L2 teachers deciding between videoconferencing and audioconferencing as pedagogical options.",

    "author": "Su, You, Li, Yanyan, Liang, Jyh-Chong, Tsai, Chin-Chung",
    "description": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest among language educators in implementing and researching collaborative learning in wiki-based learning environments. However, little empirical evidence has been reported about the role of EFL learners' online self-regulating capacity in their collaborative learning. This study used wiki-based literature circles as an instructional method to engage EFL learners in collaborative learning. Using a mixed research method, this study examined the under-researched relationship between learners' online self-regulation and their attitude toward learning through wiki-based literature circles activities. Quantitative data were collected from two surveys, the online self-regulated English learning (OSEL) and the attitude toward wiki-based literature circles (AWLC), among 228 university students in China. Qualitative data were collected from a follow-up interview of 13 participants to explore further the interplay between the students' online self-regulation and their attitude. The results indicated that students hold positive attitude toward learning through wiki-based literature circles in terms of perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, affection, and behavior. The findings partially confirmed the positive correlations between students' self-regulated learning strategies and their attitudes. More interestingly, stepwise regression analysis revealed that students' goal setting acted as a significant predicator of their perceived usefulness of and self-efficacy in completing wiki-based literature circles activities. Self-evaluation was found to be the variable to predict the learners' affection for and behavior in doing this task. This study highlighted the positive role of students' goal setting and self-evaluation for explaining their attitude toward wiki-based collaborative learning. Pedagogical implications and future work are also addressed.",

    "title": "Beyond Self-Directed Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Learning: A Qualitative Investigation of a Collaborative Approach",
    "author": "Tsai, Pi-hua",
    "description": "In foreign language education, instruction in pronunciation has received less attention than instruction in other language skills. Many teachers do not know how to teach correct pronunciation due to lack of knowledge in pronunciation pedagogy even if they want to or they assume that students pick it up on their own. With the development of technology, automatic speech recognition (ASR) software has been adopted in computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) and has been found to be effective in facilitating pronunciation learning. Nevertheless, CAPT software still has its limitation. Very little research has been done on what difficulties students may encounter during practice with the system, such as how to read the feedback provided by the software. Moreover, very few CAPT studies investigated how collaborative learning can be integrated to augment the advantages of the technology. Efforts also have to be made on how to increase the enjoyment of learners using it when their motivation is curtailed by the unchanging feedback the CAPT system provides. The present study aims to investigate how those software users feel about the mediated assistance the system offers, their difficulty and attitudes toward using it, and, above all, how peers can help to mediate the pronunciation learning of students using &quot;MyET,&quot; a CAPT system designed in Taiwan. Two groups of junior college students (N = 60) practiced the system for 10 weeks with or without their peers. A qualitative investigation found that the collaborative group wrote down more statements about how they had benefited from the software than about their pronunciation difficulties. They also reported that the feedback helped raise their awareness of pronunciation errors. In the collaborative practice with the CAPT system, they revealed that they could explore more functions the software provided and had fun. This study further examines how peers interacted, analyzed, and discussed the effects of collaboration on computer-assisted pronunciation learning. Finally, suggestions were made for teachers interested in conducting CAPT in a collaborative context.",

It also investigated the short and long term impact of the DA mediations on writing performance in new and more challenging contexts by conducting near and delayed synchronous transcendence (TR) sessions. Moreover, it explored the learners' perceptions towards the impact of online synchronous DA on academic writing skills. Three EFL university students, who were preparing themselves for the IELTS examination, were selected as the participants of the study. IELTS academic writing task 1 and task 2, marked by IELTS writing band descriptors, were used to assess the learners' academic writing skills. Moreover, a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess the learners' perceptions towards the impact of online DA on academic writing skills. Tracking the learners' microgenetic development through generated mediation and reciprocity typologies, the findings indicated academic writing development in all the four areas of task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexicon, and grammatical range and accuracy in both writing task 1 and task 2. In the TR sessions the learners showed some difficulties in transferring some parts of their developed writing skills to more challenging contexts. Thematic analysis, used to analyse the interview data, highlighted the learners' positive perceptions towards the impact of online DA on academic writing skills.",

    "description": "This study investigated the effects of Facebook and Twitter on foreign language (Chinese) learners' written production in both short- (10 days) and long-term (50 days) pseudo-experimental settings. Adopting two concepts (i.e. symmetric vs. asymmetric) from matrix theory in social network analysis, we categorized Facebook as a symmetric social networking site (SNS) and Twitter as an asymmetric SNS. Results show that Facebook participants were more conservative or not highly engaged in building their social connections. In both settings, Facebook participants posted more sentences than Twitter participants per day, and more posts on Facebook were interactive. The Facebook participants believed more strongly that reading others' posts improved their reading skills. Facebook also displayed evidence on promoting explicit corrective feedback. More interestingly, Facebook appeared to be a more dynamic system; the quality of writing seemed to change over time. There were more grammatical errors on Facebook than on Twitter in both settings. In the long-term setting (not in the short-term setting), a moderate positive correlation was found between the number of characters and the number of grammar errors for Facebook, but not for Twitter. We conclude that symmetric SNSs facilitate more interactions, potentially providing a more effective platform for peer-to-peer corrective feedback compared to asymmetric SNSs.",

    "description": "Prior research has shown that EFL learners who wrote collaboratively with partners using wikis improved the content quality and language accuracy of their L2 individual writing more than students who wrote individually. Drawing on the dataset from Hsu and Lo's study, the current study explores the nature of the students' collaborative dialogue that occurred during wiki collaborative writing and the potential link between wiki collaboration and development in individual L2 writing. The students, working in self-selected groups, collaboratively completed a writing task with two drafts via wikis. Wiki pages created by the students, including the comments, discussion and history modules, were analysed for the occurrence of content-, organization- and language-related episodes. The total number, focus and resolution of the episodes were tallied and analysed. Results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that (1) students produced significantly more language-related episodes than content-related and organization- related ones, (2) organization-related episodes occurred the least frequently, (3) students were able to resolve the majority of the content-, organization-, and language-related issues successfully and (4) students demonstrated a preference to work with grammar over lexis during wiki-mediated collaborative writing process. The results are discussed in the light of Hsu and Lo's study. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are discussed.",

    "description": "From a psycholinguistic perspective of view, there are many cognitive differences that matter to individuals' second-language acquisition (SLA). Although many computer-assisted tools have been developed to capture and narrow the differences among learners, the use of these strategies may be highly risky because changing the environments or the participants may lead to failure. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based computational model to simulate the environment to which students are exposed. The ANN computational model equips English teachers with the ability to quickly find the predicting factors to learners' overall English competences and also provides teachers with the ability to find abnormal students, based on reviewing their individualized ANN trajectories. Finally, by observing the compound effects of cognitive factors using the same evaluation scale, new hypotheses about the mutual relationships among the phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory, and long-term memory abilities of their students can be generated. Our experimental ANNs suggested three detailed corresponding conclusions for the participants' English teachers. These results provide teachers with guidance in designing and applying cognitive ability-related intervention strategies in their L2 pedagogical activities.",

    "description": "Can mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) foster self-directed learning outside the classroom? This article examines informal, out-of-class engagement with a MALL tool: Duolingo. After being invited to use Duolingo, 118 higher education language students agreed to have their activity in the application tracked. In addition to the data collected from the Duolingo dashboard, questionnaires, as well as semi-structured interviews, were implemented. Results viewed from Garrison's dimensions of self-directed learning (motivation, self-management and self-monitoring) reveal inconsistencies between what students think about the app and what they do with it. Questionnaires suggest that Duolingo can encourage out-of-class learning through fun activities, but interviews reveal a lack of sustained motivation, self-monitoring and self-management reflected in the low usage of the application. Tracking data reveals that students lack the time for out-of-class MALL during course weeks and are more active during holidays. The results highlight the importance of a context in which users are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning. However, most students will, besides encouragement, also need training and support for their self-directed learning.",

The focus of the research was to evaluate the course from the teachers' perspective while identifying possible stumbling blocks and challenges that could be used to refine and enhance the course and the teacher preparation program in successive iterations. Teachers completed a questionnaire that sought to reveal their beliefs, attitudes and experiences using technology for language instruction. The study concluded that teachers perceive more affordances in using technology to practice receptive skills (listening, reading) than productive skills (speaking, writing). Teachers evaluated the teacher preparation prior to the course as sufficient but expressed contradictory attitudes towards using technology for language instruction which need to be understood within the context of the institutional culture and the decision-making process behind technology adoption.",

They then received immediate teacher feedback on appropriate use in context and accurate use in grammar. Near the end of semester, the students completed close-ended and open-ended surveys. The survey results revealed four benefits of this kind of feedback: (a) Induce Comfort and Active Learning; (b) Increase Interest and Satisfaction; (c) Enhance Cooperation and Sharing; and (d) Improve Word Use. Five constraints were also reported but these earned very low mean scores, suggesting they were not serious problems. The open-ended survey questions discovered that technology played a crucial role in receiving timely high-quality feedback, and keeping students engaged.

This research verifies teachers' perception about the progress in communicative and digital competences in primary education children (N= 201) participating in a collaborative digital storytelling project supported by the Department of Education of the Principality of Asturias (Spain). The descriptive analysis shows teachers' qualitative assessment, related to the change perceived after DST creation. The teachers used an instrument consisting of 15 qualitative indicators and based on an assessment rubric, which was validated by means of the Delphi method. The results reveal that -- according to these instructors' perception -- such a collaborative digital narrative helped to foster both competences in the participating students. They all improve qualitatively, especially students enrolled in the higher stages, through the production of written compositions for DST (thus practicing with vocabulary, spelling and punctuation, as well as verb tenses), the elaboration of scripts with coherent characters and settings, and the expression of the purpose sought with their stories. As for digital competence, the higher stages developed it to a greater extent, due to the greater complexity of the tools used to create DST. In conclusion, teachers see collaborative DST creation as an educational practice which significantly activates schoolchildren's expression and communication skills, since it provides them with suitable environments to acquire story-related competences and abilities, supported by several technological resources and audiovisual techniques.",

    "description": "Compared with classroom learning, online learning requires students to self-regulate their learning processes and to maintain their motivation to achieve their learning goals. This study investigated whether the interventions based on the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction model and the modified Introducing the new concepts, Metacognitive questioning, Practicing, Reviewing and reducing difficulties, Obtaining mastery, Verification, and Enrichment method can promote students' motivation and use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in a web-based mathematics learning environment. Two-hundred thirty-six Chinese high school students were randomly divided into four groups: motivational design group, SRL intervention group, motivational design and SRL intervention group, and the control group. Questionnaires and tests were administered to measure the changes in motivation, use of SRL strategies, and academic gains before and after the respective interventions. Findings of this study suggest that the knowledge gain of students learning mathematics online can be maximized when they receive instructional assistance in both motivation and use of SRL strategies.",

These options are usually chosen according to the instinct of the instructor; however, LMS also provide an opportunity to make data-informed decisions based on data captured by the LMS itself. This article describes an experience with extracting and analyzing LMS data for determining online test option settings that encourage behaviors that promote learning (or discourage behaviors that do not). The data extraction and cleaning process was relatively straightforward, but not without some challenges, and required beyond-novice spreadsheet skills. It seems to have been worth the effort, though, as the insights gained led directly to a change in online test administration, and current option settings seem more appropriate and are supported by data.",

Although an LMS is a driving force in online courses, it is not given in traditional face-to-face environments. The problem is an underutilization of an LMS in face-to-face higher education courses. This qualitative narrative inquiry study explored experiences of 20 instructors utilizing Blackboard Learn in traditional face-to-face courses. One overarching research question guided this study: &quot;What are the experiences of faculty and adjunct instructors concerning the use of LMSs in traditional face-to-face courses in higher education?&quot; The results identified the features and tools in the LMS used most frequently and how they were used in the LMS. Based on this study, it is possible to better understand the educational potential of the LMS to enhance traditional face-to-face courses.",

This study reports on data gathered from an avatar-based immersive experience where teacher-education students gathered in VR spaces for synchronous meetings, learning how to maneuver within the environment, modify their avatars' appearances, and develop preliminary three-dimensional building perspectives. Student reports and instructor observations throughout the course and a final student self-evaluation provided insights into both the challenges experienced and effective practices within this immersive VR environment. Overall, students developed significant trust and camaraderie with their colleagues as they went through problem-solving experiences, finding that initial challenges often subsided with the help of course colleagues. Students enjoyed the experience and considered VR applications for their classrooms. The report concludes with general recommendations for the design of productive VR learning environments within many different settings.",

Although many faculty already integrate diverse perspectives, materials, and pedagogical approaches into their courses, many of us struggle to diversify our course content and teaching strategies. In this article, I overview the process of incorporating diversity into a literacy education course at a Midwestern university in the United States. In particular, I discuss how the use of this instructional technology enhanced students' learning experience of diversity. In so doing, I focus on Plotagon, a video production app that provides a user-friendly script editor to narrate a story through custom-made characters, actions, emotions, scenes, dialogues, music, sound effects, and plots. Participants in this study were 36 male and female undergraduate preservice teachers enrolled in two sections of a required literacy education course. Each student read a multicultural young adult novel of their choice (see Appendix A in the article) and created an animated video version of a few scenes of the book in Plotagon. Integrating Plotagon multimedia medium into this instructional practice brought specific attention to the concept of diversity. The animated scenes improved the delivery of content, demonstrated students' attention to different aspects of diversity, and enhanced their empathy. Also, through the creation of animated video clips, students were able to foster the fundamental skills of analysis, creativity, and engagement into their learning process.",

Noticeably lacking in these endeavors are investigations of language learners' social engagement with others in online spaces to define and negotiate their own meanings of language and language learning. To fill this gap, this study investigated the language ideologies disseminated in a Korean blog that has become a collaborative online English-learning community. Focusing on this blog owner's ideas and her followers' responses, I explored the language ideologies disseminated and negotiated in conversations on language learning and using. This is part of a larger virtual ethnographic study. I analyzed online posts and comments using Gee's situated meanings. Findings suggest that the Korean bloggers subscribe to monolingual ideologies because they are acutely aware of the ideological contexts in Korea surrounding English and are critical about their own language learning and using practices.

Many times, the recording, saving, grading, and sharing process was not efficient. Thus, the feedback cycle from the university supervisor to the teacher candidate was negatively impacted. However, one communication technology tool that has the potential to facilitate the feedback process is video annotation software. This communication technology uses the storage within a remote server, known also as a cloud, to store videos that include typed commentary that is in sync with the portion of the video recorded. A group of university supervisors piloted a video annotation tool during student teaching to rate its effectiveness. Through a survey, the participants addressed how they perceived the implementation of the video annotation tool within the student teaching experience. Results suggest a video annotated technology-based supervision method is feasible and effective if paired with effective training and technical support.",

    "description": "This paper presents the findings of a three-cycle action research study (Nunan &amp; Bailey, 2009) that investigated the role of teaching presence (TP) in nurturing a Community of Inquiry (CoI) in a teacher training virtual exchange delivered in blended format. The study covers three iterations of such an exchange between three different cohorts of Polish and German EFL student teachers working on international teams to design technology-based intercultural tasks for their future educational contexts. Furthermore, we focus on the impact of TP on students' self- and co-regulatory learning accounted for in the newly emergent concept of learning presence (LP). Qualitative analysis of various data sets from the three research cycles reveals that students' LP, and with that their &quot;transformation of participation&quot; (Rogoff, 1994), is nurtured if instructors engage in various pedagogical interventions on the levels of design, discourse and instruction (Garrison, 2006). We identify the various types of such interventions and link them to different virtual exchange project phases. We also highlight the modelling role of TP in blended formats in the context of a teacher training virtual exchange. Modelling, delivered through such interventions, can be formative for future teachers' professional competence.",

    "author": "Fuchs, Carolin",
    "description": "This study explores critical incidents regarding differing cultures-of-use in telecollaboration against the backdrop of Hong Kong and German teacher education contexts. The rationale for the exchange was to model technology use and task design with the ultimate goal of internationalizing teacher education and supporting global citizenship. Participants in this project are 58 English majors in a graduate-level sociolinguistics course at a public research institution in Hong Kong and 15 EFL student teachers in a language teaching and new media elective course at a public education university in Germany. Using social media tools for interaction such as Facebook, Skype, WeChat, and WhatsApp, 11 telecollaborative teams engaged in three sequential tasks: (a) engaging in topical exchanges using Facebook, (b) writing a literature review in Google Docs, and (c) making recommendations on team websites using Wix. Research questions focus on critical incidents identified by participants during these tasks, particularly in relation to tool engagement. Data triangulation includes reflections, surveys, and online interactions. Findings indicate that the majority of Hong Kong teams cite low experience with certain tools, unfamiliarity with alternative tools (e.g., WeChat), and differences in tool access and use as constraints in achieving effective communication. Implications address sensitizing participants to their partners' tool socialization through implementing the critical incident technique.",

    "author": "Godwin-Jones, Robert",
    "description": "In the 20th anniversary issue of this journal, Reinders and White (2016) describe the relationship between computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and autonomy as having become &quot;both more complex and more promising&quot; (p. 143). This is, they assert, in large part due to the rise of informal language learning online, with an accompanying diminution for many learners in the role of formal education. In the process, they claim, education theory and practice have begun to take &quot;the learner's lives and their experience as a central point for their learning&quot; (p. 143). In this column, the author argues that this trend has accelerated, with new opportunities for autonomous language learning through mobile devices and the ever-increasing availability and use of streaming video and other authentic materials in the target language. The choice of learning resources is wide and personal, but inevitably draws the learner into contact--and into learning opportunities--with fellow learners and native speakers. While the principal focus is on language learning in the &quot;digital wilds,&quot; this article also considers how that process intersects with formal language instruction and how language teachers can facilitate out-of-school learning.",

    "description": "The research literature on L2 writing processes contains a multitude of insights that could inform writing instruction, but writing teachers are constrained in their capacity to make use of these insights insofar as they lack detailed information about how their students actually engage in the processes of writing. At the same time, writing-process researchers have been using powerful technologies that are potentially applicable in educational settings to trace writers' process engagement--namely, keystroke-logging and eye-tracking. In this article, we describe a pilot effort to integrate these technologies into L2 writing instruction with college-level ESL students. In addition to illustrating three key affordances of these technologies that emerged from the piloting, we discuss the conceptual framework that informed our efforts as well as challenges that will need to be addressed to facilitate further integration of process tracing into L2 writing pedagogy.",

    "author": "Lin, Jen-Jiun, Lin, Huifen",
    "description": "Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) has been a popular research area in recent years in the SLA field, as it has been considered as being able to facilitate language learning by offering an authentic, socially connective, contextually sensitive, and personalized mobile-mediated language learning environment. To investigate the benefits and possible limitations of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary retention, many researchers continuously conducted relevant experiments worldwide. Among the current mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning research, short message services (SMS), multimedia message service (MMS), and mobile applications (apps) are the predominant approaches supported by the situated learning theory, cognitive mechanisms of L2 word retention, behaviorism, and social constructivism. Although language educators have been focusing on this topic, the effectiveness of mobile L2 vocaubulary learning still remained inconclusive. Besides, to date, little research synthesis has been conducted to investigate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to systematically synthethisize findings from (quaisi-) experimental studies carried out between 2005 and 2018 to examine whether there is a connection between the use of mobile technologies and L2 word retention. The results of 33 primary eligible studies showed a positive and large effect of mobile-assisted L2 word learning interventions. Additionally, SMS/MMS mode was found to be more beneficial for L2 word retention than mobile application mode; however, it is more prudent to interpret this finding as tentative because the number of target words and intervention time were unequal in the two modes. Moreover, the research settings, treatment durations, and task-afforded autonomy are three variables that tend to significantly moderate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 word retention. However, the above results should be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive with a view to the research flaws found in the primary studies and the small sample size of certain categories of moderators when compared.",

The large population of English language learners (ELLs) has highlighted the need for educational technology as an important support for the different approaches to writing instruction for ELLs. In this meta-analysis, we examined the effectiveness of educational technology applications on the writing quality of adult ELLs. Twenty-one independent studies from 16 publications were included in this review. Our findings confirmed that technology applications produce a large effect size (0.93 and 1.28, fixed effect model and random effect model respectively) as compared to non-technology instructional methods.

    "description": "Despite its numerous benefits and potentialities for language learning and teaching, digital technology can also play a role in creating and maintaining inequality. While critical CALL often focuses on micro-level issues and contexts, macro-level perspectives, including discourses, are also essential to consider: From ecological and language-as-discourse perspectives, macro-level discourses have the potential to impact and shape CALL practices and contexts. Using critical discourse analysis methods, this article takes the 2017 American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) report, &quot;America's Languages: Investing in Language Education for the 21st Century,&quot; as a window into macro-level discourses of language and technology in American society today. Findings reveal a series of interrelated frames and scales that, taken together, suggest a neoliberal discourse that positioned language, technology, and ultimately CALL as tools to enhance national competitiveness on a global marketplace. The article concludes with implications of these findings for the CALL field.",

Conducting a multi-stage systematic review, we analyzed 52 scholarly research articles published between 2000 and 2016. Our findings indicate that while learners perceive linguistic benefits from interacting with different interlocutors in mainly blog- and wiki-mediated writing activities, they also report challenges with respect to task demands and the quality of feedback. Learners perceive CMC-integrated writing to be authentic and interactive, thereby developing their motivation, autonomy, and identity as writers. Finally, the implications of this review and the directions for future research in the domain of CMC and EFL/ESL writing are discussed.",

    "description": "The effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can have positive effects on the development of learners' English abilities. To what degree it is effective is partly determined by learners' characteristics in ICT use. However, these characteristics have not yet been sufficiently discussed in Japan. This study, then, explored how the characteristics of Japanese EFL university students related to their actual use of an online English course and whether it led to the development of their English abilities. In the survey, 130 Japanese university students were asked to self-evaluate their attitudes toward computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and the use of technology in an out-of-classroom situation. As a result, it became clear that most of the students were not confident in using the technology and did not use it actively outside the classroom. Cluster analysis was employed with a focus on individual differences, revealing that the time students actually spent on the course and their high evaluations of the effectiveness of CALL did not necessarily predict development of English abilities. It was suggested that individual differences should be carefully considered in adopting online English courses effectively in higher education institutions.",

    "author": "Blume, Carolyn",
    "description": "While digital gameplaying is increasingly recognized for its potential for language learning, its use among English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in both leisure and pedagogical contexts is comparatively meagre. Assumptions regarding the appropriate nature of schooling on the one hand and appropriate leisure pursuits on the other mediate beliefs about digital gaming to generate skepticism of gameplaying among many educators. Their devaluation of digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) has implications for language learning, not just in terms of skills and attitudes, but in regard to the development of linguistic capital. The purpose of this article is to use the concept of habitus to examine the reasons why educators marginalize DGBLL and the implications of such pedagogic decisions on the development of linguistic capital. Given the emergent empirical base, this contribution adopts a theoretical approach to contextualize observed trends. The article concludes by discussing the importance of teacher-mediated DGBLL for reasons of access and equity before recommending ways of integrating DGBLL to achieve these goals.",

Results revealed that there was no difference in answers in regards to impacting the constructs under investigation. However, there were other differences including higher word count and potentially more complex language usage when speaking to a human. Furthermore, students liked interacting with the system. These results suggest that the newly created system can assess students' English capabilities comparably to human interviewers and implementing such a formative assessment is feasible.",

    "description": "The present quasi-experimental study investigated the comparative effects of metalinguistic clue (MC) and metalinguistic explanation (ME) on the accurate use of Japanese transaction expressions. The study recruited 25 learners in a second-semester Japanese course (i.e. non-introduced group) and 17 students in a fourth-semester course (i.e. introduced group) at an American university. They worked on computer-delivered picture description practice with either type of feedback. Their production during the practice was analyzed in terms of successful uptake, and the test instrument consisted of timed oral production and untimed true/false judgment. The results from the uptake analysis indicated that the ME elicited significantly more successful uptake than the MC. However, multiple regression analyses showed that successful uptake was only marginally predictive of immediate performance on the timed oral production. In addition, a pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest demonstrated that the ME led to retention for the introduced group, while it did not for the non-introduced group. Meanwhile, the effects of the MC were not moderated by prior knowledge. The results were attributed to the different cognitive processing of feedback engendered from feedback type and prior knowledge.",

The findings showed that both written and video feedback was useful for English speaking skill development. Written feedback helped the students learn grammar rules and word usage to achieve greater linguistic accuracy in their English speaking performance. Video feedback helped students improve their intonation. However, neither video feedback nor written feedback could help them significantly improve their pronunciation and fluency. The students also preferred written over video feedback due to its efficiency and clarity.",

Drawing on ethnographic interviews (Spradley, 1979), during which the participants engaged in online English language activities (e.g., gaming, snapchatting, etc.), the study shows that most of the participants were motivated in their engagement with English by social and higher cognitive motives (Lompscher, 1999). They engaged substantially with affordances for language learning (i.e., deliberately chose English-language content over Danish), engaged in chats, and read and listened to online content. Some, on the other hand, were found to be motivated by lower cognitive motives, resulting in less engagement with the affordances. The study also found a substantial difference between perceptions of English in and outside school. The study adds new insights to an under-researched area, while giving voice to young users of English, as called for by Ushioda (2008, p. 29).",

Students in intermediate university-level French and Italian classes used Instagram for a six-week period to reply to a series of questions prompted by the instructor as a way to engage in interaction with their own classmates. This research examines how students establish a community of inquiry (CoI) and investigates the development of social presence in students' posts. Using a mixed methods approach, we performed a content analysis of the transcripts of Instagram posts, coding for social presence. Given the visual nature of Instagram, we also conducted a visual analysis of representative posts to investigate the multimodal projection of social presence. Additionally, we administered voluntary pre-questionnaires to capture demographic data and students' experience with Instagram. We analyzed the data using the social presence density calculation and performed basic statistical analyses. Findings indicate that students did build online social presence, which can promote the development of a CoI. Both language groups performed in similar ways, which may be a result of the tool rather than the language and context. This finding is consistent with the general use of visual social media as a tool for self-expression, self-identity, and community building.",

Drawing upon the conceptual framework of new literacy studies (Barton, 2007), we set four themes to present fans' literacy practices and language learning: (a) fan translation, (b) understanding the original text, (c) writing and preparing the translation, and (d) tools, resources, and collaborative online practices. Results indicated that the three informants encountered an open space for agency, creativity, and identity building and reinforcement through fan translation. Their translations provided content and represented the generators of the semiotic fabric in their fandoms (Gee, 2005).

    "description": "Linking research on task-based collaborative L2 writing and computer-mediated writing, this study investigates the relationship between patterns of collaboration and the linguistic features of texts written during a computer-supported collaborative writing task using Google Docs. Qualitative analyses provide insights into the writing process of successful collaborative groups. Twenty-eight first-year learners of German at a U.S. university participated in the study. Working in small groups, they completed a creative writing task, developing a hypothesized ending to a German feature film. The results suggest that collaboratively-oriented groups produced texts with more propositional content and better coherence than less-collaborative groups. These findings confirm previous observations that learner-to-learner engagement encourages meaning-making. They also expand existing research by connecting collaborative patterns to the quality of L2 output. Other linguistic features typically used for evaluating writing quality in task-based language learning research (i.e., grammatical or lexical accuracy, syntactic complexity, or lexical diversity) did not seem to be related to collaborative patterns. The article concludes with pedagogical and research insights into computer-supported collaborative writing among lower-proficiency L2 learners and the possibilities and limitations of Google Docs for analyzing data in such environments.",

    "description": "While research on informal digital learning of English (IDLE) increases in the fields of teaching English to speakers of other languages and computer-assisted language learning, few studies have examined the relationship between quantity and diversity of IDLE practices and different language learning outcomes. To address this gap, data were collected through one questionnaire, six English learning outcomes, and a semi-structured interview from 71 Korean English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) university students. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that IDLE Quantity, Age, and Major were significant predictors of two affective variables (Confidence and Enjoyment), while IDLE Diversity and Major were significantly predictive of productive language outcomes (Speaking and Productive Vocabulary Knowledge), scores in a standardized English test (TOEIC), and one affective variable (Lack of Anxiety). These results revealed how IDLE quantity and diversity can make a unique contribution to EFL learners' English outcomes.",

    "description": "This article reports on a study that examined the effectiveness of an intervention using text messages to enhance the academic vocabulary acquisition of English language learners (ELLs). With a random control trial design, we compared students' learning gain of target vocabulary (direct effect) and its subsequent impact on academic vocabulary learning (transfer effect) with and without the intervention treatment. The study included 108 undergraduate ELLs in a large Canadian university in Ontario. The intervention was aligned with the lesson plans of two comparable content-based courses on English for academic purposes required for the ELLs and aimed at teaching frequently used academic words embedded within the assigned course readings. The results indicated that, with the intervention, students learned significantly more target words. However, there was no difference between the treatment and control groups on academic vocabulary post-test performance measuring the transfer effect. The pedagogical implication of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

    "author": "Cunningham, D. Joseph",
    "description": "While many studies have documented the growth of second language abilities and intercultural knowledge as a result of participating in telecollaboration, research has not sufficiently investigated the development of content knowledge in this learning context. In response, this study explores content learning in a university-level, genre-based business German course. Two dyads and two triads of students conducted synchronous audiovisual interviews with Berlin-based entrepreneurs in order to expand upon their existing knowledge of German business culture. The study examines the extent to which L2 German learners were able to perform the genre 'oral interview' via synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and whether performance afforded learners the opportunity to: 1) display previously acquired content knowledge and 2) acquire new content knowledge. Discourse analysis of four hours of transcribed speech shows that all groups were able to navigate the generic stages of the oral interview. Furthermore, participants used both explicit and implicit means to refer to knowledge gained prior to the exchange and during the exchange. These results provide evidence that genre-based pedagogy can foster integrated content and language learning in SCMC-based telecollaboration by helping learners demonstrate attention, link existing knowledge to new knowledge, and create meaningful connections between different topical areas.",

We will present a new model of L2 learning interaction that is a schematic representation of two main types of hearer response that have been found after a trigger of nonunderstanding: Task-appropriate response (TAR) and face-appropriate response (FAR). In addition, we outline five different discourse trajectories. The model we propose is based on data derived from interactive task performances of groups of Dutch and Australian students in two telecollaboration projects. The discourse trajectories represented in our model provide us with useful insights into the complexities of digital interaction in an L2-learning environment and show that NNS-NS communication is more complex than traditional negotiation of meaning models suggest. We expect our model to contribute to a better understanding of L2 learning processes related to interaction in digital settings.",

    "description": "This study examines the linguistic resources by which foreign language (L2) learners express their ideological positions in online discussions taking place in a telecollaborative encounter during one semester. More specifically, the study attempts to decipher how L2 learners discuss and argue their points of view regarding their first culture, their second culture, and the topic in general, depending on the issue under discussion (immigration and nationalism or patriotism) and to the country where the learners were based (US or Spain). Twenty-four learners, organized into six groups, each with two students from the US and two from Spain, participated in three online forums. For the analysis, learners' postings were subjected to quantitative and qualitative content analysis applying two discourse-semantic subsystems of the Appraisal framework, Engagement--the linguistic resources used to reflect the writer's position and willingness to recognize alternative positions--and Attitude--the linguistic resources used to indicate positive or negative assessment of people, places, things, and states of affairs. This study concludes that there were clear differences in the discursive styles between both sets of learners and topics. Overall, for instance, the learners employed more monoglossic statements when discussing nationalism or patriotism rather than immigration and Spain-based learners made more use of judgment markers than their US-based counterparts did.",

    "description": "Although a number of studies have investigated study abroad or telecollaboration separately, none to date has included both methods with the aim of differentiating their impacts on the development of intercultural communicative competence (ICC). Using mixed methods, the current study compared foreign language learners' perceived ICC development under three different conditions over 6 weeks: 1) a study-abroad program (n = 52) in Korea, China, Japan, France, and Spain designed for American undergraduates; 2) telecollaboration (n = 54) between Korean students of English and American students of Korean; and 3) on-campus language study (n = 44) among Korean students of English and American students of Chinese who were learning languages at their home institutions. Data from 150 students were collected from pre- and post-study questionnaires measuring cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of ICC; reflective writing; exit essays; and interviews. The results indicated that the study abroad and telecollaboration groups exhibited significant improvement in perceived cognitive, affective (engagement and confidence), and behavioral aspects of ICC over time, whereas the on-campus (control) group showed little change in any aspect of ICC. Although the study-abroad group displayed significantly higher levels of intercultural knowledge than the telecollaboration group, both groups showed similar degrees of improvement in the affective and behavioral aspects of ICC. We argue that online interactions with members of the target culture can be as beneficial as studying abroad and that it is at least more beneficial than traditional classroom language learning in the development of L2 learners' perceived ICC.",

Originally directed at a target audience of young girls, MLP has become popular among men. These older male fans have been extremely active in producing multimodal and plurilingual fan practices. We explore how two different groups of bronies--one in Russia and the other in Spain--carry out fan practices in English. Applying digital ethnography, we describe six different cases of adult MLP fans. They both consume and create products such as fanfiction, translations, and fandubbing in different contexts with the use of sophisticated technologies. Not only do fandom practices allow these fans to develop digital identities and reach new audiences, they also help them to improve their English language skills--a task at which they reveal themselves to be both autonomous and self-critical. Regarding translation practices, we note several instances of bronies receiving mentoring from fellow fans who have a higher level of English. Finally, this article points out how, in the process of adapting their written output for global readerships, bronies can acquire some important transcultural skills.",

    "description": "Although studies using student response systems (SRSs) within the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom are relatively rare, there is increasing evidence from a range of disciplines to highlight the potential behind application of these systems for student learning. Consequently, this study contributes to filling this gap by demonstrating the efficacy of SRS-integration in the EFL reading classroom for formative assessment when supported by teacher-interaction and peer-interaction utilization techniques. Relying on a quasi-experimental design, results suggest that a Plickers SRS-integrated classroom can provide a digitally interactive learning environment and active learning opportunities, particularly when coupled with a peer-interaction technique. It also enhances Korean EFL learner engagement with content while supporting the development of reading comprehension skills. Further, findings indicate that learners are receptive to ongoing SRS utilization as an alternative to traditional methods, viewing it as useful for highlighting their knowledge gaps, focusing their attention, and stimulating their engagement.",

    "description": "With the ever-increasing number of available language technology products, there is also a need to evaluate them objectively. Unsubstantiated beliefs about what language technology can and cannot do inside or outside the language classroom often influence decisions about the choice of language technology to be used. The declarative/procedural model, which makes a clear distinction between the declarative and procedural memory systems, can help to provide an objective, neuroscience-informed evaluation of language technology. The central argument in this paper is that language technology caters predominantly to the declarative memory system. This system is very effective in forming explicit metalinguistic knowledge but does not lead to automatic production or procedural ability. For technology to promote procedural ability, it should instead cater to the procedural memory, which involves the implicit neurofunctional computational system. This paper provides a language technology evaluation flowchart to help professionals evaluate the language technology products they will use and gauge their expectations of those products more realistically. It also provides a list of factors to be taken into account in maximizing the benefits of technology.",

To this aim, we have developed an ad hoc application that allows us to establish a set of filters and techniques that successfully control dropout and non-serious test takers, two of the main threats of low-stakes testing. A total of 2,095 sessions has been registered. The obtained results show that age and knowledge level influences the execution of the test, whereas gender does not. Moreover, it is made explicit that conducting the test in an unproctored manner redounds to the achievement of better results. Finally, even if the time needed to complete the test is comparable in both cases, it is better invested in the unproctored version, i.e. less time is devoted to easy questions and more time is devoted to difficult questions if compared to the proctored version. These results seem to indicate that the unproctored version measures better the knowledge level for language low-stakes tests because they are carried out in an environment that is familiar to the examinee, and they lack the pressure of proctored testing.",

    "description": "How can we identify authentic reading material that matches the learner's proficiency and fosters their language development? Traditionally, this involves assigning a one-dimensional label to the text that identifies the grade or proficiency level of the learners that the text is intended for. Such an approach is inadequate given that both the text complexity and proficiency constructs are multi-dimensional in nature. We propose to instead link readers and texts through multidimensional vectors characterizing the linguistic complexity of the reading material and that of texts written by the learners as proxy of their proficiency level. We first validate the approach using a leveled reading corpus by showing that vector distances computed on the complexity representations can serve the function of the traditional labels. We then highlight the advantage of the multi-dimensional approach using data from a continuation writing task, showing that it makes it possible to study individual complexity dimensions and to explore different degrees of challenge for different dimensions. Our approach essentially makes it possible to empirically investigate the +1 of Krashen's i+1, the challenge that best fosters development given the learner's interlanguage. On the practical side, we discuss an ICALL system demonstrating the viabilityof the approach in real-life..",

Thus, we observed significantly improved learning outcomes in the experimental group relative to the control groups in both total score and vocabulary part of the post-test. However, tests carried out for learning different kinds of vocabulary based on CTPR were also analyzed, and the results showed no significant difference between verbs, nouns or adjectives. This experiment revealed that this system would possibly be helpful for English learning regardless of the kind of vocabulary targeted. Therefore, we concluded that CTPR is not only more helpful for English learning than the traditional individual TPR but also worth being employed and requires further exploration in facilitating English learning.",

Our focus on the pedagogical use of music results from the reported benefits that it offers language learners (e.g., it encourages repetitive exposure to the L2 in an enjoyable way, it extends the reach of the language classroom). In addition, &quot;Bande \u00e0 Part&quot; has the potential to contribute to this under-researched area of L2 French pedagogy (Engh, 2013). The development of the app adopted current SLA theory and principles such as those set forth by Doughty and Long (2003). Some of these principles suggest that technology can help learners through input enhancements (e.g. grammatical gender highlighting, subtitles and translations) and grading content for proficiency level, particularly if offered in a mobile environment to foster &quot;anywhere, anytime&quot; learning (e.g., Stockwell, 2010). This paper introduces &quot;Bande \u00e0 Part&quot; and the rationale for its development, including how Doughty and Long' (2003) principles were used to promote L2 learning in a mobile-assisted environment. Lastly, the current lyrical corpus is evaluated for vocabulary coverage in order to highlight the app's strengths and weaknesses according to this criterion.",

A key barrier I identify in this regard is media users' increasing ability to filter what they want to see and hear.

    "description": "From its beginnings, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has been widely seen as an enterprise that draws on inputs from multiple disciplines. Scholars tracking the development of such enterprises in other domains have developed generally accepted terminology distinguishing concepts of multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and transdisciplinarity along a continuum from lesser to greater integration, coherence, and synthesis. We begin with an overview of the three preceding concepts with particular attention to interdisciplinarity in contemporary CALL. We then explore the notion of transdisciplinarity as an emerging theme in applied linguistics, arguably the field most closely related to CALL. In the following section, we look at theoretical options that are less connected to single disciplinary positions and represent the interdisciplinary state of the field and its movement toward transdisciplinarity. We expand on the basic notion of CALL as a potential transdisciplinary field and provide a descriptive framework of transdisciplinary types. The final section offers a model for visualizing transdisciplinarity for CALL with accompanying examples, arguing for a set of common transdisciplinary notions and a lingua franca for CALL stakeholders from a range of disciplines to use when communicating. We conclude that the future of the field lies in a much stronger transdisciplinary orientation than is currently the case and call upon our colleagues to pursue the concept.",

The participants were students in two classes of eighth graders from a junior high school in Singapore, and the study lasted for 5 weeks. A quasiexperimental design was adopted by randomly assigning the two classes to the experimental group (N=26) or the control group (N = 34). The two groups received identical writing instructions and were asked to write essays about identical topics within an identical time period. The only difference between the two groups was the activities performed at the prewriting stage: with or without immersive exploration in SL. Three kinds of qualitative data were collected and analyzed: students' writing plans, students' compositions, and in-class observation data. The analysis results show that the writing motivation and performance of the CSL students varied depending on whether or not they performed immersive exploration before writing. Those who explored the authentic contexts in SL before writing performed significantly better at constructing a prewriting plan and exhibited significantly higher writing quality compared to those without such an immersive experience. The former group also demonstrated higher motivation.",

While the rising cost of textbooks is a concern in higher education, over 50% of the surveyed educators stated that they are unaware of the OER and how they could replace the traditional textbooks. In addition, not many instructors understand the Creative Commons licenses under which OER can be used. In this work, we consider the types of OER and outline the sources of OER for business courses. We describe our experience of using such resources for innovative business courses and discuss the choices we made and the lessons learned. Finally, we share the results of surveys about OER we conducted with students and reflect on them.",

The present study examined Pinterest content sharing as a proxy for interest among school personnel. Using Hall, Breeden, and Giacobe's coding scheme, 657 pins from 499 randomly selected pinners following the National Association of School Psychologists' Pinterest account were coded by content area and assessed for level of evidence base. Significant associations were found in chi-square analyses between category of internalizing disorders, evidence base, and types of pins shared. In addition, the category of internalizing disorder and level of evidence base were found to have a significant interaction with the ease of implementation. Assessing the content shared on Pinterest may inform future evidence-based implementation difficulties in schools.",

    "description": "Captions provide a useful aid to language learners for comprehending videos and learning new vocabulary, aligning with theories of multimedia learning. Multimedia learning predicts that a learner's working memory (WM) influences the usefulness of captions. In this study, we present two eye-tracking experiments investigating the role of WM in captioned video viewing behavior and comprehension. In Experiment 1, Spanish-as-a-foreign-language learners differed in caption use according to their level of comprehension and to a lesser extent, their WM capacities. WM did not impact comprehension. In Experiment 2, English-as-a-second-language learners differed in comprehension according to their WM capacities. Those with high comprehension and high WM used captions less on a second viewing. These findings highlight the effects of potential individual differences and have implications for the integration of multimedia with captions in instructed language learning. We discuss how captions may help neutralize some of working memory's limiting effects on learning.",

One control group and three experimental groups were formed by 132 intermediate language learners. Pre- and post-tests of productive recall and multiple-choice productive recognition were administered, and learners' perceptions toward glossing were examined through a questionnaire and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using ANCOVA, and themes that emerged from the qualitative data were identified. The quantitative findings revealed that dual glossing modes were more effective than single glossing modes for many test sessions. However, single glossing was also effective for a few test sessions. The questionnaire and interview data showed that learners preferred the dual glossing mode of L2 definition and video animation. The findings provide insights for vocabulary learning and teaching.",

    "description": "The purposes of this study are to examine the relation between playing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games in the wild and L2 English vocabulary and to offer comparisons with non-gamers' vocabulary. Data were collected from two samples of teenage L2 English learners in Sweden, Sample A (N = 1,069) and Sample B (N = 16). Questionnaires and English grades were collected from A and B, productive and receptive vocabulary tests from A, and interviews and essays from B. A quantitative-dominant mixed-methods approach was adopted. Results showed a significant positive correlation between time played and test scores. They also showed that time played was related to types of games played. Multiple regression analysis including time played and types of games as predictor variables and L2 vocabulary as the outcome variable showed that the effect from type disappeared when it was entered into the model, whereas time remained significant. A close examination of 45 words (productive test) revealed significantly higher scores for gamers (compared with non-gamers) at all vocabulary frequency levels, and for particularly difficult words. Overall, findings from Sample B regarding gaming habits and vocabulary (i.e., use of advanced or infrequent words in essays) reflected the results from Sample A, making it possible to conclude that playing COTS games matters for L2 learner vocabulary.",

These groups completed writing tasks before the drills, immediately after the drills, and two weeks after the drills. In the drills, the feedback groups completed an untimed error correction test (ECT 1) in which they received either metalinguistic feedback or metalinguistic feedback with corrections. After that, the feedback groups completed another untimed ECT (ECT 2). The no-feedback group completed the two ECTs without receiving any feedback. The results showed that the feedback groups performed better than the no-feedback group on ECT 2. However, no effect for group was found on the learners' improvement from the first to the second writing task and from the first to the third writing task.",

We are now seeing powerful artificial neural networks with impressive language capabilities. In education, data provides means to track learner performance and improve learning, especially through the application of data mining to expose hidden patterns of learner behavior. Massive data collection also raises issues of transparency and fairness. Human monitoring is essential in applying data analysis equitably. Big data may have as powerful an impact in language learning as it is having in society generally; it is an important resource to have available, but one to use with care and caution.",

Students in an advanced-level Russian course used a Makerspace to complete a three-part project aimed at language and cultural learning through art and presentational speaking. Participants completed a survey about their experience at the end of the project, thus providing some data by which to assess its success. Students used Oculus Rift headsets to view 360-degree target-culture images and engaged in a hands-on sculpting activity that resulted in printing 3D models. Learners also used iPads for a painting activity, which was then compared with the VR sculpting task. The survey results showed that the Makerspace, and using VR in particular, was a success. Positive outcomes included facilitating task motivation, fostering speaking and artistic creativity, enabling deeper learning and focus on the task, assisting with cultural development, and enjoying learning by doing/making. Suggestions for future Makerspace projects in language labs are discussed.",

This study investigated English vocabulary learning from engagement with mobile-based word cards and paper word cards in the context of the Chinese university classroom. A total of 85 undergraduate students were recruited to take part in the study. The students were divided into two groups, a mobile learning group and a paper-based learning group, and tested on two word knowledge components: receptive knowledge of the form-meaning connection and productive knowledge of collocations. Both the digital and non-digital word cards enhanced L2 vocabulary learning, and the results showed that the mobile application (app) promoted greater gains than physical word cards.",

    "author": "Lee, Sangmin-Michelle",
    "description": "The use of machine translation (MT) in the academic context has increased in recent years. Hence, language teachers have found it difficult to ignore MT, which has led to some concerns. Among the concerns, its accuracy has become a major factor that shapes language teachers' pedagogical decision to use MT in their language classrooms. Despite the urgency of the issue, studies on MT output quality in foreign language education remain scarce. Moreover, as MT is advancing every year, updated studies are imperative. Therefore, the present study investigated the quality of MT outputs (Google Translate) from Korean to English by comparing it with the English-translated texts of intermediate English as a foreign language students. The study also examined the factors within the source texts that affect the quality of MT outputs. Five trained evaluators examined multiple aspects of MT output samples (N = 104) and students' English texts (N = 104), including mechanics, vocabulary, grammar, and context. The results showed that both texts were equally comprehensible, but MT outperformed the students in most aspects under investigation. The study further found that only two factors in the source texts -- punctuation and sentence complexity -- influenced MT output quality, whereas lexical and grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, and contextual understanding did not affect it. Based on the results, the study presents classroom implications for using MT for educational purposes.",

The project was conducted as part of an English language course for undergraduate students majoring in English in the context of a higher education institution in Hong Kong. Data were collected through multiple methods: survey questionnaires, open-ended questions, and face-to-face interviews. The results showed that the video production mode of presentation could not only replace traditional in-class presentation but also improve students' learning autonomy, and language, collaborative, and digital literacy skills. The analysis of videos elucidated how the video production (VPR) group of students use multimodal semiotic resources to design their relationships with viewers while simultaneously adapting their discoursal identities. In addition, the comparison between VPR- and non-VPR-group presentations demonstrates that constructing audio-visual resources in a collaborative environment contributes to a variety of aspects to a higher extent. Implications for foreign language curriculum and instructional design, as well as recommendations for future studies of digitalization of students' oral assessment tasks, are discussed.",

This study introduced a task-based voice chatbot called &quot;Ellie&quot;, newly developed by the researchers, and examined the appropriateness of its task design and performance as an English conversation partner and students' perceptions on using it in EFL class. Korean EFL learners (N = 314) aged 10-15 years performed three speaking tasks with Ellie in their school classroom. The participants took 9.63 turns per session on average using the first 1,000-word band, indicating that the chatbot highly encouraged students to engage in conversation, which rarely occurs in general EFL classes in Korea. The high task success rates (88.3%) showed the design appropriateness of both L2 tasks and operational intents in terms of users' successful understanding and completeness of the given chatbot tasks. The participants' responses to the survey not only supported the positive potential of the chatbot in EFL settings but also revealed limitations to be resolved. Future suggestions for advancing and implementing AI chatbots in EFL classrooms are discussed.",

The telecollaboration was a pedagogical intervention in which the US participants taught grammar to their non-native-speaker peers. Specifically, the study aimed to trace pre-service teachers' grammar instruction techniques applied in the communication-oriented context of online exchanges and responses to this instruction, the grammar forms attended to in the exchanges, and the participants' evaluations of the usefulness of telecollaboration for teaching and learning grammar. Utilizing data from the participants' emails and results of a post-project survey, this mixed methods study reveals that (1) the implicit technique of modeling was the most frequently applied; (2) the grammatical forms used in both implicit and explicit teaching reflected the communicative orientation of the exchanges; (3) the levels of uptake (i.e. attempts to follow the models provided in the input), and the forms attended to by the learners, reflected their proficiency levels and linguistic background; and (4) participants reported positive opinions about the value of telecollaboration in grammar instruction and in teacher training. The data thus underscore the benefits of online exchanges in giving prospective teachers hands-on experience with communicative grammar teaching.",

Adopting a mixed-methods research approach, this study focuses on examining the pedagogical benefits of a Chinese-American virtual exchange as mediated by students' self-reported data. Two Chinese language classes (i.e. one at the elementary level and one at the intermediate level) at a small liberal arts college in the United States and a group of Chinese-speaking English majors at a Chinese university in Shanghai participated in the exchange. Analyses of four sources of qualitative data (i.e. WeChat group cultural discussion transcripts, Skype conversations, reflection journals, and end-of-program interviews) gave rise to four benefits of the exchange: promotion of cultural learning, improvement of Chinese language skills, enhancement of learning motivation, and establishment of a language learning community. Quantitative analyses of the end-of-semester questionnaire items show that the benefit regarding cultural learning, on average, received the highest rating, followed by community building and motivation enhancement, with improvement of Chinese skills being rated the lowest. Moreover, intermediate-level students evaluated all four benefits with higher ratings than elementary-level students. In particular, the two groups' quantitative evaluations in terms of Chinese skills and motivation differed significantly. However, both groups enthusiastically endorsed the benefits of cultural learning and community building. The pedagogical implications of these results are also discussed.",

    "description": "Owing to the anytime-anywhere-anyhow nature of mobile learning, together with the ubiquity of affordably priced mobile phones, learning has become a mobigital practice, as termed by Sad and G\u00f6ktas (2014). Consequently, language teaching/learning is gradually shifting from computer-assisted language learning to mobile-assisted language learning (MALL). In response, the current study examined the impact of MALL training on preservice and in-service EFL teachers' perceptions and use of mobile technology (MT). For this purpose, two groups of preservice (N = 33) and in-service (N = 31) EFL teachers were randomly selected and exposed to MALL training. The pretest-posttest experimental mixed-methods design was used as a framework for collecting and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data (using closed- and open-ended-question surveys). Quantitative results revealed that both preservice and in-service teachers had similar perceptions of MT before and after training. The only exception is that, after training, in-service teachers were more interested in MT than preservice teachers. However, both groups demonstrated an overall (and subfactor) improvement in their perceptions after MT training, except for their perceived ease of use. In-service teachers' use also improved after training and, due to the yielded positive correlation, their perceptions were a significant predictor of use.

Moreover, they regarded technical and digital literacy problems as the ones most challenging to the use of MT.",

    "author": "Burston, Jack, Giannakou, Konstantinos",
    "description": "The aim of this study is to comprehensively evaluate quantitative experimental mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) studies published between 1994 and 2019 that meet minimal conditions of research design and statistical analysis. Starting with a bibliographical database of 1,144 references to experimental MALL implementations, of which there were 700 objectively substantiated by quantitative experimental language learning outcomes, only 84 experimental MALL studies met the inclusion requirements. Their analysis addresses two critical sets of research questions. First, what are the general characteristics of the selected studies and, second, what are their language learning outcomes in terms of measured effect size. Nine general characteristics are considered: publication source, chronological distribution, country of origin, institutional environment, sample size, intervention duration, targeted language, language learner competence level, and learning focus. Effect size was calculated separately for between-group (independent, experimental) and within-group (quasi-experimental) treatment studies. In both cases, the overall results were quite large: 0.72 for the former and 1.16 for the latter. An analysis of four critical moderator variables (language learner competence level, language area focus, institutional environment, and intervention duration) revealed similarly large effect sizes. Notwithstanding, analysis of the data also confirmed obvious publication bias and a very high level of heterogeneity that frequently approached 100%. The relevance of positive language learning outcome conclusions thus needs to be tempered by these shortcomings.",

    "title": "An Editable Learner Model for Text Recommendation for Language Learning",
    "author": "Lee, John S. Y.",
    "description": "Extracurricular reading is important for learning foreign languages. Text recommendation systems typically classify users and documents into levels, and then match users with documents at the same level. Although this approach can be effective, it has two significant shortcomings. First, the levels assume a standard order of language acquisition and cannot be personalized to the users' learning patterns. Second, recommendation decisions are not transparent because the leveling algorithms can be difficult for users to interpret. We propose a novel method for text recommendation that addresses these two issues. To enhance personalization, an open, editable learner model estimates user knowledge of each word in the foreign language. The documents are ranked by new-word density (NWD) -- that is, the percentage of words that are new to the user in the document. The system then recommends documents according to a user-specified target NWD. This design offers complete transparency as users can scrutinize recommendations by reviewing the NWD estimation of the learner model. This article describes an implementation of this method in a mobile app for learners of Chinese as a foreign language. Evaluation results show that users were able to manipulate the learner model and NWD parameters to adjust the difficulty of the recommended documents. In a survey, users reported satisfaction with both the concept and implementation of this text recommendation method.",

    "description": "Drawing on existing research with a holistic stance toward multimodal meaning-making, this paper takes an analytic approach to integrating eye-tracking data to study the perception and use of multimodality by teachers and learners. To illustrate this approach, we analyse two webconference tutoring sessions from a telecollaborative project involving pre-service teachers and learners of Mandarin Chinese. The tutoring sessions were recorded and transcribed multimodally, and our analysis of two types of conversational side sequences shows that the integration of eye-tracking data into an ecological approach provides richer results. Specifically, our proposed approach provided a window on the participants' cognitive management of graphic and visual affordances during interaction and uncovered episodes of joint attention.",

Based on an analysis of previous work and semi-structured interviews with L2 learners and teachers, recommendations for robot-led conversation practice for adult learners at intermediate level are first defined, focused on language learning, on the social context, on the conversational structure and on verbal and visual aspects of the robot moderation. Guided by these recommendations, an experiment is set up, in which 12 pairs of L2 learners of Swedish interact with a robot in short social conversations. These robot-learner interactions are evaluated through post-session interviews with the learners, teachers' ratings of the robot's behaviour and analyses of the video-recorded conversations, resulting in a set of guidelines for robot-led conversation practice: (1) societal and personal topics increase the practice's meaningfulness for learners; (2) strategies and methods for providing corrective feedback during conversation practice need to be explored further; (3) learners should be encouraged to support each other if the robot has difficulties adapting to their linguistic level; (4) the robot should establish a social relationship by contributing with its own story, remembering the participants' input, and making use of non-verbal communication signals; and (5) improvements are required regarding naturalness and intelligibility of text-to-speech synthesis, in particular its speed, if it is to be used for conversations with L2 learners.",

    "description": "Virtual exchange (VE) is an umbrella term used to refer to the engagement of groups of students in sustained online intercultural interaction and collaboration with international partners under the guidance of their teachers. In the computer-assisted language learning literature, telecollaboration and eTandem approaches to VE have been researched extensively. However, this research has principally focused to date on learner gains and the impact on teachers has been much less explored. This paper identifies the impact of VE on foreign language teachers' practices and their professional development by examining the results of a qualitative study of 31 teacher trainers who engaged their classes in VE projects as part of a large-scale European project. The findings of the study suggest that participation in VE projects provides teachers with valuable experience in continued professional development and methodological innovation. In particular, VE was seen to open up opportunities for teachers to develop new professional partnerships, collaborative academic initiatives, to develop their own online collaboration skills, and also to introduce more innovative approaches in their current teaching practice.",

For so doing, a qualitative case study was carried out to explore how project-based learning (PBL) contributes to six in-service teachers' CALL PD. Drawing on data obtained from technology-review projects and follow-up discussions, it was observed that the experience of review, reflection, and discussion enhanced participants' technological knowledge, along with their attention to the affordances and constraints of different tools, their application for materials development or selection, and CALL evaluation. The potential contribution of this study to PD research lies in the account of how inquiry-oriented projects can be defined into the design of a CALL PD.

    "description": "Participation in online courses has become essential for training language professionals in under-resourced contexts with skills in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) (Godwin-Jones, 2014). Most online CALL courses use asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) to facilitate meaningful learning for participants. Although participants' sustained engagement with ACMC is the target, global realities of participants interfere with their participation levels. This article investigates participants' engagement profiles in asynchronous online discussions in an 8-week CALL-based global online course developed and implemented by a team at Iowa State University. Using a case study approach, nine focal participants' engagement profiles have been analyzed in terms of identifying patterns of engagement in the discussion posts and their relation to the types of discussion prompts. Then, social network analysis (SNA) and thematic analysis were employed to investigate patterns of interaction among the participants in the replies. The results indicated that engagement patterns observed in discussion posts overall aligned with the primary goals of prompt types. SNA further identified two participants as social mediators to connect participants with each other. These findings are significant in that they suggest the effectiveness of using ACMC to promote co-construction of knowledge for a global audience. This article also provides implications regarding the design of discussion prompts to help maximize participant engagement with course content.",

Eleven adult English learners in China and four native-speaking English instructors participated in a series of learning activities at an arboretum on the campus of a university in the US. Based on the analysis of surveys, interviews, field notes, and learning activity videos, the findings show that using telepresence robots outside the classroom provides unique learning affordance for learners, especially when proper design principles are followed in designing the learning activities.",

    "author": "Cucchiarini, Catia, Hubers, Ferdy, Strik, Helmer",
    "description": "Idiomatic expressions like &quot;hit the road&quot; or &quot;turn the tables&quot; are known to be problematic for L2 learners, but research indicates that learning L2 idiomatic language is important. Relatively few studies, most of them focusing on English idioms, have investigated how L2 idioms are actually acquired and how this process is affected by important idiom properties like transparency (the degree to which the figurative meaning of an idiom can be inferred from its literal analysis) and cross-language overlap (the degree to which L2 idioms correspond to L1 idioms). The present study employed a specially designed CALL system to investigate the effects of intensity of practice and the reading modality on learning Dutch L2 idioms, as well as the impact of idiom transparency and cross-language overlap. The results show that CALL practice with a focus on meaning and form is effective for learning L2 idioms and that the degree of practice needed depends on the properties of the idioms. L2 learners can achieve or even exceed native-like performance. Practicing reading idioms aloud does not lead to significantly higher performance than reading idioms silently. These findings have theoretical implications as they show that differences between native speakers and L2 learners are due to differences in exposure, rather than to different underlying acquisition mechanisms. For teaching practice, this study indicates that a properly designed CALL system is an effective and an ecologically sound environment for learning L2 idioms, a generally unattended area in L2 classes, and that teaching priorities should be based on degree of transparency and cross-language overlap of L2 idioms.",

The results showed that participants use their smartphones more frequently to engage in English listening and speaking activities than reading and writing activities. The participants also believe that smartphones scarcely have adverse effects on learning English. However, it was also found that the more time students spend online, the more they suffer from the adverse effects of smartphones in terms of language learning. Results about gender revealed that female students use their smartphones more frequently than their male peers to engage in formal language learning activities. Significant differences related to frequency of smartphone use for both formal and informal language learning purposes were detected, with the Business Administration and Molecular Biology and Genetics department students showing higher frequency. No statistically significant difference was found between students' views about using smartphones for language learning according to the types of Internet connection (Wi-Fi, mobile data, or both).",

The participants were required to work in small groups to create their digital stories in the target language, English, under an eight-week interdisciplinary curriculum. A two-group quasi-experiment with a pretest and posttest design was then conducted to compare the participants' learning outcomes. The findings reveal the authentic and meaningful learning opportunities that DST has to offer for effectively fostering the students' development of becoming proficient English speakers and creative thinkers. Future implementations on interdisciplinary DST projects are thus recommended for educators.",

    "description": "Learning analytics (LA) has the potential to generate new insights into the complexities of learning behaviours in language massive open online courses (LMOOCs). In LA, the collective attention model takes an ecological system view of the dynamic process of unequal participation patterns in online and flexible learning environments. In this study, the 'Oral Communication for EFL Learners (spring)' on XuetangX was selected as an example with which to examine the allocation of learner attention in the context of LMOOCs. The open-flow network of collective attention was used to model the dynamics of learning behaviours to understand how different cohorts of second language (L2) learners allocated their attention at the collective level. The results showed that what distinguished high-performing L2 learners was related less to where they started with LMOOC resources or how much attention they allocated to certain learning units and more to the extent to which their attention could be maintained and circulated into other learning units. In addition, learners' attention typically followed the pre-designed course structure each time they entered the online space. No learning resources offered in the selected LMOOC were found to dominate the collective attention flow, which suggested that L2 learners' online engagement followed classroom learning patterns. The use of LA to understand the allocation of L2 attention at the collective level provides new perspectives on digital behaviour in LMOOCs, which may facilitate the design of cost-effective L2 resources that prevent learner overload in the information-rich age.",

There is clarification of how virtual classroom systems operate, followed by a discussion of the benefits of learning in these environments. Private corporations are capitalizing on OLL and generating an estimated global gross income of 86 billion USD. While these corporations likely create quality educational materials that are of interest to the student, the materials presented in these platforms are currently not regulated, and, while some companies follow CEFR guidelines, there is no guarantee whether they meet the standards of education boards in the public sector. We surveyed 35 OLL teachers who teach English in virtual classrooms for their perceptions and opinions in working in this environment. Not only did we discover that over 50 percent of the online teachers who participated have also been students, which is of interest because they have both teaching and learning experience in virtual classrooms, but also that these teachers generally believe that teaching English online in virtual classrooms creates a positive teaching environment for both the teacher and the student. The participants generally feel they get to know the students better in virtual classrooms than in other teaching environments. The teachers also perceive that students in virtual classrooms learn at the same rate or faster than in traditional classrooms and that, not only would they like to see more subjects offered online, but they also generally believe that online learning in virtual classrooms may be an alternative learning method to replace traditional classroom learning and home-schooling in most subjects. Continued attention should be paid to the educational opportunities in virtual classrooms, not just for OLL, but for the emergence of other curricula as well.",

The results of the study indicate that normalisation is occurring to some extent within the setting, with the degree of normalisation significantly affected by both contextual factors and the way the teaching community operates. The study also suggests that normalisation itself should be viewed as a more complex, dynamic, context-dependent and community-based concept than previously recognised. This study may therefore be of interest to policy makers, school administrators and teachers working towards incorporating and normalising technology in teaching and learning.",

    "description": "The issues of whether mobile-assisted English as a foreign language (EFL) reading is effective have become increasingly important for EFL teachers and policy-makers. However, empirical studies investigating EFL students' reading comprehension performance on mobile phones and students' perceptions of these reading formats are lacking. The present research employed questionnaire surveys and semistructured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading in terms of participants' reading comprehension accuracy, reading speed, and reading strategy used (i.e. general, problem-solving or support strategies) and explore EFL learners' perceptions of mobile-assisted EFL reading. A sample of 81 first-year college students participated in a quasiexperiment, 6 participants participated in a semistructured interview, and a sample of an additional 10 students participated in a pilot study. The analyses, including qualitative descriptions, mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired-sample t-tests, and independent-sample t-tests, indicated that participants achieved superior reading comprehension accuracy when reading from printed paper compared to reading from mobile phones. Superior reading speed from paper was observed only when participants were instructed to read and complete the comprehension test the first time, while no difference in speed between the two reading media was observed the second time. Additionally, participants' use of reading strategies during mobile-assisted EFL reading was not as effective as that during paper reading. Regarding participants' preferences, most participants (79%) preferred reading from paper over mobile phones because hard copies provided a better reading experience and promoted active reading engagement. However, participants held positive attitudes toward mobile-assisted EFL learning and wanted to continue to read from mobile phones to assist their foreign language learning due to their convenient built-in functions and portability. The implications for the use of mobile devices to assist language pedagogical practice are discussed.",

The present study examined studies published between 2000 and 2018 to understand the trends of technology and related research and the current issues with context-aware technology in FL learning. This review included 75 empirical studies and 13 system-descriptive studies. The empirical studies were further examined in terms of publication year, methodology, participants, languages, device types, and the effectiveness of the technology based on FL learning results. Most of the studies indicated positive effects of the technology in the affective, linguistic, socio-cultural, and cognitive domains. The review also found issues with the reviewed studies, including the research methods, research sustainability, and practicability of the technology. The review results showed that the number of publications per year fluctuated rather than increased over the studied period. Students' perceptions of the use of context-aware technology in FL were the most common focus of the reviewed research; far fewer empirical studies were found that assessed students' actual language learning outcomes. The results of this study suggest that more long-term, pedagogy-informed empirical studies based on students' actual learning outcomes are required to verify the effectiveness of context-aware technology on FL learning and to help effectively integrate such technology into learning in the future.",

    "author": "Garc\u00eda-G\u00f3mez, Antonio",
    "description": "By using small focus group discussions, the present study aims to gain insight into students' perceptions about the impact of WhatsApp use in their learning process. More specifically, this study presents a cross-cultural analysis of British and Spanish university students' personal beliefs about the effectiveness of using WhatsApp to complete group tasks outside the classroom. In so doing, this research represents a step forward in technology-enhanced instruction insofar as it not only incorporates the voices of learners themselves, but also contrasts students' beliefs with their group interactions on WhatsApp. The exploration of these WhatsApp interactions makes it possible to argue that the use of WhatsApp does not seem to create a natural context for non-native language users to produce contextualise relevant utterances while interacting with native English speakers. Furthermore, the results show that the lack of pragmatic competence on the part of the participants prevents them from communicating effectively. These pragmatic failures, in turn, have a negative impact on their interpersonal relationships and make them develop negative opinions towards the use of WhatsApp as a learning tool.",

The research design involved a 2 (advance-organizer strategy: present vs. absent) \u00d7 4 (caption type: glossed full captions, glossed keyword captions, full captions, keyword captions) between-subjects design. A total of 240 Chinese ESL primary school students were recruited and randomly and equally assigned to eight conditions. Findings revealed that captioned videos produced significant effects on learning regarding the three dimensions of vocabulary knowledge. Glossed full captions were found to be the most effective caption type. Administration of the advance-organizer strategy also resulted in better gains in learning form, meaning, and use than the absence of this strategy. The combination of the advance-organizer strategy and glossed full captions led to the best learning performance for each dimension of vocabulary knowledge. Relevant pedagogical implications, including use of the advance-organizer strategy and captions, are provided.",

    "description": "This study applied Edmodo as a supplementary environment for additional language practice in a semi-technical English course in an EFL context, with a quasi-experimental between-subjects (control versus experimental group) design. In addition to conventional classroom instruction and practice, the experimental group practiced additional language exercises using Edmodo application while the control group participants worked on similar exercises during extended classroom meetings. The results of paired and independent sample t-tests conducted on both groups' using 48-item, multiple-choice (vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension) pre and posttests revealed that while both groups demonstrated a statistically significant performance in the achievement posttest which was administered at the end of the course, the performance of the experimental group was significantly better than the control. The findings suggest that Edmodo is a valuable and cost-effective tool for language learning/practice beyond the physical and temporal confinements of conventional language classrooms.",

This study implemented an AR-enhanced theme-based contextualized learning and aimed to examine the effects of captions (non-caption, English caption and Chinese caption) and English proficiency (less proficient and proficient) on junior high school students' English learning effectiveness, motivation and attitude. Six classes of ninth-graders voluntarily participated in the experimental learning sessions using tablets. A factorial design was employed, and the participants' learning performance, motivation and attitude were evaluated. The results indicated that captions did not affect knowledge comprehension, but English proficiency played a significant role in it. The effects of captions and English proficiency on knowledge application indicated that English captions placed high cognitive load and hindered less proficient learners' knowledge application, but proficient learners performed equally under different caption conditions. Generally, students demonstrated positive motivation toward learning from the AR-enhanced contextualized learning. The proficient learners were more motivated in terms of self-efficacy, proactive learning and learning value. All learners expressed positive attitude toward learning, among whom, those who learned without captions showed greater degrees of confidence and preferences, and the proficient learners showed greater degrees of confidence, preferences, learning process and learning strategy but lower degrees of anxiety.",

In so doing, two intact classes were selected from an Iranian university as the participants of the study and they were randomly assigned as the control and experimental groups with 24 and 27 EFL students respectively. Over a period of one semester, the control group (the non-flipped classroom) was taught using traditional writing instruction whereas the experimental group (the flipped classroom) was taught in a flipped learning mode. The students' performance on two timed writing tasks was examined in terms of global writing performance and writing CAF. Paired samples t-tests, one-way ANCOVA, Mann Whitney U, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to analyse the data. The results demonstrated that the flipped classroom significantly developed and outperformed the non-flipped classroom on EFL students' global writing performance and writing fluency; however, its effect on the students' writing complexity and accuracy fell short of significance. Based on the findings, implications are provided for EFL writing instruction.",

    "title": "Using Spoken Dialogue Technology for L2 Speaking Practice: What Do Teachers Think?",
    "author": "Timpe-Laughlin, Veronika, Sydorenko, Tetyana, Daurio, Phoebe",
    "description": "Often, second/foreign (L2) language learners receive little opportunity to interact orally in the target language. Interactive, conversation-based spoken dialog systems (SDSs) that use automated speech recognition and natural language processing have the potential to address this need by engaging learners in meaningful, goal-oriented speaking practice. However, these technology-based learning tools are often developed without input from teaching professionals. As part of a larger development effort, this study examined English as a second language (ESL) teachers' perceptions regarding SDS-based speaking tasks, addressing the following research questions: (a) What do teachers think about the SDS-based tasks? (b) How would they use them in the context of their English instruction? Overall, 16 ESL instructors in an intensive English program in the United States were asked to interact with four SDS-based speaking tasks designed to elicit specific linguistic phenomena (e.g. making requests; wh-questions). The teachers completed a survey after each task to gauge their user experience, level of engagement, and perceptions of the usefulness of the tasks for their teaching contexts. A subgroup of instructors (n = 7) also participated in audio-recorded focus group meetings. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each survey item and the open-ended responses from the surveys and focus groups were analyzed qualitatively for major themes. The findings show that teachers had positive views of the SDS tasks' potential for speaking practice and diagnostic purposes, primarily in a flipped classroom model. Their perceptions seemed to be related to their own user experience and, in particular, to the perceived authenticity of a given task.",

    "description": "Although a plethora of research has been conducted on written corrective feedback and timing of feedback in various teaching and learning contexts, there is a paucity of research on learners' preferences regarding different online written corrective feedback. Such a lacuna becomes prominent in EFL contexts, especially in grammar classes, where there are many calls for clear explanations on the rules and uses of language. To fill this gap, the current study reports on a case study regarding how technology can suit pre-service teachers' preferences as to written feedback provided on online quizzes based on four units in Advanced English Grammar class. The study benefited from both qualitative and quantitative approaches to find answers to the research questions. The convenience sampling method was chosen, and the participants of the study included 64 seniors enrolled in the elective course entitled Advanced English Grammar II at a state-run university in the southwest of Turkey. Data collection instruments included four online quizzes supported with different feedback for each answer, and semi-structured interview sessions with the selected participants. Findings indicate that metalinguistic and concordance feedback were the feedback types that the pre-service language teachers most preferred. Immediate feedback was determined to be the most efficient way to support learning based on participants' views and suggestions.",

They were divided evenly into two groups with two peer feedback methods, namely video feedback and written feedback. The feedback process was anonymous to some extent, since the feedback was provided by unknown peers with the instructor as the intermediator. A pretest, a posttest, an online questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview were employed as research instruments. The results indicated that peer video feedback was more effective in improving e-learners' translation performance than written feedback. The questionnaire survey and the interview administered to the video group also showed that the video feedback method was generally welcomed and was advantageous in that it was easier to use than written feedback, saved time, and fostered a sense of belonging.",

    "description": "Many scholars have highlighted the importance of motivation and anxiety in language learning. They have also indicated the advantages of integrating learning content into a mobile-assisted English learning system environment. Meanwhile, a few studies have explored the impacts of a mobile-assisted English learning system on the motivation and English anxiety of elementary school students. This study explores these factors in the English learning achievement of elementary school students by using a mobile-assisted English learning system that includes interesting and interactive games. This study also tries to improve students' learning motivations and decrease their English anxiety through the mobile-assisted English learning system. This quasi-experimental design required 6 weeks to collect the data from the participants. A total of 79 students participated in the experiment, and they were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used a mobile-assisted English learning system to learn. Then, they filled out a questionnaire and evaluated whether the system's operations and their motivation, English anxiety, and perceived usefulness affected their learning achievement. The experimental results indicate that the mobile-assisted English learning system benefits students' learning achievement. Moreover, students with lower levels of English anxiety have better learning achievement than those with higher levels of English anxiety, and higher levels of perceived usefulness result in better learning achievement. These findings could be used as a reference for relevant instructors to find better assisted learning tools and improve students' learning achievement.",

However, there is a dearth in the research on educational use of mobile social media for language learning. This study adopted a qualitative single case study approach to investigate a language teacher's integration of mobile social media in the context of higher education in mainland China, with the aim of exploring educational affordances of mobile social media for language teaching and learning and understanding the relationship between the teacher's technology use and her private theories about technology integration. Data were collected from observation, interviews, as well as documents and artifacts provided by the teacher. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Five educational affordances of mobile social media emerged from the results, including a motivating environment, resources accessing and sharing, evaluation and feedback offering, administration for learning, and content generation. Results also showed that the teacher's private theories about technology integration changed with her adoption of these affordances. However, such changes did not lead to student-centered technology-based learning designs. Implications for teachers as well as teacher educators are provided. Directions for future research are suggested.",

The findings will be used to develop a mobile-based learning environment. Interviews with both instructors and students were used to help build a Likert questionnaire which was refined with input from experts. Results reveal that students have a need for oral presentation training in areas such as slide design, presentation-specific language, structure, and body language. Instructors and students are willing to work with peers on oral presentation projects despite lacking previous experience. Deeper exploration from interviews show students believe sentence level language issues are more important than the organization and design of a presentation. Furthermore, instructors expressed problems with incorporating technology and online collaborative learning into language courses suggesting they need more training with learning technology. Students also believed online collaboration would be convenient but difficult to manage, indicating a need for both online and face-to-face collaboration. These findings will help with the development of a mobile seamless language learning framework and app for oral presentations. Guidelines are suggested to help instructors to improve students' oral presentation performance.",

However, they have mainly focused on the use of available material, and its effects on receptive vocabulary acquisition and students' motivation. In contrast, relatively little has been done to study the effects of student-generated podcasts and Quizlet flashcards sets on second language vocabulary acquisition including productive skills. Hence, the present study seeks to analyze and compare how student-created podcasts and Quizlet flashcards affect vocabulary retention, taking into account both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge. Twenty-three adults, aged 18-61, participated in the study. The instruments used were vocabulary tests as pre-tests to check students' prior knowledge, and as immediate post-tests to measure receptive and productive vocabulary acquisition, and a questionnaire to gauge students' perceptions of the two methods. Results showed that although there was no significant difference between the two methods regarding receptive or productive vocabulary acquisition, and both techniques helped students to retain new vocabulary, participants expressed a greater preference for the Quizlet methodology.",

    "description": "The English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' levels of attention and meditation as well as brainwaves while interacting with an interlocutor in three different second-language (L2) socialization contexts--with another human in person, with another person through a virtual platform, and with an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot--were explored in this study. Thirty participants participated in an experiment, throughout which they were asked to wear a NeuroSky Mindwave headset to assess their real-time levels of attention and meditation, as well as their brainwave activities in each of the three contexts. Statistical analyses of the results revealed a significant effect of the EFL socialization context on participants' level of attention and meditation. The EFL learners' level of attention was highest when they were socializing with other humans in person. When their interlocutor was a chatbot, their level of meditation was highest. When they were interacting with another person in a virtual environment, both their attention and meditation were lowest. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of the dominant ratios of participants' brainwave activities, based on their interactions with interlocutors in all three contexts. The AI chatbot was associated with the greatest dominant ratio of delta and theta brainwaves for EFL learners. Face-to-face L2 socialization with interlocutors triggered alpha and beta brainwaves, whereas interaction with human interlocutors in the virtual environment made gamma brainwaves dominant. The present study is the first to have empirically examined EFL learners' levels of attention and meditation as well as brainwaves during L2 socialization in three different contexts.",

    "author": "Hong, Jon-Chao, Hwang, Ming-Yueh, Liu, Yi-Hsuan, Tai, Kai-Hsin",
    "description": "Different types of gamification can be advantageous to enhancing students' learning. In contrast to the extant gamification literature focusing on designing reward systems and/or facilitating teachers' gamification of learning contents, this study focuses on the gamifying of learning content by students. To verify the efficacy of gamification as a learning activity, the effects of students posing and gamifying questions in relation to second language grammar learning are explored. A gamification platform called &quot;TipOn&quot; was designed to allow students to pose and gamify questions according to different game modes to facilitate their classmates' practicing English grammar. To examine the emotional regulation effects of posing and gamifying questions on learning performance, this study explored the effectiveness of gamifying content by examining how participants' two types of epistemic curiosity (i.e., interest-type epistemic curiosity (IEC) and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity (DEC)) related to posing questions affected their attitude towards gamification (ATG) and their learning progress. In this experiment, participants had to pose English grammar questions related to verb tense, and gamify the questions using TipOn. They then played games using other students' content. Data were collected from 96 ninth-grade students, and the correlations between constructs were evaluated using the path-analytical technique. The research results indicated that, first, English learning anxiety is negatively related to the two aforementioned types of epistemic curiosity. Second, IEC had no significant impact on ATG; however, DEC was positively associated with ATG. Third, ATG could positively predict students' learning progress. The results imply that teachers could use this gamifying system in a flipped classroom to motivate students to tap into their epistemic curiosity to increase their content learning and enhance the effects of learning.",

However, few studies have incorporated context-aware ubiquitous technology into EFL writing instruction. To develop multimodal and digital literacy of target EFL undergraduates in this pilot project, the researchers designed and implemented an augmented-reality context-aware ubiquitous writing (ARCAUW) application, which aimed to increase long-term memory, motivation, and self-regulated cognition in participants' writing development. The pilot project compared the writing outcomes and learner perceptions of the proposed ARCAUW writing mode against the baseline mobile-assisted, classroom-based writing mode. The two writing modes differed in the way that metacognitive scaffolding tasks were carried out. Pre- and post-test results showed that (a) although both modes led to significant improvement in writing the process analysis essay, ARCAUW was conducive to the development of task schema in long-term memory, motivation, and self-regulation in writing, and (b) additional cognitive processing during AR-based learning led to mixed results in writing performance. It was concluded that ARCAUW should be incorporated into mobile-assisted writing courses to reach optimal instructional outcomes. Finally, a five-step procedure was offered to help EFL practitioners design and implement ubiquitous writing in their own teaching contexts.",

    "author": "Chen, Chih-Ming, Li, Ming-Chaun, Lin, Mei-Feng",
    "description": "This study is aimed to design a novel vocabulary learning mechanism (VLM) in the previously developed video-annotated learning and reviewing system (VALRS) that allows learners to identify unfamiliar or unknown words when listening to the video and generate personalized input enhancement from English subtitles for vocabulary learning. It is expected that the VALRS with VLM (VALRS-VLM) can help learners improve their English listening comprehension in the recognition of speech sounds of individual vocabulary words and meaning understanding of vocabulary words and oral sentences. To investigate the learning effectiveness and learners' experiences of the newly developed VLM, this study compared the outcomes of English listening comprehension performance and technology acceptance between the experimental group using the VALRS-VLM and the control group using the VALRS without the VLM (VALRS-NVLM). Analytical results show that the learners using the VALRS-VLM achieved remarkably better in both English listening learning outcomes and learning retention for vocabulary learning and overall English listening comprehension performance than those who used the VALRS-NVLM. Besides, according to the results of the questionnaire surveyed after the experiment, both the VALRS-VLM and VALRS-NVLM groups showed good technology acceptance. This study confirms that the proposed VALRS-VLM could effectively facilitate learners' English listening learning as well as provide them with a positive learning experience.",

    "description": "Autonomy of language learners in technology-supported learning environments has attracted much scholarly attention. However, few studies, to date, have examined the issue in the emerging context of language MOOCs. The present study complemented this line of research via a qualitative investigation of a group of Chinese EFL learners in an English language MOOC. Data were collected via a prior interview (N = 38), four interviews held at different stages of the MOOC (N = 36, 27, 17, 13, respectively), and a post-course interview for dropouts (N = 14). A framework consisting of seven constructs in three dimensions, namely, the situational, the behavioral, and the psychological, was employed for analyzing the data. The results showed that the learners exhibited individual and dimensional variation in the extent to which they exercised autonomy. Participants were also observed to have adopted a variety of metacognitive strategies, motivation control strategies, and emotion control strategies to regulate their learning. The findings highlight the complexity of learner autonomy as displayed in the new learning interface as well as the potential of language MOOCs for fostering learner autonomy.",

Six relevant constructs--intention to use technology, perceived usefulness, attitudes toward use of technology, technology self-efficacy, facilitating conditions and experience of technology use--were incorporated into three hypothesized models. A total of 331 preservice L2 Chinese teachers from two national key universities in China participated in this study. Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Model comparison results showed that the third hypothesized model fit the data best. Specifically, perceived usefulness, technology self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions had direct positive effects on attitudes toward use of technology, while perceived usefulness, attitudes toward use of technology, and experience of technology use showed a positive influence on intention to use technology. This study enriches our understanding of technology acceptance by extending consideration to under-studied preservice L2 Chinese teachers in China. Implications for schools and teacher educators are also discussed.",

    "author": "Engwall, Olov, Lopes, Jos\u00e9",
    "description": "This article analyses how robot-learner interaction in robot-assisted language learning (RALL) is influenced by the interaction behaviour of the robot. Since the robot behaviour is to a large extent determined by the combination of teaching strategy, robot role and robot type, previous studies in RALL are first summarised with respect to which combinations that have been chosen, the rationale behind the choice and the effects on interaction and learning. The goal of the summary is to determine a suitable pedagogical set-up for RALL with adult learners, since previous RALL studies have almost exclusively been performed with children and youths. A user study in which 33 adult second language learners practice Swedish in three-party conversations with an anthropomorphic robot head is then presented. It is demonstrated how different robot interaction behaviours influence interaction between the robot and the learners and between the two learners. Through an analysis of learner interaction, collaboration and learner ratings for the different robot behaviours, it is observed that the learners were most positive towards the robot behaviour that focused on interviewing one learner at the time (highest average ratings), but that they were the most active in sessions when the robot encouraged learner-learner interaction. Moreover, the preferences and activity differed between learner pairs, depending on, e.g., their proficiency level and how well they knew the peer. It is therefore concluded that the robot behaviour needs to adapt to such factors. In addition, collaboration with the peer played an important part in conversation practice sessions to deal with linguistic difficulties or communication problems with the robot.",

    "author": "Jiang, Lianjiang, Yu, Shulin",
    "description": "While automated feedback is becoming readily accessible to student writers, how students employ resources and strategies to use such feedback remains largely unexplored. Informed by activity theory and the construct of appropriation, this study conceptualizes students' use of automated feedback as social appropriation mediated by resources and internalization strategies. Based on multiple sources of data including students' drafts, automated feedback and submission information, semi-structured interviews and documents, this study explored a cohort of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students' experiences of appropriating automated feedback in their writing activities. The findings revealed three forms of appropriation (i.e., regular, partial, and rare) among the students, who had used various artifacts (e.g., dictionary) and rules (e.g., teacher requirement), taken on different roles (e.g., student writer, spotlight-avoider), and resorted to different community members (e.g., peers) to mediate their appropriation. The findings also showed that the students further differed in their internalization of the resources through three sub-processes: selecting, emotion-regulating, and goal-setting. These findings pose a critical need to revisit the idea that submission for immediate automated feedback is motivating and to watch the potential washback effect of setting a threshold score when pedagogically using automated feedback. The study argues that students should develop their awareness of the mediating resources and the internationalization strategies for more self-regulated use of automated feedback.",

    "description": "This study investigates the effectiveness of using Google Translate as a translingual CALL tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing, keyed to the perceptions of both more highly proficient Chinese English major university students and less-proficient non-English majors. After watching a 5-minute passage from a movie, each cohort of students was asked to write an extemporaneous reflective essay. Students first wrote a text in Chinese, then composed a corresponding text in English, submitted their Chinese text to Google Translate (GT), compared the translated English GT text with their own self-written (SW) text, and finally revised their self-written English (RSW) text by referring to their GT text. Student perceptions of the activity were elicited by a questionnaire. Two types of online computational assessments evaluated students' writing performance for all the SW, GT and RSW versions. Results indicate that GT texts showed significantly better writing performance in delivering more enriched content, using more advanced vocabulary and making fewer spelling and grammatical errors than the SW texts. RSW texts showed a significant improvement over SW versions, especially for the non-English major students. Students using Google Translate as a revision tool displayed better L2 performance in written language and content than in their self-writing, and especially non-English major students showed significantly more positive attitudes towards the use of Google Translate than English major students.",

Over a six-month period, the teachers used the digital application to self-assess their classes, make decisions and introduce changes into their teaching practices. The researchers observed four class sessions of each teacher and assessed them with the same digital application. Each teacher-researcher dyad discussed the tool and its use over three meetings during the semester. Despite some differences between the teachers, use of the digital application produced progress in the competences of both the teachers and the students. Thus, the digital application can be used for professional development in teachers.",

Also, it intends to classify the reviewed literature following a general categorisation of MOOCs, and to identify the main trends and topics of interest for LMOOC researchers. Results show that there is still a lack of LMOOC-related articles in CALL (computer assisted language learning) journals, since most of the publications in the period reviewed (2012-18) are conference papers. The country in which most studies have been done so far is Spain and Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia (UNED) is currently the most active institution in this area. Within the taxonomy established, the most popular categories of studies focused on LMOOC participants or providers and case studies. Systematic review of the published literature indicated that research trends in LMOOCs studies comprise: 1) conceptualisation of LMOOCs and their distinctive features; 2) attempts to find the most suitable model for language teaching and learning beyond the xMOOC/cMOOC dichotomy; 3) suitability of LMOOCs for languages for specific purposes (LSP) courses; 4) focus on the learners and their motivation and experience throughout the course; 5) reflection on the new role of the teacher; 6) instructional design and how it affects participants' learning and possible attrition; and 7) importance of social learning in LMOOCs. Nevertheless, LMOOCs is still an emerging field in need of further serious studies.",

    "description": "Promoting students' digital literacy has become a significant challenge for educational authorities and course designers. However, very limited attention has been directed toward junior high school students' digital literacy in the literature of computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Thus, this mixed-methods study explored junior high school teachers' and students' perspectives on the students' digital literacy level and issues pertaining to it. A total of 364 junior high school students, 20 junior high school teachers, and three Directors of the Ministry of Education of Iran participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis was run to ensure the construct validity of the questionnaire. The results of the Mann-Whitney U test showed significant differences between the perceptions of the teachers and students. While the students and teachers reported that students had an acceptable level of digital literacy in the interviews, the questionnaire results showed that the students had a low to moderate level of digital literacy. The teachers and students believed that the junior high school students used technology for recreational and non-educational purposes. The junior high school students did not use a wide range of computer applications and software tools. The interview with the Directors of the Ministry of Education depicted that they did not have consensus on the issues related to junior high school students' digital literacy and that the Ministry did not have clear plans for promoting students' digital literacy levels. The study proposes implications for the renewal of the English as a foreign language (EFL) curriculum of junior high schools and the integration of CALL in EFL programs in Iran and other similar contexts.",

Fifty-two Iranian EFL learners were randomly assigned into two audio and video recasts conditions as well as two audio and video control groups. During five treatment sessions, the participants in the audio recasts group performed several online communicative tasks via their smartphones with their interlocutor and received recasts in response to their errors during audio interactions. The participants in the video recasts group performed the same tasks and received recasts during video interactions. The analyses of the learners' post-test scores indicated the benefits of recasts provided during both audio and video interactions for L2 development although recasts provided during audio interactions proved to be more effective than recasts delivered during video interactions. The analyses of learners' perceptions of recasts and also their responses to recasts revealed that the learners had more accurate perceptions of audio recasts and that the participants produced more target-like modified output in response to audio recasts compared to the video recasts. The implications for language teaching, especially technology-based and distance education, will be discussed in the study.",

    "description": "VR technology allows learners to access simulated, immersive and interactive virtual environments to perform authentic learning activities. In particular, VR has emerged as a valuable tool for L2 learning. However, VR research has tended to pay more attention to desktop-based VR than to VR via mobile-rendered HMDs, leaving the potentials of VR through mobile-rendered HMDs yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study fills the gap by using a commercial VR app to examine the effect of VR via mobile-rendered HMDs on EFL learners' vocabulary learning. Forty-nine seventh graders in Taiwan were recruited from two intact classes and assigned to either an experimental (VR players) or control (video watchers) group. The VR players interacted with Mondly VR app using mobile-rendered HMDs and took part in conversations with virtual characters. The video watchers watched the walkthrough video signal of the VR player's app via a personal computer. Vocabulary tests, a perception questionnaire, and interviews were used to evaluate the participants' vocabulary learning. The results showed that the VR players' vocabulary learning and retention was significantly higher than the video watchers'. The majority of the VR players felt that VR-mediated vocabulary learning was motivating and beneficial. The VR app contextualized vocabulary learning by providing virtual environments with multimodal support and enhanced learner engagement through real-time interactivity and feedback. The video watchers' feedback revealed mixed feelings. Some felt that the walkthrough video facilitated vocabulary learning by providing word meaning and use in context. Others reported it lacked interactivity and their attention was easily distracted.",

    "description": "The paper examines the emotions of 15 learners of Japanese across seven weekly online text chats in Japanese with native Japanese speakers, and the factors that caused their emotions. The data came from questionnaires about the learners' biodata and previous experiences of text chats, weekly reports about their chats, transcripts of the chats, and occasional questions in e-mail exchanges between the researcher and the learners to clarify certain statements in the weekly reports. The learners' positive and negative emotions and the causes of those emotions were coded and counted for descriptive quantitative analysis. The learners reported both positive and negative emotions within each individual chat as well as across the seven weeks. Enjoyment was the most frequently occurring of the positive emotions, while a sense of difficulty was most often reported among the negative emotions. Both positive and negative emotions changed over the seven weeks. The chat process and issues with the Japanese language tended to be triggers for negative emotions, with positive emotions likely to be triggered by the chat partners, and also by discussions of hobbies, similar interests and culture. It would appear to be important for learners to develop a rapport with their partner through chat communications and to avoid focusing too much on their own limited foreign language proficiency in order to increase their positive emotions in online text chats, thus improving the experience and leading to greater learning.",

    "description": "Theoretically grounded in Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of mind, Dynamic Assessment (DA) provides researchers with the opportunity to investigate different aspects of learners' developmental trajectory, including the ways they overcome their errors. As a qualitative inquiry into the nature of errors reflecting learners' development in academic writing and the ways they are treated, this study examined the role of face-to-face (FTF) and Computer-Mediated (CM) contexts on the ways Iranian EFL learners dealt with their main developmental errors. In this study, the nature of developmental errors emerged out of the analysis of a writing corpus of four learners participating in a two-month DA based academic writing course. The learners' high-frequency errors were examined through the microgentic development method, which allows for investigating the moment to moment changes in learners' performance, to reveal the ways they were addressed in FTF and CM contexts of DA. The results highlighted the different effects of FTF and CM contexts on learners' pace, depth and permanency of development through not only employing different mediation forms but also encouraging the usage of different mediational tools. The findings indicated that while FTF mediation led to an inclination toward collaborative writing, CM mediation increased learners' engagement with their written texts by focusing more on difficult items and transferring development to other tasks and situations which, in turn, illustrates their progression towards self-regulation. The findings of the study shed light on the potentials of DA in guiding learners' struggle to overcome their academic writing developmental errors in both CM and FTF contexts.",

    "author": "Rienties, Bart, Lewis, Tim, O'Dowd, Robert, Rets, Irina, Rogaten, Jekaterina",
    "description": "Several studies on Virtual Exchange (VE) have highlighted positive learning experiences, increases in technological pedagogical and content skills (TPACK) and foreign language (FL) competence. However, most VE research to date use qualitative or descriptive case-studies of how VEs have been implemented, and what &quot;might&quot; have worked. In this large-scale quantitative two-study design, we explored how 622 pre-service teachers developed TPACK skills and (perceived) FL competence over time in 23 VEs across 34 institutions in 16 countries. In Study 1, we used a (quasi-) experimental design of 3 VEs in an experimental (n = 151) or control group (n = 77) to explore the impact on TPACK. In Study 2, we used a larger sample of 20 VEs and 394 participants to replicate and contrast the findings from Study 1 in a broader context. In contrast to our expectations, participants in the experimental condition did not have higher TPACK skills growth relative to the control condition in Study 1, which was further confirmed in Study 2. Nonetheless, in Study 2 pre-existing TPACK skills influenced the development of (perceived) FL competence over time, whereby those participants who further strengthened their TPACK skills during the VE were more likely to nurture FL competence. A major lesson from this large-scale implementation is that VEs do not generate TPACK skills and FL competence by osmosis. We encourage CALL researchers to carefully reflect on any positive or negative finding that something has &quot;worked&quot; when there is no comparison or control group included.",

    "description": "Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the use of automated writing evaluation (AWE) in second language writing classrooms. This increase is partially due to the belief that AWE can assist teachers by allowing them to devote more feedback to higher-level (HL) writing skills, such as content and organization, while the technology addresses lower-level (LL) skills, such as grammar. As is speculated, student revisions will then be positively impacted. However, little evidence has supported these claims, calling into question the impact of AWE on teaching and learning. The current study explored these claims by comparing two second language writing classes that were assigned to either an AWE + teacher feedback condition or a teacher-only-feedback condition. Findings suggest that using AWE as a complement to teacher feedback did not have a significant impact on the amount of HL teacher feedback, but the teacher who did not use AWE tended to provide a greater amount of LL feedback than AWE alone. Furthermore, students seemed to revise the teacher's LL feedback more frequently than LL feedback from the computer. Interestingly, students retained their improvement in accuracy in the long-term when they had access to AWE, but students who did not have access appeared to have lower retention. We explain the relevance of our findings in relation to an argument-based validation framework to align our work with state-of-the-art research in the field and contribute to a broader discussion about how AWE can be best provided to support second language writing development.",

    "author": "Jia, Chengyuan, Hew, Khe Foon Timothy",
    "description": "Lower-level processes have long been overlooked in EFL listening pedagogy. To address this pervasive problem, in this study, a program was designed that integrated WeChat, the most popular mobile instant messaging app in China, into dictation practice. Students in two classes studying a compulsory university EFL course were selected as participants, with one class as the experimental group (EG, n = 37) and the other as the control group (CG, n = 33). Both groups attended the same weekly in-class listening course taught by the same instructor, in which traditional listening exercises were combined with explicit decoding instructions. Members of the EG were asked to participate in a WeChat group of 8-10 students to complete daily dictation, while the CG did the practice individually. A listening test served as pre- and post-test, and an open-question survey was used to collect the EG's perceptions of the WeChat dictation program. The results show that the EG's improvement in listening was significantly greater than that of the CG. There were no differences in improvement in participants' listening comprehension between males and female, whereas listening gains differed significantly between the EG and the CG when participants were at different initial listening levels. The students' perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of the program are discussed.",

    "description": "Although regulation has become a critical method to improve the effect of collaborative writing in L2 classes, it is still not clear how the regulation activities influence peer interactions, which is important for improvement of regulation itself. This case study examined dynamic interactions of several small teams of ESL students when they performed two collaborative argument writing tasks without and with regulation. Interaction patterns were identified in terms of 'equality' and 'mutuality' and different interaction patterns occurred when these learners switched between tasks. The dynamic features of peer interactions were explained according to an extended activity model. This study enriched the observation of how regulation affected peer interactions through sociocultural factors. The result can provide insights into how regulation activity should be designed and improved for web-based collaborative writing activities in L2 classes.",

In addition, the authors discuss students' preferences regarding the two communication modes. Ninety-seven students from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (Spain) took part in the study. A 12-item quantitative questionnaire using a four-point Likert scale and an open-ended qualitative questionnaire were used. The results showed that students considered self-created videos to be effective tools for developing their oracy skills. However, results were not conclusive for students' preferences regarding mode of communication. Contrary to our expectations, a considerable number of students did not feel confident in their use of video presentations and felt intimidated by the cameras. This suggests that a greater emphasis should be put on the development of digital communication skills to prepare our students for the new communication reality.",

    "description": "This is the first study to investigate the effects of test methods (while-listening performance and post-listening performance) and gender on measured listening ability and brain activation under test conditions. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to examine three brain regions associated with listening comprehension: the inferior frontal gyrus and posterior middle temporal gyrus, which subserve bottom-up processing in comprehension, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which mediates top-down processing. A Rasch model reliability analysis showed that listeners were homogeneous in their listening ability. Additionally, there were no significant differences in test scores across test methods and genders. The fNIRS data, however, revealed significantly different activation of the investigated brain regions across test methods, genders, and listening abilities. Together, these findings indicated that the listening test was not sensitive to differences in the neurocognitive processes underlying listening comprehension under test conditions. The implications of these findings for assessing listening and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

Having a qualitative research design, the research has utilized an action research model. The research was conducted in two different classes with first-year university students studying at the Department of Turkish Education (N = 61). Students have produced two different digital stories (DSTs) throughout the course. The first DST was created individually, and the second collaboratively. Students actively participated in producing and criticizing the phases of digital stories. The researcher and students' diaries and focus group interviews were used as data collection tools. Data were analyzed through the Nvivo 12 qualitative data analysis program. During the analysis process, data were first converted into codes, and the obtained codes were divided into themes and sub-themes. Findings indicated that students have a perception that collaborative DST improves their writing skills. It is reflected in the student views that collaborative DST positively affects the internal and external structure of the text. The multimedia feature and the script have positive effect on writing and help to harmonize technology and writing.",

The study followed a pre/post/delayed posttest design that examined the participants' learning of phrases and their pronunciations in Dutch, combined with a qualitative analysis of video recordings of their interactions with GT. Findings indicate that the participants were able to acquire Dutch vocabulary and pronunciation on a short-term basis, and that they interacted with GT's translation, TTS, and ASR in different ways and to different extents. This demonstrates that GT is a versatile tool that can be easily tailored to suit learners' needs, interests, and learning styles.",

In this study, the researcher examines teaching and learning processes in which a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) design model was crafted and used for an advanced instructional design course in the educational technology field. The focus is on the researcher's ongoing and recursive reflective experiences in reviewing design components of the model, analyzing the motivators and difficulties students faced, and offering alternative methods to improve the initial design. The findings show that the PBL approach played an instrumental role in creating real challenges that the target professionals may experience. On the other hand, observed difficulties in PBL include intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive loads associated with the complexity of the instructional design process, self-regulated learning skills, learning beliefs, and supporting strategies used for team dynamics. The patterns identified in the behaviors and perceptions of effective and struggling students are interpreted. Based on the findings, new constructs of the model were suggested for further improvement.",

    "description": "As educators and administrators look to countless mobile apps, software programs, and web-based learning tools to meet the demands of students in remote, virtual, and hybrid settings, risks and assumptions of online platforms and assessments must be considered. With the urgency of the COVID-response closure of many schools and the unusual methods employed during the return to school in Fall 2020, there is no better time to examine the digital application literacy which is necessary for students to effectively transition to online learning and assessment. &quot;Digital application literacy&quot; (DAppLit), a specific form of media literacy, involves the nimble use of an app (web-based) or application (computer-based) for education, including assessment. Learners with impaired DAppLit face academic consequences, when insufficient literacy in the platform is the culprit. This paper first explores various skills and strategies from both traditional and digital assessments that digital application literacy requires. Then, it presents the value of low-stakes assessment experiences with applications to introduce navigation techniques and troubleshoot barriers users may face before undertaking weighted assessments. The importance of skills instruction and practice of DAppLit methods is presented. A four-step process is introduced to: (1) set learning goals; (2) guide learners through the application with explicit instructions before use; (3) provide low-stakes explorations; and (4) debrief to address any issues which could represent a failing of application literacy and not content knowledge in an assessment.",

    "author": "Woods, David",
    "description": "Providing feedback on student work is a key part of the teaching process. Ideally, students use the provided feedback to learn and improve future work. In the age of technology-mediated learning, it is essential to study how technology affects the feedback process. This work uses data captured by a Learning Management System (LMS) to measure whether students view the feedback provided by an instructor. Unfortunately, the data show that only a limited number of students actually viewed the provided feedback. A technology-focused review of the feedback process is used to identify how technology may contribute to students' limited use of feedback. Suggestions are offered for how instructors, pedagogy researchers, and developers of technology used in learning can collaborate to ensure that technology supports the best pedagogical practices identified by research and also provides the tools and data needed to support ongoing pedagogical research.",

    "description": "Online presentation is emerging when classroom presentation is not possible. This study was to compare students' interactivity between the asynchronized online presentations with hashtags and the synchronized classroom presentations. This was a secondary analysis with seven courses conducted between 2016 and 2020. Students' interactivity in group presentations was evaluated from the videos recorded in classrooms and the posts on social media. Three and four courses in the classroom mode and online mode, respectively were included. Students' presentations if posted in social media with hashtags, it gained higher accessibility, more attention, more views and the interactions between the presenters and the audiences generated more themes. No significant difference was found between groups in students' self-reported learning experience on exchanging ideas, learning from various sources and engaging in their own learning. The application of hashtags allowed more time and more viewers to give feedback to the students.",

    "description": "While virtual reality (VR) technology can provide students with first-hand and situational learning experiences, limited studies have integrated VR in a K-12 classroom, resulting in the lack of understanding of the benefits and challenges of VR use in classroom settings. To examine the impact of VR on student learning, this study employed a mixed-methods quasi-experimental research approach and integrated a fully immersive VR (i.e., Oculus Quest) and non-immersive VR (i.e., 3D website) into 9th-grade social studies classrooms. The findings demonstrated that while the quantitative data did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in knowledge development and classroom engagement after students use VR, qualitative data showed positive learning benefits and classroom engagement. Furthermore, statistically significant growth was observed in the development of historical empathy with VR use. The findings share critical insight into the impact of VR on student learning and the challenges of VR integration in a K-12 classroom.",

    "description": "Many undergraduate and graduate courses have been recently converted to fully remote offerings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even within the remote structure, courses vary in their frequency of synchronous and asynchronous meetings. Fostering collaboration through students' idea-sharing and supporting their learning is especially challenging in the asynchronous setting where it is challenging to replicate in-person communities of practice. This is especially the case in courses that are very theoretical and have traditionally relied on discussion boards for engaging students asynchronously. This paper aims to contribute to the research on technology-enhanced communities of practice by offering examples of digital discourse among peers that can be implemented asynchronously, including social annotations and jointly-developed slideshows with voice annotation. These methods allow for higher-quality interaction between learners, between learners and content, and between learners and the instructor.",

    "description": "Parent involvement is a reverently studied, crucial concept that impacts overall student achievement. An educational technology tool, involvED, was developed by a School Psychologist and Licensed Clinical Social Worker using principles of behavioral change research and grounded in family systems theory. Incorporating a scientific approach for targeted, meaningful intervention in regards to family involvement allows for addressment of equity gaps by educating underprivileged families on vital skills, including academic readiness, social emotional learning and trauma informed practices and responses, all while providing incentives for various levels of engagement. The researchers hypothesized that by educating families in an efficient, convenient and consistent manner, as well as providing user- selected incentives for engagement, it would not only increase parent attendance at school events, but also increase the academic, social and emotional skills of the child. Positive statistically significant effects were found amongst users of the tool on both dependent variables, event attendance and the academic, social and emotional ratings of the targeted students by the classroom teacher via the SAEBRS. By addressing potential parental skill deficits and incentivizing prosocial behaviors, student outcomes are positively affected, influencing a breadth of stakeholders.",

There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete reading and the ability to recall the content when the children read from the three mediums (P &gt; 0.05). The average eye fixation duration was however significantly higher when the children read from a smartphone (P &lt; 0.05). Children aged nine and ten years used hyperlinks more often while reading from a smartphone than a computer (P &lt; 0.05).

    "description": "This study quantitatively measures the variation in language derived from a targeted set of digital game mechanics. Mechanics refer to the design elements of a game that make up the overall gameplay experience, determining player actions and the degree of language interaction. A corpus was compiled by extracting the language files from two popular commercial games, Fallout 4 and Skyrim, using modification software. The extracted language files were organized into three register categories following the register analysis framework detailed in Biber and Conrad (2019). The three categories include one spoken (dialogue trees) and two written registers (quest objectives and quest stages), which are common mechanics in many modern commercial games. Comparing results from three discriminant analyses, the findings indicate that statistical models cannot distinguish between the two games' linguistic environments at the level of the game; however, when considering the linguistic environments at the level of game mechanics, the model has high precision in accurately identifying the texts' game mechanic register categories. The results provide empirical evidence that digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) research designs could benefit from targeting specific design aspects and game mechanics rather than generalizing results at the level of genre or game title.",

DDL research represented 4.2% of all published papers on CALL during this time frame. The main focus of research was found to be the use of concordancing and collocations when developing university students' writing skills. Contrary to previous research, access to technology was not identified as an impeding factor for normalisation. Syllabus integration and a lack of contribution from language teachers other than researchers emerged as threats to the normalisation of corpora use. Further theorisation is needed if DDL and corpora are to expand their influence on mainstream second language education.",

    "author": "Tseng, Jun-Jie, Chai, Ching Sing, Tan, Lynde, Park, Moonyoung",
    "description": "Research on TPACK has been burgeoning recently. Some review studies in the field of educational technology have indicated issues and trends in TPACK research conducted in the past decades. However, a review of TPACK research specific to language teachers' knowledge about language teaching with technology has been lacking. To fill this research gap, the present review study intends to understand the landscape of TPACK research on language teachers published from 2011 to 2019. The analysis results reveal that 51 studies were identified with a publication peak in 2015, mostly conducted in Asia and the Middle East. The 51 articles were categorized into four areas: (a) exploring TPACK, (b) assessing TPACK, (c) developing TPACK, and (d) applying TPACK. More specifically, research on exploring TPACK suggests that while teachers had varying levels of confidence in their TPACK competence, their TPACK indicated the dominant use of technology in traditional teacher-centered teaching. Research on assessing TPACK shows that survey items were contextualized to lessen the difficulty of distinguishing between the seven sub-domains of TPACK. However, the difficulty remained perhaps due to a possibility that the seven sub-domains may not appear workable in practice. This issue needs further research. Research on developing TPACK reveals that effective interventions involved language teachers' understanding of the TPACK framework, modeling from teacher educators or experienced teachers, and language teachers' engagement in designing lessons collaboratively. Finally, research on applying TPACK indicates that TPACK-informed language learning courses and platforms were perceived to be helpful and effective. These findings may provide researchers with some possible directions.",

    "description": "The present work synthesizes the studies in flipped language education based on Social Sciences Citation Index publications up to the year 2018. A sum of 33 studies were finalized as the targeted studies and our research questions were formulated regarding (1) the overall trend and features of the existing studies, (2) their research foci, (3) the role of technology, and (4) the integration of FL/L2 learning and teaching theories, models or strategies into flipped classroom. Some research gaps were identified, including a bias toward outcome-oriented quantitative studies over process-oriented qualitative studies. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of the studies were conducted from the learners' perspectives, while few studies took the teachers' perspectives. More importantly, to guide the course design and implementation, the present review proposed a comprehensive 'interaction model' integrating four key elements into flipped FL/L2 education. The model featured two types of interaction, namely 'interaction with content' and 'interaction via content', highlighting the uniqueness of flipped FL/L2 education. The study incorporated learner preparedness in the interaction model, entailing a practical interface for the principle of 'design for failure', that is, predicting and preparing contingencies for the times when in-class interactions do not go as planned for technical or other reasons.",

    "author": "Khong, Hou Keat, Kabilan, Muhammad Kamarul",
    "description": "The notion of &quot;Micro-Learning&quot; (ML) has been repeatedly accented as a successful learning approach in different learning phenomena. Despite these optimistic emphases, several studies lack a theoretical grounding in adoption of ML, thus missing a shared perspective of the education community. The scarce theoretical justification for understanding the nuanced dynamics of ML restricts the practical use of this pedagogical approach in &quot;Second Language&quot; (L2) instruction. Therefore, this paper seeks to fill the gap by proposing a theoretical model of ML for L2 instruction. First, a brief background on ML is provided evaluating its benefits and pitfalls in general teaching and learning enterprise. Second, three established theories are explicitly discussed based on a careful examination of the conceptual characteristics and empirical observations of ML. A theoretical model of ML is then devised based on relations postulated among proposed theories and application of the model to existing L2 MLs is made explicit. Finally, implications for research and practice are discussed to offer a more robust and descriptive picture of how ML can promote L2 teaching and learning across different contexts. Drawing from these theoretical insights, a principled way to integrating ML into L2 instruction can be made available for future research.",

Educator perception of ELs' use of the features was also investigated. Of the ten features examined, five (Colored Overlays, Color Contrast, Highlighter, Line Guide, and Magnifier) were available across the four language domains (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) and five were specific to writing (Sticky Notes, Cut, Copy, Paste, and Underline). In a two-phase mixed-methods study, first 377 K-12 EL educators completed a survey and nine educators were further interviewed. Findings were analyzed according to educators': (1) perception of online accessibility features, (2) instruction of the features, and (3) perception of ELs' use of the features. Educators perceived the Highlighter, Line Guide, Copy, and Paste to be more important than others, which affected their instruction. Results provide practical implications for instructing and designing online accessibility features in K-12 English language proficiency assessments.",

    "description": "A fundamental requirement of language assessments which is underresearched in computerized assessments is impartiality (fairness) or equal treatment of test takers regardless of background. The present study aimed to evaluate fairness in the Pearson Test of English (PTE) Academic Reading test, which is a computerized reading assessment, by investigating differential item functioning (DIF) across Indo-European (IE) and Non-Indo-European (NIE) language families. Previous research has shown that similarities between readers' mother tongue and the second language being learned can advantage some test takers. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from 783 international test takers who took the PTE Academic test, using the partial credit model in Rasch measurement. We examined two main types of DIF: uniform DIF (UDIF), which occurs when an item consistently gives a particular group of test takers an advantage across all levels of ability, and non-uniform DIF (NUDIF), which occurs when the performance of test takers varies across the ability continuum. The results showed no statistically significant UDIF (p &gt; 0.05), but identified 3 NUDIF items out of 10 items across the language families. A mother tongue advantage was not observed. Similarity in test takers' level of computer and Internet skills, test preparation, and language policies could contribute to the finding of no UDIF. Post-hoc content analysis of items suggested that the decrease of mother tongue advantage for IE groups in high-proficiency groups and lucky guesses of low-ability groups may have contributed to the emergence of NUDIF items. Lastly, recommendations for investigating social and contextual factors are proposed.",

Participating instructors completed an initial survey documenting existing knowledge of, experiences with, and attitudes towards corpus-aided language learning and teaching, a second open-ended questionnaire at the mid-point of the academic term exploring their experiences, and a final instrument assessing how their attitudes had potentially evolved, either positively or negatively, and their likelihood for continued implementation of corpus-aided pedagogy in their classrooms. To offer a balanced perspective, data was also collected from three teachers who chose not to implement corpus activities in their courses. Findings display generally positive attitudes towards corpus study but also reveal emergent tensions regarding the use of ready-made corpus activities and the key affordances of discovery, authenticity, and autonomy often forwarded in support of corpus pedagogy.",

English language learners (ELLs) participated in weekly online exchanges on a video discussion platform called Flipgrid in the form of oral dialogue journals for reflection on their academic learning and experiences during these disruptive times. These ELLs' video journals and peer responses (N = 198) were collected for content analysis, in order to investigate how the use of video-based asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) can establish positive social and emotional support and a sense of community. The findings of the study indicate that ACMC was successful in establishing interconnectedness in terms of high levels of self-disclosure, positive facial expressions, and other indicators of social and emotional support, demonstrating social presence. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of how social presence is expressed and fostered in video-based ACMC communities during emergency remote teaching.",

    "author": "Back, Michele, Zavala, Virginia, Franco, Raiza",
    "description": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected K-12 education worldwide, Peru has faced particularly unique challenges. A combination of quarantine requirements and unequal access to remote learning technology led to the creation of a series of multimodal programs by Peru's Ministry of Education under the umbrella title Aprendo en Casa [I Learn at Home]. Modules for preschool, primary, and secondary grades are broadcast via national television and radio networks, as well as posted on YouTube in an attempt to reach as many learners in the country as possible. In this article, we focus on Aprendo en Casa's radio broadcasts for Spanish as a second language (SL2). Our data comprise transcribed SL2 radio broadcasts, educational materials, and interviews with primary school teachers. Findings indicate that a lack of access to technology in rural areas, even for radio broadcasts, is inscribed in historical inequities and ideologies regarding the rural population, exacerbating the so-called &quot;digital divide&quot; and complicating the traditionally dichotomous perspective on this divide. We highlight student and parent difficulties with access and technological know-how, as well as some of the creative ways that teachers provided access to the curriculum for students and family members, often at risk to their own health and finances. We conclude with suggestions for improving research and practice in emergency distance language education for marginalized populations.",

    "description": "Across the globe, the emergence of COVID-19 led to widespread, sudden suspension of in-person instruction, displacing more than 1.5 billion learners (Capilla et al., 2020). Addressing the gap in research on emergency remote teaching (ERT), this empirical study draws on insights from semi-structured interviews with 10 in-service and five pre-service teachers, who navigated the transition both as K-12 teachers and graduate students, participating in weekly mentoring for English language learners, online curricular modules, face-to-face discussions (until the transition to ERT), mixed-reality simulation teaching with coaching, and written reflections. Using a sensemaking theoretical framework, our study examines the following questions: (1) What were the main challenges and opportunities of ERT as experienced by this cohort of language teachers? (2) How did the dual role of being a K-12 teacher and graduate student provide a unique lens for navigating these challenges and opportunities? (3) What tools or supports helped these language teachers through the transition to ERT? Thematic analysis revealed three themes (emotion, shared meaning, and technology) and illuminated connection as an overarching theme. Findings suggest that the experience of navigating the transition from both positions led to greater empathy, increased facility using technology, and a growing support network of fellow teacher-learners.",

    "description": "In line with the 2021 CALICO Conference theme &quot;Global realities,&quot; we presented a plenary on how immersive virtual reality (IVR) could be used for second language learning by allowing learners to virtually travel around the globe via headset. The main affordances of virtual reality (VR) technology include immersing learners in an authentic cultural context almost anywhere on the globe, while manifesting a strong sense of presence and enabling learning through embodied cognition, which involves kinesthetic engagement. In this article, we first review current models of immersive learning and note how certain processes of second language and culture learning are missing in these models. Using some examples of IVR apps for second language learning, we discuss the research to date that focuses on the affordances of the technology for languaculture learning and propose how the effectiveness of these apps could be studied, expanding on the cognitive-affective model of immersive learning (CAMIL, proposed by Makransky &amp; Petersen, 2021) to include social factors. We conclude with some recommendations for the development of future IVR apps for languaculture learning that follow our expanded theoretical model.",

After completing a pre-vocabulary recognition test to determine the level of equality between groups, students watched the video and immediately completed a post-visual recognition test and a post-recall protocol test to determine students' visual content gain and/or recall. Overall, the keyword captions group responded to visual questions about the video just as well as the no captions group, and somewhat better than the full captions group. In addition, the no captions group significantly outperformed the keyword and full captions groups on visual recall. Based on eye-tracking data, the more one looked within the captions field, the less one gained visually from the video. These results have implications for how one designs L2 video lessons with captions.",

    "description": "In light of globalization and advancements in communication technologies, telecollaboration is increasingly used for promoting the professional development of language teachers. However, very few reviews have been conducted to examine teachers' telecollaborative learning. To address this gap, this study provides a systematic review of 56 telecollaborative studies that focused on teacher professional learning and were published between 2010 and 2020. The study aims to address the following two questions: What are the main characteristics of methodologies used in teacher telecollaborative studies? What are the main characteristics of pedagogical applications of teacher telecollaborative studies? Besides reporting on emerging methodological trends among the primary studies, this synthesis uncovers three patterns in the pedagogical applications: (a) diversification of mixed pedagogical models, (b) increased integration of pedagogical mentoring across telecollaborative learning stages, and (c) increased integration of telecollaboration in classroom practices. These findings offer implications for future research and practice in the field of language teacher education.",

    "description": "Technology has paved the way for new modalities in language learning, teaching, and assessment. However, there is still a great deal of work to be done to develop such tools for oral communication, specifically tools that address suprasegmental features in pronunciation instruction. Therefore, this critical literature review examines how researchers have tried to create computer-assisted pronunciation training tools using automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to aid language learners in the perception and production of suprasegmental features. We used 30 texts from 1990 to 2020 to explore how technologies have been and are currently being used to help learners develop their proficiency with suprasegmental features. Based on our thematic analysis, a persistent gap still exists between ASR-equipped software available to participants in research studies and what is available to university and classroom teachers and students. Additionally, there seems to be more development in the production of speech software for language assessment. In contrast, the translation of these tools into instructional tools for individualized learning seems to be almost non-existent. Moving forward, we recommend that more commercialized pronunciation systems utilizing ASR should be made publicly available using the technologies that are currently developed or are in development for the purposes of oral proficiency judgments.",

The main objective of the present study is to report the challenges and affordances of technologies used for computer-assisted vocabulary learning (CAVL), as described in current literature. A systematic review was conducted, and the results were visualized in a hierarchical data model. Following a rigorous screening process, 97 peer-reviewed articles published from 2014 to 2020 were selected from major related databases. Theoretically, the findings inform researchers about the reported limitations and advantages of computer-assisted L2 vocabulary learning and serve as a road map for future research directions. Pedagogically, the findings provide L2 teachers with an instruction manual to inform their practice, allowing them to benefit from the reported affordances of CAVL and take measures to address the reported challenges.",

However, previous research has relied primarily on participants' qualitative opinions, leading to a lack of studies empirically assessing how VR impacts anxiety and, consequently, second language (L2) oral production. This pilot study addresses these gaps by exploring how VR influences the self-reported and physiological FLA and oral comprehensibility of 25 L2 French learners. Participants completed four comparable interpersonal consensus building tasks over eight weeks: two in the social VR application, vTime XR\u2122, and two in a traditional classroom. Immediately following each task, participants self-assessed their anxiety. Moreover, a subsample of participants' self-reported anxiety data was complemented with a physiological indicator of anxiety, salivary cortisol, to evaluate using this biomarker in FLA research. Participants' speech for all tasks was rated by four native French speakers for comprehensibility. Descriptive statistics are presented. Self-reported anxiety and cortisol data indicated that participants were less anxious in VR and throughout the eight weeks. A positive correlation was found between self-reported and cortisol data, indicating consistency between these two anxiety measures. Finally, raters found participants to be more comprehensible in VR and when they self-reported lower anxiety.",

    "description": "Studies on digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) have increased in numbers, creating a pool of studies that can be meta-analyzed to measure the overall effect of digital gaming on second language (L2) development. The current meta-analysis targets digital games that were available to the public at the time of data collection, January of 2020, aggregating their effects on L2 development overall and across a number of moderator variables. These moderator variables include the game developers' intended purpose of the game (educational or entertainment), outcome measures (e.g., vocabulary, overall proficiency), and several game design features such as the type of player interaction (single player, multiplayer, massively multiplayer online), among others. Results indicate that DGBLL has had a small to medium positive effect (Cohen's d[subscript weighted] = 0.50) for between-groups designs and a medium effect (d[subscript weighted] = 0.95) for within-group designs. Games designed for entertainment were found to be more effective than those designed for L2 education, although there is some overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two groups. The overall findings and those from additional moderator analyses are discussed in light of previous DGBLL findings while offering direction for future research and recommendations for improving the methodological rigor and transparency in DGBLL research.",

    "description": "To the extent automated written corrective feedback (AWCF) tools such as Grammarly are based on sophisticated error-correction technologies, such as machine-learning techniques, they have the potential to find and correct more common L2 error types than simpler spelling and grammar checkers such as the one included in Microsoft Word (technically known as MS-NLP). Moreover, AWCF tools can deliver feedback synchronously, although not instantaneously, as often appears to be the case with MS-NLP. Cognitive theory and recent L2 research suggest that synchronous corrective feedback may aid L2 development, but also that error-flagging at suboptimal times could cause disfluencies in L2 students' writing processes. To contribute to the knowledge needed for appropriate application of this new genre of writing-support technology, we evaluated Grammarly's capacity to address common L2 problem areas, as well as issues with its feedback-delivery timing, using MS-NLP as a benchmark. Grammarly was found to flag 10 times as many common L2 error types as MS-NLP in the same corpus of student texts while also displaying an average 17.5-second delay in feedback delivery, exceeding the distraction-potential threshold defined for the L2 student writers in our sample. Implications for the use of AWCF tools in L2 settings are discussed.",

Building on L2 acquisition theories and chatbot research, in this article, we report on a South Korean government-funded longitudinal project in which we designed and developed a chatbot called &quot;Ellie&quot;. Chatbot Ellie has three chat modes, &quot;General Chat,&quot; &quot;Task Chat,&quot; and &quot;Skills&quot;. In the General Chat mode, L2 users can have short talks about personal information, whereas in the Task Chat mode, they can engage in a wide range of problem-solving L2 tasks to achieve task goals by exchanging meanings with Ellie. The Skills mode offers form-focused language practice. Ellie was piloted among 137 Korean high school students, who used Ellie individually or in a group, for seven weeks in their English classes. The quality of the chatbot was investigated in terms of the appropriateness of language level, continuity of conversation, and success in task performance. Based on the results of the pilot, Ellie appears to have considerable potential to become an effective language learning companion for L2 learners, and has implications for the design and developments of future L2 chatbots.",

While a variety of factors have been identified as influencing their effectiveness in facilitating uptake and L2 development (e.g., learners' age and level of proficiency), the role of mode of interaction has been the object of relatively little research. To fill this gap, the current study explored the impact of mode of interaction on learners' successful uptake and L2 gains when recasts are provided. Sixty young Greek EFL learners (M = 11.39 years old, SD = 0.86) were assigned to one of two experimental conditions that differed as to whether students engaged in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) or face-to-face (FTF) interaction. Both groups performed information transmission tasks that required them to provide information about habits of fictional characters. In both conditions, the participants received interrogative, partial recasts addressing errors on the present third person singular. The recasts were oral in the FTF condition and written in the SCMC condition. L2 development was gauged by an oral and a written production test. Results demonstrated that oral recasts in the FTF mode generated more successful uptake and they led to more L2 gains than written recasts in the SCMC condition on both outcome measures.",

    "description": "This paper presents the results of a brief mixed-methods intervention which sought to modify the production of prominence-related features in L2 English by four native French-speaking university lecturers, in read-aloud speech. Selected parts of participants' productions were acoustically modified and then used as the model in a Listen-and-Repeat protocol, where both quantitative (acoustic measures) and qualitative (free comments from discussion) data were collected. Acoustic measures were taken again from productions realized three months after the protocol, to trace longer term retention of modifications; expert listeners compared a selection of these productions to the original, diagnostic renditions, rating the degree of nativelike rhythm and melody. Analysis of the quantitative and qualitative results confirm that imitating oneself can help individuals to modify prominence-related features of their pronunciation, that such changes can be retained over a 3-month period, but that people cannot reliably judge what they have modified. New potential is thus shown for Listen-and-Repeat, using one's own modified voice, as an effective technique in pronunciation instruction.",

Findings confirmed that technology-integrated instruction produced a positive, medium effect size (ES = 0.47) on literacy outcome as compared to traditional methods where no technology was involved. Moderator analyses were conducted with eight study features: grade level, learning context, study duration, intensity per week, total contact time, literacy outcome, pedagogical use, and teaching method. Learning context and literacy outcomes were found to be statistically significant to explain the variance of the effect sizes between the studies. These results advocate for the use of educational technology in literacy instruction for ELLs, regardless of literacy outcomes, pedagogical use, teaching methods, learning contexts, and grade levels.

    "description": "Online platforms have the potential to address the issue of world language teacher attrition by building professional learning communities. However, autonomous engagement is not guaranteed by the mere existence of said tools. In this article, we report findings from Catalyst user data analysis. Catalyst is an online professional development social portfolio that connects users to other professionals (in groups and as individuals). Specifically, we examine user behavior patterns in six areas--Group Membership, Goals, Evidence, Connections, Reflections, and Comments. Each feature was chosen because of its potential usefulness in facilitating meaningful and integrative participation in online professional platforms. Results reveal three behavior profiles: 1-Testers, 2-Dabblers, and 3-Embracers. Each profile exhibits unique behaviors of engagement with the portfolio. Users who did not join any group were much more likely to show the lowest level of activity (i.e., Testers), while those who were part of a group and had more connections (i.e., Embracers) demonstrated the highest level of activity. These results support the theoretical foundation for sociocultural approaches to professional learning for teachers (e.g., Kabilan et al., 2011; Kabilan &amp; Kahn, 2012; Kitade, 2014) and highlight the critical, and mutually reciprocal, relationship between social engagement and cognitive development.",

The study was conducted in an English for academic purposes (EAP) course at a Hong Kong university that had already implemented blended learning for several years. Adopting an analytics-based approach, 469,286 data logs in a learning management system were analyzed to measure students' engagement and their respective self-directed behavior. The retrieved student data covered the time both before and during the pandemic. Our findings reveal that students were primarily engaged for assessment purposes; however, those in the pandemic cohort demonstrated better self-directed behavior, such as early and regular engagement. Although the results indicated a relatively strong association between student engagement and course outcomes, the students during the pandemic seem to have managed their learning more effectively.",

    "description": "The information literacy practices of adolescents on social media outside of school are worth considering, since adolescents use social media near ubiquitously and must grapple with all types of content they encounter incidentally or intentionally. This scoping review followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to examine the extent and nature of scholarship on this topic from the perspective of educational technology and literacy scholarship, as both fields are uniquely poised to collaborate on this interdisciplinary topic. Surprisingly, only four articles fit the scope of our review. The literature found, and not found, revealed several themes. These themes were the imprecise use of keywords across scholarship, use of social media for community support, exposure to incidental information, evidence for different literacy practices on social media, and the need for addressing social media information literacy in school. Opportunities for future work and collaborative research between both fields is also discussed.",

    "description": "The expansion of MOOCs (massive open online courses) is very much associated with instructors interested in the craft of teaching, innovating, and experimenting with different methods to improve and expand students' learning experience. The Erasmus+ project MOONLITE has worked to create cross-institutional scenarios and new educational pathways for migrants and refugees, devising, among other things, two Spanish language MOOCs (LMOOCs). They are the product of the joint efforts of university academics, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and refugee support groups (RSGs), together with volunteers, refugees, and migrants, who formed a community in order to design courses that effectively addressed the needs of refugees and migrants arriving in Spain. Using a design thinking process, all parties involved attempted to collaboratively identify strategies and solutions to a given problem that might not be obvious upon first inspection; in this case, the specific linguistic needs of migrants and refugees arriving in a new country. Results show that this continuum of academics--NGOs/RSGs--volunteers--refugees/migrants was highly effective for the learners, with an overall completion rate in both MOOCs of 96%. The participants' perception is that these MOOCs helped them in their goal of integrating into life in Spain in key situations, such as communicating in a job interview or understanding the process of looking for accommodation and completing bureaucratic procedures.",

    "title": "The Effects of Pre-Task Planning on EFL Learners&apos; Oral Performance in a 3D Multi-User Virtual Environment",
    "author": "Chen, Julian ChengChiang",
    "description": "Prior research on pre-task planning examines its effects on the quality of second language (L2) learners' planned output. Planning mitigates the cognitive overload placed upon L2 learners' oral performance, thus improving language production. Despite the pedagogical benefits, studies on pre-task planning on L2 learners' oral output are conducted mostly in a lab or class setting. Whether or not similar effects of pre-task planning can be evidenced in three-dimensional (3D) multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs), such as Second Life (SL), is still less explored. Hence, this study investigates whether pre-task planning could enhance the quality and quantity of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' task-oriented, voice-based outcomes in SL. Nine EFL learners worldwide participated in this 10-session virtual class. Data were collected through students' oral presentations in performing real-life simulated tasks related to their home cultures and interests. Yuan and Ellis's (2003) framework of T-units measures was adopted to analyze their linguistic performance measured by complexity and accuracy. Results indicated that EFL learners showed statistically significant improvement on grammatical complexity on the levels of syntactic complexity and variety (but not on lexical variety) and on linguistic accuracy across all measured levels (error-free clauses/T-units/verb forms). It is suggested that pre-task planning can be seeded in task-based instruction either in a classroom-based or 3D MUVE setting to optimize the quality of learners' linguistic performance. Tasks that are real-world oriented and targeting learners' cultural repertoires and world knowledge also positively impact their virtual learning experiences. These significant implications add new research and pedagogical dimensions to the field of computer-assisted language learning.",

To elicit their tool consultation behaviors, a vocabulary test with collocation questions was designed. The students' use of the tool to answer the vocabulary questions was screen-recorded for further analysis, serving as the major data source. One-on-one interviews with selected students were then conducted to clarify issues related to the study and their experience in using the tool. The findings indicated that the pattern-based tool was efficient in helping students solve collocation problems.

Students' zone of actual and proximal development is observed through the use of a grammar and vocabulary level test and the use of the WhatsApp application respectively. Sixty students taking a B1 English course at the language centre of a Spanish university were studied. A mixed methods methodology was used to analyse the differences between two pre-existing groups (control and experimental), each consisting of 30 participants. Both groups received the same tuition and content, and students in the experimental group participated in a daily conversation in the application during a five-month period where negative feedback was provided by the teacher through the use of an inventory of prompts, from most implicit to most explicit. Throughout the research, pedagogical mobile-mediated DA became a central part of the students' learning process, extending learning beyond the in-class time and becoming a constant source of L2 input and feedback. Moreover, results indicated that DA and dialogic mediation helped students reflect on their language performance, gradually requiring less explicit feedback and metalinguistic explanations.",

    "description": "This study explores interactions among language learners with the support of online resources in a collaborative writing task and how online resources assisted collaborating learners in the meaning-making process. The study was conducted in the freshman English course at a national university in Taiwan. Fifty-six students constructed an essay in pairs firstly &quot;without&quot; the support of online resources, and subsequently constructed another essay &quot;with&quot; the support of online resources. Each pair's interactional patterns and dynamics of peer scaffolding across the two settings were examined. The findings show that the availability of online resources fosters a variety of interaction characteristics among learners with varied collaboration orientation. Results also suggest that learners' collaboration predisposition at the onset plays a critical role in influencing the way they used online resources to support their interaction. This study thus suggests that learners' collaborative patterns and their use of online resources have mutual impact, which may inform teachers seeking to integrate online resources to enhance their students' collaborative learning.",

    "description": "This exploratory study examined the potential connections between informal digital learning of English (IDLE), strategic competence for cross-cultural communication and perception of varieties of English. A total of 266 Korean EFL university students, who had no overseas experience, filled in a questionnaire survey. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were also carried out to complement the quantitative data. Results of structural equation modelling showed that perception of varieties of English mediated the relationship between IDLE and strategic competence for cross-cultural communication. The qualitative data also confirmed that EFL students without overseas experience tended to adopt more effective cross-cultural communication strategies when their perception of different varieties of English became more positive through their engagement in IDLE activities. These results can offer pedagogical insights into how ELT researchers and teachers can better prepare contemporary English learners for cross-cultural interactions in multicultural environments, whether in digital or face-to-face milieus.",

    "description": "This study examines the impact of group composition (one-on-one vs. multiple-to-multiple) and task design (student-selected vs. teacher-assigned) on undergraduate foreign language learners' interactions in a mobile-based intercultural exchange. The participants, 27 Korean students learning English as a foreign language and 27 American students learning Korean as a foreign language, interacted in pairs and groups via mobile phones to complete weekly tasks for eight weeks. This study used mixed methods to analyze the data from mobile chat scripts, questionnaires, and interviews. The results indicated that the one-on-one and multiple-to-multiple groups did not differ significantly regarding contact frequency or number of written chats. However, one-on-one and multiple-to-multiple interactions did differ with regard to the quality of the interactions, reflecting the unique nature of each group composition. A one-on-one relationship promoted a higher level of intimacy and friendship, thus rendering it appropriate for providing linguistic and emotional support in learning foreign languages. In contrast, multiple-to-multiple communications were found to be more beneficial for learning about different perspectives on the target cultures. In terms of task design, teacher-assigned tasks guided students to engage in productive interactions effectively, whereas student-selected tasks elicited their personal investment in the tasks. Supporting social interdependence theory (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989, 2009), we argue that the establishment of intimate relationships among group members may be the key to quality interactions in mobile-based intercultural exchanges.",

    "description": "A vocabulary acquisition learning activity was designed and a learning system featuring image-to-text recognition technology to support the activity was developed. The effectiveness of the system with regard to facilitating vocabulary acquisition was tested. The perceptions of learners toward this tool and the affordances of the system for vocabulary acquisition were also explored. To this end, we designed an experiment in which 40 native speakers of Russian learning English as a foreign language from an elementary school participated. They were assigned to either a control condition or an experimental condition. All learners learned new vocabulary in class and then applied their new knowledge to contexts with a realistic simulation of the real world by completing a learning task. The learners in the control group used a traditional approach (e.g. the learners learned vocabulary from corresponding pictures in a textbook), whereas the learners in the experimental group used the proposed learning system (e.g. the learners learned vocabulary using the system). A pre-test-post-test/delayed post-test design was employed to test the effectiveness of the treatment on vocabulary acquisition. Learner perceptions and perceived affordances of the system for vocabulary acquisition were explored through a questionnaire survey and interviews. The quantitative results showed that the learners in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts on both the vocabulary post-test and delayed post-test. The qualitative results revealed that most learners in the experimental group had positive perceptions of the system. In addition, the qualitative results showed the three main categories of affordances. Based on these results, several suggestions and implications are provided for the teaching and research community.",

    "author": "Peeters, Ward, Pretorius, Marilize",
    "description": "Creating collaborative working and learning experiences has long been at the forefront of computer-assisted language learning research. It is in this context that, in recent years, the integration of social networking sites and Web 2.0 in learning settings has surged, generating new opportunities to establish and explore virtual communities of practice (VCoPs). However, despite the number of studies on the concept, research remains inconclusive on how learners develop a sense of community in a VCoP, and what effect this may have on interaction and learning. This research project proposes to use social network analysis, part of graph theory, to explore the configuration of a set of VCoPs, and presents an empirical approach to determine how interaction in such communities takes shape. The present paper studies the concept of &quot;community&quot; in two VCoPs on Facebook. Participants (Group 1: N = 123, Group 2: N = 34) in both VCoPs are enrolled in English as a foreign language courses at two Belgian institutions of higher education. Social network analysis is used to show how both learner groups establish and develop a network of peers, and how different participants in those groups adopt different roles. Participation matrices reveal that interaction mainly revolves around a number of active key figures and that certain factors such as the incorporation of online and offline assignments and the inclusion of a teacher online result in varying levels of success when establishing collaborative dialogue within the VCoPs. Recommendations are formulated to inform and improve future practice.",

    "description": "How can state-of-the-art computational linguistic technology reduce the workload and increase the efficiency of language teachers? To address this question, we combine insights from research in second language acquisition and computational linguistics to automatically generate text-based questions to a given text. The questions are designed to draw the learner's attention to target linguistic forms -- phrasal verbs, in this particular case -- by requiring them to use the forms or their paraphrases in the answer. Such questions help learners create form-meaning connections and are well suited for both practice and testing. We discuss the generation of a novel type of question combining a &quot;wh&quot;- question with a gapped sentence, and report the results of two crowdsourcing evaluation studies investigating how well automatically generated questions compare to those written by a language teacher. The first study compares our system output to gold standard human-written questions via crowdsourcing rating. An equivalence test shows that automatically generated questions are comparable to human-written ones. The second crowdsourcing study investigates two types of questions (&quot;wh&quot;- questions with and without a gapped sentence), their perceived quality, and the responses they elicit. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of creating and evaluating question-generation systems for language learners.",

    "title": "The Monolingual Problem of Computer-Assisted Language Learning",
    "author": "Buendgens-Kosten, Judith",
    "description": "This paper sets out to discuss the monolingual problem within computer-assisted language learning (CALL) research and CALL product development, namely a lack of knowledge about how CALL products and projects can support learners in using all their linguistic resources to achieve language-learning- and language-using-related goals, and a lack of CALL products and projects that realize this potential, or that support specific plurilingual skill development. It uses an analysis of CALL-related papers to demonstrate how far CALL is impacted by a monolingual bias that it inherited from language learning pedagogy. An analysis of articles from four CALL journals across 10 years shows that although the words &quot;bilingual&quot; and &quot;multilingual&quot; appear in these journals fairly regularly, terms such as &quot;plurilingual, third language, tertiary language, L3, translanguaging,&quot; and &quot;translingual&quot; are extremely rare. Also, only eight articles could be identified that use any of these eight keywords in their title. Trends across those papers are identified. In a discussion of existing CALL products and projects that incorporate more than one language, it is argued that while commercial products often include more than one language, this is frequently in a behaviorist or grammar-translation tradition, while innovative plurilingual products and projects tend to be non-commercial and often EU/EC-funded initiatives. The article argues that CALL research and product development can not only avoid this monolingual bias, but also actively contribute to our knowledge of how all linguistic resources can be used for language learning. It makes suggestions for relevant future research areas related to multilingual computer-assisted language learning (MCALL).",

    "description": "Captioned video is widely used to enhance second language (L2) learners' exposure to oral input beyond the classroom setting, and captioning has been found to provide an instantaneous, useful visual aid for parsing and understanding L2 oral discourse. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis has shown that captioning exerts a selective effect on L2 learners with different profiles. This study investigated whether L2 learners' modality preferences (visual vs. auditory) and working memory capacity (high vs. low) would modulate the effect of full captions on L2 listening outcome. Results from 60 participants revealed that both cognitive variables affected their L2 listening to different extents. Notably, working memory capacity modulates the impact of L2 learners' preferred modality on their listening outcome. Modality preference did not exert any significant impact on the listening outcome of L2 learners with lower working memory capacity. For L2 learners with high working memory capacity, their modality preference played a pivotal role in modulating their listening outcome; in this case, auditory learners had the best listening performance viewing the video without captions, whereas visual learners did best when watching the captioned video. These findings speak to the need for taking individual differences into consideration when employing captioned videos.",

    "description": "Research into the multimodal aspects of language is increasingly important as communication through a screen plays a greater role in modern society than ever before (Liou, 2011). Multimodality has been explored from a number of angles relating to computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as its affordances and impact on language learners, highlighting its relevance and importance in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Because CMC scenarios require attending to both peers and the screen, learners can be seen as positioned as &quot;semiotic initiators and responders&quot; (Coffin &amp; Donohue, 2014). Increasingly, researchers are highlighting a need for a methodological &quot;turn&quot; to analyse this scenario from a &quot;language&quot; focus to a more holistic understanding of the interactions (Flewitt, 2008; Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006; Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Lamy, 2006). Along these lines, this case study explores how the action of task completion is mediated between six dyads (and individuals within the dyads) during an online peer-to-peer audioconferencing event. Drawing on notions from multimodal (inter)actional analysis (Norris, 2004, 2006) and the notion of &quot;semiotic initiators and responders&quot;, it investigates semiotic mediation with screen-based resources through analysis of audio recordings, screenshots, log files, task simulation and reconstruction. Results highlight oral and screen-based initiations and responses that take place during task completion, which is presented as a framework.",

They are judged sufficiently representative to enable broad trends to be detected and the sector's strengths and weaknesses to be identified. The focus is on CALL research's international reach, the range of topics researched and the nature of the studies themselves. The findings suggest that CALL research is growing internationally in the number of countries and researchers involved. A wide range of topics is researched, but there is a concentration of papers published on a cluster of popular areas. Consequently, fewer articles are published on a large number of CALL topics or, in some cases, rarely studied. The research methods employed are rigorous: in writing, structure, theory, literature awareness, and discussion and presentation of results, yet there are still weaknesses. Most empirical studies are small scale: based on one institution, a small cohort of students, over a short period of time and seldom followed up. Based on these findings, suggestions are made with a view to broadening and strengthening CALL research through targeting neglected strategic areas with special journal issues and conferences, and improving the quality of research projects. Key areas for future research are proposed.",

During a 15-week semester, 16 Korean EFL students enrolled in an introductory educational technology course played online games, visited gaming sites, and completed instructional tasks. Conceptualizing games as social practices and drawing from the bridging activities framework (Thorne &amp; Reinhardt, 2008), instructional tasks were designed to enhance language awareness and to present possibilities for socialization into gaming discourses. The study investigated the ways that the designed pedagogy supported or impeded language awareness and gaming discourse participation. The study found that the students exhibited language awareness in many ways, but that there were missed opportunities in developing student understandings of language as a social medium. Additionally, six students (38%) directly participated in gaming spaces, and some of them took on more central roles in gaming practices over time. Other students, however, did not attempt to directly participate in gaming sites or were not successful in their attempts. These findings are discussed in regard to pedagogical design, including game selection and supporting learner analyses of gaming discourses, as well as avenues for future research examining socialization in classrooms and gaming spaces.",

    "description": "Since advances in computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have made virtual exchanges readily available in educational practices, telecollaboration has been gaining traction as a means to provide practical experiences and cultural exposure to language learners and, more recently, teacher trainees. Drawing upon Byram's (1997) model of intercultural communicative competence (ICC), this study examines 48 teacher trainees' interculturality through a telecollaborative project between two teacher training classes from Turkey and the USA. This study relies on data generated by the participants throughout this telecollaborative project: weekly online discussion board posts within groups of six and post-project reflections. Although developing ICC is an arduous and prolonged task, the data analysis suggested that the participants' experiences in this telecollaboration contributed to their emergent ICC through discussions on the topics of multicultural education and interactions with trainees from another educational context. Their intercultural learning is evidenced by their (1) awareness of heterogeneity in their own and interactants' culture, (2) nascent critical cultural awareness, and (3) curiosity and willingness to learn more about the other culture. Thus, this study implies that telecollaboration offers an effective teacher training venue that affords teacher trainees with first-hand intercultural encounters to engage with otherness and prepare for their ethnolinguistically diverse classrooms.",

    "description": "In a poll (ReImagineEdu, 2016) looking at the digital profile of nearly 1,000 learners, it was reported that 78% of students worry about digital technologies distracting them from study. In attempting to contribute to this emerging debate (Aaron &amp; Lipton, 2018), this article investigates the experiences, perceptions and awareness of undergraduate language learners (n = 215, over a 3-year period) of the distractive nature of technology and the discerned impact upon their own student language learning and performance. The study is based on data gathered from university language students engaged in a specific language technology module. The module, interalia, sought to develop awareness of the time spent online by participants while using a number of resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed to conduct this research where qualitative and quantitative data emerged respectively from individual student blogs, reflective reports of their blogging experiences, group interviews and questionnaires. Our outcomes reveal a severe lack of student awareness on the final amount of time they spent online, this being due to a number of factors. However, there is some awareness and perception on their part of how heavily disruptive technology can be for their language learning. Our final conclusions include several recommendations and propose a deictic critical digital literacy for dealing with such distractions -- we are calling this a strategic agentive literacy.",

    "author": "Dooly, Melinda, Sadler, Randall",
    "description": "This article presents a pedagogical design for teacher education that combines flipped materials, in-class instruction, and telecollaboration (also known as virtual exchange) for foreign language teacher education. The context of this study is a course on technology and language learning for future teachers in which the flipped classroom concept was applied to technology-infused collaborative teacher training between future ESL/EFL instructors located at two partner universities (one in the USA, one in Europe). The three main teaching approaches (flipped materials, in class, and telecollaborative, or &quot;FIT&quot;) were symbiotic in that each structure reinforced the other through reception, discussion, and reflection as a means to help the student teachers bridge the gap between theory and practice. We apply classroom ethnographic discourse analysis to data sources (face-to-face and online discussion groups, student e-portfolios) to look at uptake of ideas, conceptual understanding, and successful transfer of new knowledge, and thereby identify whether the design provides significant learning opportunities for the future teachers. Although most studies of telecollaboration in language teacher education look principally at output, this approach allows an in-depth look at the learning process as knowledge is developed collaboratively between the participants.",

    "author": "Chang, You-Hsuan",
    "description": "In foreign language learning, computer-mediated dictionaries are among the most popular tools, and ambiguity tolerance (AT) is a key impact factor. However, few studies have focused on the effects of AT on computer-mediated dictionary-assisted English learning. To fill this gap, the current study explored the differences between two groups (a high AT group with 20 participants, and a low AT group with 21 participants) in learning processes (time spent on learning and dictionary usage) and learning performance (vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension) during computer-mediated dictionary-assisted English learning. The correlation between AT and another important variable in dictionary-assisted learning, vocabulary size, was also explored. The results showed that low AT learners had better performance in reading comprehension, even though low AT learners and high AT learners had similar learning processes and performance in vocabulary acquisition. In addition, there was no correlation between AT during English learning and vocabulary size. This study may be of importance in explaining the unique role AT plays in learning English with computer-mediated dictionary assistance. Finally, the current article proposes suggestions for future studies and discusses implications for foreign language teaching and learning.",

    "author": "Shadiev, Rustam, Huang, Yueh-Min",
    "description": "In this study, we applied speech-enabled language translation (SELT) during lectures in a foreign language. The SELT program received input from the instructor's speech and generated translated texts that were shown to students during lectures. We tested the feasibility of our approach specifically with regard to how it facilitates student attention and meditation. In addition, we assessed student perceived cognitive load and satisfaction during lectures with SELT support. To this end, we hired sixty students who attended lectures in English as a foreign language. The students were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Control group 1, with students who learned lecture content with no support, (2) Control group 2, with students for whom transcriptions in the instructional language (i.e. English as a foreign language) were shown during lectures, and (3) the Experimental group, with students for whom SELT-texts (i.e. translated transcriptions from English into the students' native language) were shown during lectures. We compared the attention, meditation, and perceived cognitive load of the students in the three groups and found that the SELT-texts were the most beneficial for student learning. When the SELT-texts were presented, student attention and meditation levels were the highest compared to those of the students in the other two groups. In addition, students perceived lower cognitive load during lectures in a foreign language with SELT support. Finally, the students were satisfied with their learning experience when SELT-texts were presented. Based on our results, several implications are drawn, and suggestions are provided.",

    "description": "Second/foreign language (L2) classrooms do not always provide opportunities for input and output practice [Lightbown, P. M. (2000). Classroom SLA research and second language teaching. Applied Linguistics, 21(4), 431-462]. The use of smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and its associated voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant (IPA) Alexa can help address this limitation because of its ability to extend the reach of the classroom, motivate practice, and encourage self-learning. Our previous study on the pedagogical use of Echo revealed that its use gave L2 learners ample opportunities for stress-free input exposure and output practice [Moussalli, S., &amp; Cardoso, W. (2016). Are commercial 'personal robots' ready for language learning? Focus on second language speech. In S. Papadima-Sophocleous, L. Bradley, &amp; S. Thou\u00ebsny (Eds.), CALL communities and culture -- short papers from EUROCALL 2016 (pp. 325-329). However, the results also suggested that beginner learners, depending on their levels of accentedness, experienced difficulties interacting with and being understood by Echo. Interestingly, this observation differs from findings involving human-to-human interactions, which suggest that a speaker's foreign accent does not impede intelligibility. In this article, we report the results of a study that investigated Echo's ability to recognize and process non-native accented speech at different levels of accentedness, based on the accuracy of its replies for a set of pre-established questions. Using a variety of analytical methods (i.e. judges' ratings of learners' pronunciation, learners' ratings of Echo's pronunciation, transcriptions of Echo's interactions, surveys and interviews) and via a multidimensional analysis of the data collected, our results indicate that L2 learners have no problems understanding Echo and that it adapts well to their accented speech (Echo is comparable to humans in terms of comprehensibility and intelligibility). Our results also show that L2 learners use a variety of strategies to mitigate the communication breakdown they experienced with Echo.",

    "description": "In many English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts, learning is often limited to decontextualized classroom learning, and students suffer from lack of interaction and authentic opportunities for language learning. One of the recent emerging technologies, context-aware augmented reality (AR) technology can mitigate this problem for EFL classrooms. In the present study, 40 college students created scenes of gamified digital stories on a location-based AR app and shared them with other students. This study investigated how the students used the physical context and properties in their scenes and how the technology facilitated language learning. Data were collected from student learning outcomes, post-surveys, and reflection papers. The results showed that the students employed context in three different ways, a real place, a fictional setting and a blended reality, and then integrated it with their content and transformed it into a co-constructed meaning-making site. The study also discovered that the technology supported the students' language learning in the affective, cognitive, and social domains. All elements found in the three domains were interrelated and ultimately contributed to student learning.",

    "description": "It is evident that teachers' and students' perceptions of interactions on Facebook directly relate to the utilization of Facebook regarding not only an interactional tool but also a learning and teaching environment. However, not many studies appeared on English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' interactions with their students on Facebook, specifically in the Turkish EFL context. This descriptive research aims to examine the level of EFL teachers' interactions with their students on the social networking service, Facebook, along with the differences between certain variables and the utilization of Facebook as an interactional tool. The sample group consists of 146 EFL teachers who work at public schools in Turkey. A background questionnaire and a survey which contained 46 items to investigate the level of teachers' interactions on Facebook and their perceptions of their students were administered to the sample group. The frequencies, mean scores and standard deviations were calculated. To analyze the relationship between certain variables and survey items, t-test and ANOVA were used. The results indicated that teachers preferred passive behaviors when interacting with their students on Facebook. Furthermore, they had the perception that their students preferred passive behaviors while interacting on Facebook as well. In addition, the findings showed that their interaction levels significantly differed in accordance with gender, school types, graduate degrees, and time spent on Facebook which consequently affected some items in the survey. The study suggests that EFL teachers should create a positive environment for interaction on Facebook to support their learners' personal and academic development.",

Analyses of students' questionnaires before the intervention and at the end of the second semester, observations of students' study behavior during the second semester, and students' academic performances during the two semesters were collected. At the end of the study period, students of the experimental group reported cramming less, using more learning techniques, redoing exercises with answers covered, and spacing repetitions more often instead of massing. Students' online study behavior verified their answers to the questionnaire and showed a more efficient use of the learning platforms. Students also benefited from this intervention by scoring higher in the final proficiency test of the second semester.",

In particular, the study aimed to examine the experiences of two English language teachers as they grappled with and managed the changes brought about by their involvement in the implementation of a blended learning curriculum. Data collection methods included narrative interviews and field notes from classroom observation. Findings indicate that switching to blended learning is a complex enterprise that goes beyond 'getting the mix right', as multiple individual and institutional factors come to shape teachers' implementation experiences. Depending on the extent to which their aspirations, beliefs and actions are aligned to the expectations of influential others and the culture of the organization, teachers can find it more or less difficult to perform stable professional identities and develop ownership of their practice. This study highlights the importance of considering ways in which tensions can be both managed and used as reflective opportunities to help teachers and change leaders implement BL programs more effectively.",

    "description": "Despite the prevalence of digital gaming as a leisure activity and research attesting to the affordances of digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) for English as a foreign language (EFL), the use of DGBLL remains low, especially outside the United States. A survey was carried out in order to understand both the beliefs and behaviors of pre-service EFL teachers in Germany regarding DGBLL. Utilizing constructs from a variety of instruments, students were asked about their prior experience with digital media for language learning, their perceived language skills and language learning strategies, their digital game playing behaviors, their digital language learning behaviors, and their beliefs regarding DGBLL. The results demonstrate that the cohort engages in limited DGBLL despite holding generally positive beliefs about the activity. While favorable beliefs were found to be inversely related to prior experience in formal school settings, current engagement in game playing affects perceived English language skills and language learning strategies positively. These findings have significant implications for EFL teacher education as regards DGBLL and further illuminate the habits and attitudes of so-called &quot;digital natives.&quot;",

This article reports a research project which investigated how metropolitan youth in Indonesia were using English online, how this related to their global motivation to learn English, and in particular how it related to their attitudes to classroom English lessons. A mixed method design included a 56-item survey of students at a leading university (n = 308) and follow up interviews with four participants who showed different profiles of activity and motivation. Levels and type of online activity were broadly in line with findings in other contexts, with students favoring entertainment and self-instruction rather than socially-oriented activity; this correlated broadly with a positive attitude to classroom learning, but cluster analysis showed that some individuals exhibited a different pattern of response which was explored in interview. The article discusses ways in which teachers of learners at lower levels of proficiency, operating under major curriculum constraints, may integrate learners' online informal learning of English into their classroom practice, and how teacher educators might help them do this.",

The findings from the eye-tracking results indicate that the participants' fixations were similar on novel words accompanied by their L1 cues and those accompanied by their L2 cues. When comparing the participants' fixation on L1 and L2 cues, the findings show that the participants spent similar time on both types of cues. The use of L1 cues leads to a similar amount of acquisition of novel words when compared to the use of L2 cues. The study makes two contributions to research in language learning: Methodologically, the use of eye-tracking is discussed along with how it may be triangulated with other methods for studying language processing. Empirically, the study sheds light on how bilinguals process cues in their L1 and L2. Implications for future research and classroom practice are considered.",

Four instructors who were involved with the experimental group received training on the implementation of STADIBTM. Qualitative data collection and analysis were utilized. The argumentative essay pre-tests and post-tests along with pre-treatment and post-treatment surveys were used to collect data. The quantitative results were evaluated using ANCOVA analyses. The findings showed that only the less skilled participants of the experimental and control groups were able to significantly improve their argumentative writing.

Most studies on MT as a tool for L2 learning have focused on student postediting of the translation that MT provides; however, the present study employed a different design with students translating their L1 writing into L2 without the help of MT and then correcting their L2 writing using the MT translation for comparison. Text analysis of students' writing outcomes revealed that MT helped to decrease lexico-grammatical errors and improve student revisions. Using MT for revisions also positively affected student writing strategies and helped them think of writing as a process. The interviews and reflection papers demonstrated that students viewed the use of MT during writing positively. This study found that MT can be a useful aid to language learning, but for it to benefit student learning, teachers must be aware of its limitations and provide adequate guidance to students.",

As smartphones have become more available and affordable, educators and learners have looked at the potential these devices offer to extend language learning opportunities beyond the classroom. This study looked at how university English language learners engaged in student-led communicative tasks on an Multimedia Messaging Systems platform accessed through their smartphones. In designing the study, I took an interactionist perspective and used sociocultural theory as an analytical tool in my analysis. The results showed that learners successfully engaged in these tasks and that they found them useful as language learning activities. Although there was a low level of negotiation of meaning between peers, the participants were heavily involved in using affordances on their smartphones to help them engage in the tasks.",

This qualitative study examines how Colombian English pre-service teachers' telecollaboration with U.S. Spanish heritage language students (SHLSs) influences the Colombian future teachers' self-perceptions as (non) native speakers. This research joins the call scholars have made to expand telecollaboration into critical perspectives to challenge pervasive and harmful language beliefs and attitudes. Findings suggest that Colombian participants' cooperative relationships with U.S. peers provided them affective and knowledge-based resources to build more favorable views of themselves, attitudes to confront the detrimental effects of native-speakerism ideologies, and informed judgments to dismantle them.",

    "description": "The aim of this study is to examine the trends and main findings of the studies concerning the flipped classroom method in the field of English language teaching (ELT). For this purpose, databases including Web of Science, Eric, Taylor &amp; Francis and the Educational full text EBSCO were reviewed, and a total of 43 articles were analysed. Systematic review was used as the research methodology. The articles were analysed utilising a content analysis method. The findings of the study revealed that the flipped classroom method in ELT gained popularity among researchers after 2014, and the number of the studies in the field rapidly increased in the last two years (2016-2017). In addition, the most commonly used research methods in flipped classroom in ELT studies were found to be mixed and quantitative methods. In the examined studies, speaking and writing abilities were the most commonly studied language skills. Further analysis revealed challenges, as well as benefits related to the use of the flipped classroom method in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. Additionally, in studies reviewed concerning the effectiveness of the flipped classroom methods, the findings mostly pointed to the benefits of the flipped classroom method. On the basis of the review, various suggestions are made for practitioners and future research.",

The participants of this study are 382 university students taking part in a survey related to their perceptions of their self-directed, technology-enhanced language learning in addition to their experience of language learning at school and in private institutes. Parental income has been used as a proxy to the learners' SES. Their language outcome has been operationalised by their performance in the English section of the nation-wide entrance exam and their pre-university course. The results of path analysis revealed that EFL learners' SES is a significant predictor of their autonomous language learning with technology and their language achievement. Furthermore, students' out-of-class engagement with technology was positively associated with their performance in the English section of the nation-wide exam.",

The current study aimed to investigate learners' perceptions of collaborative digital graphic writing to revise assigned readings and lectures and to determine how collaborative digital graphic writing based on semantic mapping appealed to different learning styles as well as its possible contribution to learner retention of course content. The participants included EFL (English as a Foreign Language) seniors at a state university in Turkey. They practiced creating digital graphic organizers via a piece of software on the assigned readings and the lectures. The findings pointed out that digital graphic writing had unique characteristics for the revision of the assigned readings since utilizing both text and visuals supplied learners with an entertaining and creative medium for revising the concepts. Moreover, it was determined that collaborative digital graphic writing also provided a useful way to support retention of course content in addition to the opportunity to learn from each other's comments and suggestions.",

    "description": "This study introduces a new scale of willingness to communicate in a second language (L2 WTC) in digital and non-digital EFL contexts. The psychometric testing of the revised L2 WTC (L2 WTC-R) was undertaken with 114 Indonesian EFL students by means of exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results yielded an 11-item scale composed of three factors (&quot;L2 WTC inside the classroom,&quot; &quot;L2 WTC outside the classroom,&quot; and &quot;L2 WTC in the context of informal digital learning of English [IDLE]&quot;), with strong reliability and validity evidences. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was subsequently administered for a new sample (215 Indonesian EFL students), confirming the three-factor model that emerged from EFA. These results not only validate the existing L2 WTC scale but also expand its scale into digital settings, which will enable future research to consider another domain of L2 WTC (the IDLE context). From a real-world perspective, this can serve as a useful instrument for practitioners to gauge and foster L2 WTC levels in digital and non-digital contexts.",

    "description": "One of the more rapidly advancing subfields of second language acquisition research is Digital-game based language learning (DGBLL) and many studies have found that Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) games can have a positive effect on vocabulary acquisition. COTS games are specifically made for entertainment purposes, while serious games, which studies have found to enhance language and content knowledge, are designed for educational purposes. In the present study, a serious game titled Slave Trade was adopted to examine whether vocabulary and knowledge of history can be acquired at the same time and to investigate how the participants perceived the serious game regarding language and history learning. Sixty six college EFL students were recruited to take part in this study. They were required to take pre- and post-tests in both vocabulary and content knowledge and to respond to a user survey. The study found statistically significant improvements in both vocabulary and history knowledge. The vocabulary learning can mainly be attributed to the rich contextual clues of the gaming environment and repetitive exposure to the target words (i.e. more than six times). However, it was also found that words of fewer occurrences could be acquired because of the gaming environment. In addition, the students reported that they had enjoyed a positive learning experience via the serious game. Finally, it is suggested that language teachers should consider making educational use of serious games.",

    "description": "This qualitative case study investigates the technology-enhanced constructivist learning environment (CLE) for developing undergraduate English-majors' research abilities at a Chinese university. The faculty group attempted at transforming an English Writing course into BA Thesis Writing, supported by a free online learning management system (Moodle) with multi-faceted scenario, resources, tools and management. Situated in the broader context of the 10-year curriculum reform, two BA Thesis Writing classes from two semesters were examined using observation notes, interviews and student products. Findings show the CLE has enhanced the students' problem-based learning (PBL) processes and research ability development in terms of problem awareness, information literacy, reasoning and research designing. The CLE contributed to the whole learning experience by continuous instructional support, forum discussions, and information resources and tools. However, faculty tended to avoid teaching such a course because it is not only demanding but it clashes with norms of Chinese higher education in terms of professional values, pedagogical philosophy and institutional culture. The paper concludes by assessing the reform efforts' overall gains and challenges, and its implications for future technology integration in foreign language learning and teaching in China.",

    "description": "This study investigated how one type of learner-generated information and content, i.e. inter-group peer online feedback, provided on a wiki writing assignment for an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course, could contribute to student L2 writing. Using a mixed method approach, more than 1000 entries of online peer comments were collected, coded, analysed and compared with more than 400 comments provided by the course teacher, as shown in the marked final writing. Correlation and chi-square tests were employed to measure the relationship between the tabulated frequency of comments and essay scores. In addition, an online survey was carried out to collect student perspectives. The results show that (1) peers try to be friendly, supportive and avoid face threatening when providing online feedback in an open learning environment; (2) peer critical comments can predict well the final score received from the course teacher; (3) peer feedback focuses more on content/meaning rather than form (language) issues in EAP settings; (4) peer feedback contributes to EAP writing in various ways, both tangibly and affectively. It is suggested that more caution and thinking should be involved in designing the wiki learning environment judiciously by considering a number of factors that can prompt peers to provide appropriate and useful inter-group comments to help other groups improve their writing and L2 learning.",

As a method to address students' needs for twenty-first century education, the flipped classroom pedagogical approach was chosen to explore student attitudes towards technology for language learning in credit-bearing language courses in USA and Macau and non-credit-bearing courses in Colombia. This study implemented an experimental design with a mixed methods approach for data collection. Data was collected from a technology survey, focus group sessions, and reflective essays. Before each class, students in the experimental groups in all three countries previewed lessons and engaged in activities through online videos and screencasts in order to better prepare for in class activities. Results showed that the USA experimental group showed a statistically significant difference in all self-reported attitudes in using technology for language learning overtime. Between groups statistical analyses found flipped classrooms experienced a statistically significant different change in self-reported attitudes on instrumentality, digital literacy, and anxiety. Overall, students in the USA and Columbian contexts may have less anxiety about using technology for language learning in a flipped classroom, and the flipped classroom may positively impact students' attitudes towards technology in Columbia, Macau, and USA.",

A sample online comment thread was prepared to lead the participants to begin to observe and analyze online language before they collected their online comments to build their personal portfolios. It was found that the participants mainly resorted to Facebook (58.0%) and YouTube (35.8%) to find comments; 69.1% of their topics were related to news stories while the remaining can be categorized as entertainment and personal interests. Students reported to have learned the importance of taking responsibility for one's words online. In terms of knowledge, many students gained new knowledge about slang and world issues. They also felt that learning to read and evaluate online comments was an enjoyable and empowering experience. This study concludes with a few suggestions for future research to further investigate the potential benefits of incorporating online comments into language pedagogy.",

    "author": "Wu, Wen-Chi Vivian, Yang, Jie Chi, Scott Chen Hsieh, Jun, Yamamoto, Tosh",
    "description": "Motivation has played an essential role in learning, leading to various research areas across diverse disciplines. While the literature is replete with findings supporting the essentiality of motivation in an individual's academic success, demotivation (a.k.a. negative motivation) has been underexplored, even though it has been a widespread phenomenon observed in language learning, particularly in the field of English writing in EFL settings. To keep leaners motivated and engaged, innovative pedagogies have been proposed, among which flipped learning and writing instruction have received extra attention. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of flipped learning and online writing practices on enhancing student motivation and learning outcomes. Nonetheless, research on how the aforementioned instructional practices could be integrated to facilitate English writing among EFL learners still remains scarce, let alone a detailed probe into demotivational factors that might exist in such an innovative instructional design. Therefore, this study examined demotivation factors in EFL writing and the effects of the online flipped writing instruction on EFL writing proficiency. Forty-eight sophomore English-majors in Taiwan were paired with American college peers. Multiple sources of data over a semester included pre- and post-tests on two genres (descriptive/argumentative), 'Demotivation Scale', reflective journals, and interviews. The results revealed that the online flipped writing instruction enhanced the students' writing proficiency (both globally and locally), and that four characteristics of the flipped instruction were observed not to cause demotivation in English writing, including self-interest, classroom atmosphere and teaching material, writing product, and teaching method and content. The participants held positive perceptions about the online flipped writing instruction and such learning experience enhanced cross-cultural observation. Based on these findings, pedagogical implications are provided.",

    "description": "To ensure the successful implementation of technology in young learners' classroom, the significant role of teachers in the appropriate use of related technologies should be considered. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the attitude, knowledge, use, and challenges of English teachers of young learners to integrate technological tools into language classes. Survey data were collected from 95 young learner English language teachers working in language institutes and schools in Iran. The survey was comprised of four parts, namely technological tools questionnaire, teachers' attitude questionnaire, teachers' challenges questionnaire, and 11 open-ended questions. The results of the study revealed that there was a general positive tendency towards the integration of technology into young learner classes. The results also showed that most teachers did not have sufficient pedagogical and technological knowledge to use technology to teach the English language to young learners. The findings also revealed that a large number of teachers were not provided with training courses on the use of technology in young learners' classes; however, they were willing to participate in technology-based professional development programs. Limited computer facilities, teachers' lack of skills, and lack of support from schools and institutes were found to be the major challenges of using technology in young learners' classes. The findings of this study encourage other researchers to carry out more in-depth studies on the implementation of technological tools in language classes of young learners.",

    "description": "This study investigates the extent to which microfeatures -- such as basic text features, readability, cohesion, and lexical diversity based on specific word lists -- affect Chinese EFL writing quality. Data analysis was conducted using natural language processing, correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis on a corpus of 268 Chinese students' SAT writing in response to a single prompt. The results show that word count, the number of words per sentence, the connecting word frequency, the number of commas per sentence, the stop word frequency and the Coleman-Liau readability index (CLI) contribute significantly towards predicting SAT essay scores of Chinese EFL students. The regression model explains 62.6% of the variance in predicting the SAT essay's score where the number of commas per sentence acts as a suppressor. Surprisingly, none of the word lists were found to be a significant predictor. Consequently, EFL teachers can adopt these simple lexical features to formulate writing strategies for beginner level Chinese EFL students to improve their SAT writing quality. Moreover, developers can include these features as a personalized option in automated writing assistance systems targeted toward beginner level Chinese EFL students.",

    "description": "The aim of this article is to reveal the ways in which six 14- to 15-year-old second language (L2) learners, two each of high, mid, and low English proficiency levels were cognitively engaged in writing while using an automated content feedback program known as the Essay Critiquing System 2.0 in three out of five workshops in a Hong Kong secondary school. Through their video-recorded verbal reports and stimulated recalls, it was found that cognitive engagement was demonstrated by means of some composing strategies including questioning what and how to write, reading, reasoning and planning, making evaluative comments, and problem-solving strategies. Forty-eight strategies representing four types of mental activities, as well as six aspects of their writing were identified from the two sets of introspective data. Both sets of data showed that the three groups of adolescent language learners made mental efforts to complete their writing in their own ways. All of them were concerned with what to write most, followed by how to express themselves. Although the findings of the six case studies may not be generalizable, through introspections they indicate how the adolescent learners were stimulated to use the System and technology to help them enrich both content and language while writing. The introspective data also shed light on pedagogical implications regarding the use of the System or similar computer-assisted programs to assist writing. The present study contributes to the literature by enhancing our understanding of adolescent English learners' mental activities in a computer-assisted writing environment, an area which is not adequately researched.",

    "author": "Chi, Pham Kim, Loi, Nguyen Van",
    "description": "Online English language teaching can now be facilitated by communication technology, which allows easy access to interaction with native speakers. Nevertheless, this industry subscribes to an assumption that native speaker English teachers (NESTs) are the gold standard of language whereas the non-native speaker English teachers (NNESTs) are inferior educators (Walkinshaw &amp; Duong, 2014). Rare research has provided evidence of the negotiation produced by NESTs versus NNESTs with EFL learners online and its impact on the learners' output. Thus, the current study narrows this empirical gap. Drawing upon a database of 30 five-minute interaction sessions between 30 teachers (15 NESTs and 15 NNESTs) and 30 basic level Vietnamese EFL adult learners, the study revealed similar negotiation of meaning functions as reported in previous research. However, the NESTs used more elaboration while the NNESTs used more confirmation checks, clarification requests, and reply clarification. Qualitative analysis further indicated that the NNESTs provided more productive support, encouraging the learners' output, than the NESTs did. This implies that although online voice interaction creates an environment for EFL learners to practice, language educators and teachers, regardless of status, should heed how to handle it so that online learners can benefit from both comprehensible input and opportunities for pushed output.",

Robot programming may be used to attract students to programming, but the success of this technique is subjected to the availability of robots. Pair and collaborative programming allows students to learn from one another and write efficient programs. Assessment systems help instructors in evaluating programs written by students and provide them with timely feedback. Furthermore, an analysis of citations showed that Scratch is the most researched tool for teaching programming. We discuss how these techniques may be used to teach introductory courses, advanced courses, and massive open online courses on programming.",

    "description": "This study uses the log data from Moodle learning management system for predicting student learning performance in the first third of a semester. Since the quality of the data has great influence on the accuracy of machine learning, five major data transmission methods are used to enhance data quality of log file in the data preprocessing stage. Furthermore, the modified FRBCS-CHI (fuzzy rule-based classification system using Chi's technique) algorithm, based on the weighted consequence, is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of classification. Thereafter, the confusion matrix with two dimensions is employed to illustrate the prediction results, such as false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which are further used to produce the parameters of prediction performance, including the precision rate, the recall rate, and the F-measure. From the results of experiment, the proposed modified FRBCS-CHI method will have higher prediction accuracy than the original FRBCS-CHI method.",

Such languages present challenges to students possessed of alphabet-based mother tongues. To meet these challenges, we discuss a technology-enhanced learning method to address the needs of second language learners and support the development of appropriate logographic skills. Our novel approach facilitates the memorization of pictograms through the augmented method of loci. We detail augmented method of loci, discuss its wide impact in a range of disciplines, and provide a case study of its application.",

Although many academic units have also started blended learning, still a lot of them are stuck with old procedures. The sudden outbreak of a deadly disease called Covid-19 caused by a Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) shook the entire world. The World Health Organization declared it as a &quot;pandemic.&quot; This situation challenged the education system across the world and forced educators to shift to an online mode of teaching overnight. Many academic institutions that were earlier reluctant to change their traditional pedagogical approach had no option but to shift entirely to online teaching-learning. The article includes the importance of online learning and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, &amp; Challenges (SWOC) analysis of e-learning modes in the time of crisis.

Students read and engaged with assigned texts uploaded to Perusall each week, providing numerous opportunities for students to interact and collaborate with each other using the tool's various sharing and communication features. Both text interactions and peer-to-peer interactions on Perusall increased throughout the course, with peer-to-peer interactions increasing at a greater rate, indicative of community growth within the course. Collaborative annotation tools capture students' thinking and processing in the moment, more closely mirroring the learning that one might see in a face-to-face class when students discuss content with their instructor and/or classmates. This study offers insights for teachers, teacher educators, and school leaders about new approaches for developing community in online educational contexts, especially considering the drastic shift to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Results showed equivalency in students' learning across platforms, with the only exception being that students spent longer reviewing paper flashcards. Self-reported cognitive load and satisfaction were equal across platforms. Quantitative and qualitative data also suggested that, though students quickly label both laptops and smartphones as helpful for education, they see more educational value in laptops. This research suggests that smartphones present new ways of learning, but care must be taken with how smartphones are utilized in educational settings.",

    "description": "Technology, as a source of instruction, has fulfilled various purposes in foreign language learning environments. During the last decade, Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) has attracted teachers' and researchers' attention due to the look and feel of humanoid robots. However, in the field of pragmatics, studies highlighting the role of RALL have gone relatively unnoticed. To bridge this gap, this study sought to explore the effect of RALL on pragmatic features, including request and thanking speech acts by young Persian-speaking EFL learners. For this aim, 38 preschool children (3 to 6 year-old boys and girls) with no English learning experience were randomly assigned to the RALL (19 students) and non-RALL (19 students) groups. In the RALL group, a humanoid robot was used as an assistant to the teacher to play games, repeat the sentences, and interact with the students. In the non-RALL group the lessons included games similar to those in the RALL group, but without the presence of the robot. There were eight one-hour teaching sessions over a period of four weeks for both groups. Following completion of the lessons in both groups, the results of post-tests were analyzed using an independent sample t-test. The findings revealed a significant difference between the RALL and non-RALL groups' pragmatic performance for thanking and requesting. Based on these findings it can be concluded that RALL instruction was more effective than non-RALL instruction in improving the young learners' performance.",

    "description": "The growing popularity of online language learning means that both experienced language professionals and novices are developing and delivering all or part of their language classes online. This study set out to query practicing online language educators as to how they view themselves; that is, their professional vision of themselves and their craft. One hundred seventy-four online language educators responded to a survey, nine of whom also participated in a synchronous online interview. Responses to questions regarding professional vision varied by stance (teacher-, student-, content-, and medium-centric) with the majority of respondents reporting viewing themselves chiefly as student-centered in their work. Pervasive descriptors of professional vision--comprised of individual stances and qualities, along with how these are enacted in practice--paint a vibrant picture of professionalism in online language education. Respondents report valuing authentic and multimodal affordances, opportunities for tailored instruction/feedback, and highly productive interactions with students, interactions otherwise not feasible in live classrooms. Variations in professional vision are discussed along with implications for online language educator support and development.",

    "description": "In the past 10 to 15 years, researchers have begun to explore the possibility of synthesizing research on task-based language teaching (TBLT) and computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in the interests of advancing the development of both fields as well as informing practice. In particular, there has been an increasing number of naturalistic, classroom-based studies, which have demonstrated the affordances of TBLT in particular contexts, but whose findings may be less generalizable. Against this backdrop, a qualitative research synthesis of these classroom-based studies is warranted. The current study adopts grounded theory (GT) as the methodology to systematically synthesize qualitative findings from 16 technology-mediated TBLT studies published between 2002 and 2017 in second and foreign language contexts. This resulted in the identification of (a) the characteristics of technology-mediated TBLT, (b) the affordances and limitations of technology-mediated TBLT, and (c) the factors affecting the effectiveness of technology-mediated TBLT. Following this synthesis, a possible research agenda is proposed and practical implications are suggested.",

    "author": "Law, James, Barny, David, Poulin, Rachel",
    "description": "Although L2 reading is traditionally framed as an individual enterprise, digital annotation tools (DATs) have recently been developed allowing groups of readers to collaborate and provide mutual scaffolding through collective annotation of texts (Blyth, 2014; Thoms, Sung, &amp; Poole, 2017). These tools reframe L2 reading as an interactive process where meaning is socially constructed. Digital social reading supports a multiliteracies approach to teaching L2 pragmatics. This study investigates interactional patterns in social reading across multiple groups of learners. In total, 215 students enrolled in 11 sections of a beginning university French course used the DAT eComma to annotate six L2 songs over three months. We performed a mixed-methods analysis of the annotations. Social engagement, as measured by the frequency of questions and replies as well as word count, decreased over time, and the use of linguistic affordances increased in later songs. However, these patterns were highly variable across the sections. Language choice, social engagement and register, among other factors, were influenced by the shared practices of members of each section. Through their interactions, participants co-constructed meaning about the texts themselves as well as broader cultural and pragmatic questions. Instructors reported that engagement in class discussion corresponded to that of the online discussion.",

    "description": "If ever there was an appropriate time to reassess models of instructional delivery for language learning, that time is now. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a public health crisis, countless grieving families, and to a social order and private lives turned upside down. Many have lost their livelihoods, as businesses and governments struggle to cope with radically altered economies. The pandemic has not affected everyone uniformly, exposing sharp socioeconomic differences in access to health services/childcare and in working conditions/employment opportunities. Added to that are developments in the US, with repercussions worldwide, which have exposed in dramatic fashion the unequal social and political status of black and brown populations. These developments have resulted in upheavals in education. Teachers at all levels have suddenly found themselves thrust into teaching online. It looks increasingly likely that the widespread switch to distance learning is not a one-time occurrence but rather the new normal, especially in higher education. For second language educators, there are obvious issues at the micro level of implementation of remote instructional delivery that need to be considered. In this article the author outlines fruitful directions towards an instructional model that is primarily online, socially inclusive, and invites students to become engaged global citizens. This aligns with Levine's &quot;human ecological&quot; approach to language pedagogy in which he sees &quot;implementable change at the micro level as a means of ultimately affecting change at the meso and macro levels of context&quot; (Levine, 2020 p. 45). No model of language learning will be universal in its applicability, but the author believes there is an opportunity now to leverage new widespread experiences with online learning along with ongoing social concerns and activism to create the basis for a learning environment that holds the promise of being responsible and transformative at the individual and societal levels.",

The language learners, mediation via mobile devices, learning context, learning material and tasks, and learning outcomes need to be carefully examined in mobile-assisted reading. Hence, 28 empirical studies on mobile-assisted reading research published between 2008 and 2018 were selected and evaluated by the Activity Theory (AT) model. The investigators explored the research design of the studies and examined how reading development through mobile-assisted reading could be interpreted from seven constituents of AT -- tool, subject, object, rules, community, division of labor, and outcome. In addition, facilitating processes conducive to reading development were analyzed. Based on the desired outcomes achieved by the facilitating processes, design-, strategy-, and learner-related guidelines for reading development in MALL were proposed. The ultimate goal of MALL for fostering self-regulated learning is also discussed. The review provides instructors and researchers with detailed sociocultural accounts and recommendations for the design and implementation of reading in MALL.",

    "description": "The 3D virtual worlds (3DVWs) were widely used for language learning in the past two decades. Although numerous research studies acknowledged the affordance, a full-scale investigation that discussed how they can be applied to language learning with substantial evidence of effect sizes were not presented. Thus, this analysis aimed to synthesize the research findings particularly in the impact of 3DVWs on language learning by addressing two issues. The first one concerned the role of interaction in 3DVWs with theoretical bases, while the second issue concerned the effect sizes of moderating variables, based on experimental findings that were published between 2008 and 2019. Data with 50 variables generated from 13 primary studies were analyzed. Different patterns of interaction were identified based on three theories. The meta-analysis showed (1) significant overall linguistic gains (d = 0.832) and affective gains (d = 0.531), and (2) various effect sizes for moderator variables, such as types of learning activities. Based on these results, this paper used the notion of partnership to interpret the relation between 3DVWs and language learners.",

    "description": "We tested the effectiveness of the spaced-repetition flashcard application, Anki, on improving 62 university-level learners' second language (L2) learning in a semester-long beginning Spanish course. Using effective study strategies is critical for L2 learning, but college students learning an L2 often study with strategies that are only useful for short-term performance. Prior research has shown that spaced-repetition testing increases long-term memory retention so we hypothesized that regularly studying L2 vocabulary with Anki would improve L2 learning. Participants were students enrolled in a beginning Spanish course who were assigned to study with Anki as a class requirement. The results showed a positive relationship between days studying with Anki and Spanish performance at the end of the semester even while controlling for baseline abilities and for motivation, self-efficacy, and beliefs. However, students were reluctant to use the app and reported low enjoyment. Regardless, participants also reported having higher motivation and more effort-based or incremental beliefs about learning at the end of the semester. The present study answers calls for experimental research on specific strategy interventions that also produce genuine gains in second language acquisition.",

    "description": "The aim of the present study is two-fold. First, it uses eye-tracking to investigate the dynamics of item reading, both in multiple choice and matching items, before and during two hearings of listening passages in a computerized while-listening performance (WLP) test. Second, it investigates answer changing during the two hearings, which include four rounds of item reading taking place during: pre-listening in hearing 1, while-listening in hearing 1, pre-listening in hearing 2, and while-listening in hearing 2. The listening test was completed by 28 secondary school students in different sessions. Using time series, cross-correlation functions, and multivariate data analyses, we found that listeners tended to quickly skim the test items, distractors, and answers during pre-listening in hearing 1 and pre-listening in hearing 2. By contrast, during while-listening in hearing 1 and while-listening in hearing 2, significantly more attention was paid to the written stems, distractors, and options. The increment in attention to the written stems, distractors, and options was greater for the matching items and interactions between item format and item reading were also detected. Additionally, we observed a mixed answer changing pattern (i.e., incorrect-to-correct and correct-to-incorrect), although the dominant pattern for both item formats (67%) was wrong-to-correct. Implications of the findings for language research are discussed.",

    "author": "John, Paul, Wolf, Nina",
    "description": "Our study examines written corrective feedback generated by two online grammar checkers (GCs), Grammarly and Virtual Writing Tutor, and by the grammar checking function of Microsoft Word. We tested the technology on a wide range of grammatical error types from two sources: a set of authentic ESL compositions and a series of simple sentences we generated ourselves. The GCs were evaluated in terms of (1) coverage (number of errors flagged), (2) appropriacy of proposed replacement forms, and (3) rates of &quot;false alarms&quot; (forms mistakenly flagged as incorrect). Although Grammarly and Virtual Writing Tutor outperformed Microsoft Word, neither of the online GCs had high rates of overall coverage (&lt;50%). Consequently, they cannot be relied on to supply comprehensive feedback on student compositions. The finding of higher identification rates for errors from simple rather than authentic sentences reinforces this conclusion. Nonetheless, since few inaccurate replacement forms and false alarms were observed, only rarely is the feedback actively misleading. In addition, the GCs were better at handling some error types than others. Ultimately, we suggest that teachers use GCs with specially designed classroom activities that target selected error types before learners apply the technology to their own writing.",

    "description": "In response to calls for improving the quality of DCTs as data-gathering instruments, this study investigates the effectiveness of technology-enhanced discourse completion tasks (TE-DCTs) as a method for eliciting nonverbal speaker data. We used a mobile application to administer four TE-DCTs to native speakers (L1) and intermediate and advanced second-language (L2) speakers of Spanish. Each TE-DCT contained two scenarios with the goal of capturing nonverbal devices used in the speech act of attention-getting (i.e., devices used to draw the interlocutor's attention). The written description of each DCT scenario was supplemented with a short video clip to provide participants with nonverbal factors such as distance to interlocutor, bodily stance, and orientation of interlocutors. To capture nonverbal cues as part of the participant responses, the participant video recorded their oral responses to each scenario. The mobile application used was successful in capturing a variety of attention-getting elements, including nonverbal devices, in the majority of both L1 and L2 participant responses for all DCT scenarios. Drawing on this data, we argue for the use of mobile applications as an ecologically valid way to measure one type of pragmatic ability. In addition, we advocate their integration into L2 pedagogical practice.",

The technology acceptance model (TAM) was adopted to investigate users' perceptions of the app's usability and potential for second language (L2) learning. The model's two constructs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and one added factor, perceived enjoyment, formed the main predictors of users' intentions to continue using the app. Mean scores for the predictors were: perceived usefulness = 4.27/6, perceived ease of use = 3.88/6, and perceived enjoyment = 3.95/6, which are confirmed by the survey results that show that 10 of 13 participants intend to continue using the app. Qualitative results suggest that the app enhances users' ability to notice targeted forms in the musical input (e.g., liaison, gender) and, corroborating the quantitative data, suggest that users find the features in the app useful. Several comments also indicate that the ease of use could be improved (e.g., improved mobile device access).

Low-intermediate Dutch-speaking learners of French (N=86) took part in a four week intervention program. They were assigned to a subtitles group, a captions group, or a control group (who only took the tests). Vocabulary learning was measured by means of form and meaning recognition, as well as meaning recall tests. Results revealed that participants learned approximately 15% of the vocabulary they could have learned. Both treatment groups outperformed the control group in the meaning recognition test, but only the captions group outperformed the control group in the meaning recall test. Learning gains were mediated by cognateness with significantly higher odds to recall and recognize a cognate on the posttest than a noncognate. Frequency of occurrence and prior vocabulary knowledge had a positive effect on L2 learners' ability to recall and recognize the meaning of the target words. A positive relationship was also found between target words that were visually represented in the video and learners' meaning recall scores for those words.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an online distance-learning program in helping students develop oral English-language proficiency as they prepare to attend a university in the United States. The curriculum for the distance-learning program was built upon Moore's transactional distance theory, with an emphasis on interpersonal dialogue as a key tool in promoting oral proficiency. Students participated in synchronous and asynchronous interaction with fellow students, tutors, and their instructors. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) computer-assisted Oral Proficiency Interview (OPIc) provided the pretest and posttest measures for this study. To supplement this data, course surveys provided information concerning student opinions of course activities. OPIc results showed that students made significant gains in their oral proficiency from pretest to posttest. In surveys, students rated interaction with other tutors and teachers as instrumental in assisting them with their language learning, but rated interaction with their peers as less helpful.",

The data were 97 participant-generated task closings, which were analyzed in terms of linguistic repertoire and sequence organizations of terminal exchanges between participants in a dyad, and summons-answer sequences between participants and the researcher. The data showed that the participants recurrently implemented a sequence of soliciting and providing an agreement on the idea for task accomplishment to signal a forthcoming closing of task talk. The findings indicated that more proficient learners produced more extended sequences in conducting closing rituals. Some high-proficiency learners explicitly mentioned, or interacted with, the researcher, a third party, to initiate task closing or reformulate crossed messages in closing the talk.

An exploratory study of English learners in technology-enhanced classrooms was undertaken at an urban secondary school with a strong ongoing commitment to student-centered uses of technology. The study used quantitative classroom observations and student surveys to explain variation in English language development among English learners and across classrooms. Findings show that the features of technology-enhanced classrooms that best supported language development were aligned with student-centered and strengths-based teaching; the use of technology in the classroom alone was insufficient. Our findings also bring to light individual characteristics of English learners that shaped their language development in technology-enhanced classrooms. These individual characteristics include academic engagement and language use with friends, as well as student work and being over-age for their grade.",

    "description": "Usage-based linguistics posits that communicative functions, including pragmatics, are at the core of language (Tomasello, 1992). It is surprising, then, that pragmatics is rarely systematically included in second language curricula (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig, 2017), especially since pragmatics instruction has been shown to significantly contribute to pragmatic development (e.g., Taguchi &amp; Roever, 2017). Addressing this issue, the present study investigates learning outcomes and processes in self-access technology-enhanced instructional simulations for pragmatics that do not require classroom or teacher time. Importantly, these simulations include 1.) oral practice of extended discourse and 2.) feedback--two under-explored aspects of pragmatics instruction (e.g., Holden &amp; Sykes, 2013; Sydorenko, Daurio, &amp; Thorne, 2018). Two versions of the self-access simulations were examined: implicit-only instruction (15 participants) and implicit combined with explicit instruction (11 participants). The quantitative analysis of learners' production data and self-reported noticing revealed that both groups were similarly able to extract relevant (but varying) pragmatics features from instruction. The qualitative analysis, however, revealed that individual learner differences may be a critical factor in the effectiveness of implicit versus explicit instruction. The present study also illustrates how time spans and competition between cognitive resources affect pragmatics learning. In sum, this research informs further development of self-access pragmatics materials.",

As such, although L1 use is theoretically established as one of the many semiotic resources to be drawn upon for meaning-making as part of learners' integrated repertoire, its role as a catalyst for the establishment of social presence is under-theorised. This paper presents detailed micro-analyses of the videoconferencing interactions of three pairs of language learners, and offers a social semiotic account illustrating transformative processes of transformation, transduction and mimesis (Bezemer &amp; Kress, 2016). This study makes a unique contribution by demonstrating how translingual practice is mobilised with concomitant multimodal resources, and how this social-semiotic practice interweaves with all three dimensions of social presence (affective, interactive, and cohesive). It proposes that as a contributing factor to social presence, L1 use can assume a more prominent role in support for online language learning and teaching by helping learners project themselves socially and emotionally into their online interactions, and engage in a variety of transformative processes offering various learning potentials.",

In this study, we proposed a blended learning design to address students' problems with argumentation and language use in argumentative writing simultaneously. The design consisted of offline collaborative argumentation tasks and online collaborative writing tasks. Drawing on a focal group of seven students, we examined the online and offline experiences of the focal group by analyzing classroom discussions, different versions of online writing products, and interviews with the students. Our findings indicate that the offline collaborative argumentation tasks enabled students to have thorough discussions and make indepth arguments, and that the online collaborative writing tasks helped students deal with their language problems in writing and internalize the language for argumentative writing. Overall, students expressed positive attitudes toward the blended design. The findings provide implications for future research designing blended courses on argumentative writing and beyond.",

    "author": "Garc\u00eda-Pastor, Mar\u00eda Dolores",
    "description": "This study explores college EFL learners' construction of identity through the analysis of their pragmatic choices in digital stories, in which they narrated their relationship with another person they had helped in the past. More specifically, such choices were examined following Relational Dialectics Theory in learners' enactments of &quot;connection&quot; with and &quot;autonomy&quot; from this person. A specific view of identity in language education, the notion of &quot;relational work&quot; in (im)politeness research, and a social semiotic framework were also employed in data analysis. Learners' pragmatic choices ranged from the selection of the topic of their narratives according to types of social bonds, to the use of specific semiotic resources to build identities in conflict episodes of their stories (i.e., positive identities for themselves and positive and negative identities for their relational partners). The construction of these identities paralleled relational parties' convergent and divergent moves towards connection and autonomy, revealing their relational work. Learners used different semiotic resources in resolution episodes, which enabled them to craft positive identities for themselves as experts, teachers, and learners as well as position their relational partner as a competent agent and shape the connection-autonomy dialectic as &quot;superiority-equality&quot;.",

In a pretest, posttest study design, experiment group participants used the digital learning tool to engage in English language learning activities for 15-20 minutes daily for six months while a control group used a comparable digital tool to do online math activities for an equivalent amount of time. Results showed that experiment group learners demonstrated significantly greater English language gains than control group peers. Data from parent surveys support these results, shedding light on children's overall engagement in the activities, and providing information about their motivation and confidence levels in English. Findings show that the research-based digital language learning activities in ABCmouse ELL were effective at promoting learning in this population, supporting the idea that teachers and parents can use tools like this to help younger learners develop English language skills in English as a Foreign Language contexts like China.",

    "author": "Winans, Michael D.",
    "description": "This study investigates syntactic modifiers as part of the request speech act within email messages and builds on studies of L2 pragmatics within computer-mediated communication to identify how modifications affect perceived politeness. Enrolled in first-year composition courses, the participants formed two groups: English L1 (EL1) students (n=32) and English-language learning (ELX) students (n=25). Request head acts were analyzed using Biesenbach-Lucas's (2007) findings with respect to syntactic modifiers as formulated in the Cross-Cultural Study of Speech Act Realization Coding Framework (Blum-Kulka, House, &amp; Kasper, 1989). Previous research has shown that mitigation of the directness of a request affects the perception of politeness. The results of this study show that syntactic modifiers (e.g., past tense, progressive aspect, and syntactic embedding) were used to a greater extent by EL1 students, and that the modifiers correlated with politeness, as rated by instructors. However, the data also indicate that the limited use of syntactic modifiers did not have an effect on the politeness of ELX writers who were perceived as more polite than their EL1 counterparts. This study calls into question past research that does not take into account the learning environment nor the diverse language backgrounds of both students and instructors.",

    "description": "While the use of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) has exploded in recent years, little is known about their use to promote English as a foreign language (EFL) development. Thus, this study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the in-class use of the IPA, Alexa, among second language (L2) English students to support improvements in listening comprehension and speaking proficiency. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design with an experimental group (n = 13) which took part in a 10-week treatment of student-IPA interaction and a control group (n = 15) which did not. Results from the Mann-Whitney U test found that the experimental group was able to make more significant gains in L2 speaking proficiency. However, a significant difference was not found when comparing improvements in L2 listening comprehension. These findings suggest that IPAs may be a useful tool to promote L2 speaking skills and underscore the necessity for additional research on the emerging technology for language learning.",

However, there has been a paradigm shift in literacy education from traditional literacy to multimodal literacy. Little research has explored how students establish effective multimodal meaning-making using AR technology. This study is an investigation of how EFL college students use different multimodal modes to communicate with others using AR technology. Participants were 52 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. The collected data included (a) pre-and post-administrations of a multimodal literacy survey, (b) students' use of different modes to introduce tourist spots within the location-based AR app, and (c) students' reflection essays. The results demonstrated that the modes which students used were categorized into visual and auditory forms. The visual mode was composed of visual effects, images, and animations, whose functions were to focus viewers' attention on what is important, provide concrete ideas, process complex information, and promote engagement. The auditory mode consisted of background music and sound effects, which were used to arouse emotional feelings and enhance immersive experiences. The results also revealed that creating the content in a location-based AR app with the combination of different multimodal media significantly improved students' multimodal literacy.",

    "description": "Virtual reality (VR) is not only attracting the attention of the information and computer technology (ICT) industry (Shirer &amp; Torchia, 2017), especially in the production of consumer VR hardware, but also that of educators. One of the important features of VR is immersion, which enhances the situated experience of users. The sensation of being there no longer necessitates a physical presence (Flower, 2015). This aspect allows second language (L2) and foreign language (FL) learners to combine learning an additional language with an intercultural experience beyond geographical limitations with no need to step out of the classroom or leave their home countries (Wang, Petrina, &amp; Feng, 2017). Another important feature supported by VR applications is interaction, which provides users with a special channel of interpersonal communication (Ip et al., 2016). Given the importance of situated and contextual learning to FL learning, the specific features of VR of immersion and interaction are also of great interest to language educators. This article reviews previous studies of the application of VR for FL learning, introduces the present-day advanced developments in VR technology that have considerable potential for FL learning, and describes the research trends of VR in this area.",

The oral language development of advanced learners of English at a Spanish university was compared with a control group from the same class who did not participate in the VE. This study's motivation was two-fold: (1) pilot testing the VE project before making it mainstream and offering it as an integral part of this university's language courses, and (2) testing whether that increased advanced learners' purpose and motivation to communicate with others in the target language. Data were gathered from learners' oral grades and two questionnaires to report on the participants' experiences and examine the VEs' potential to support the development of oral skills. Quantitative analyses of learners' oral grades and questionnaires revealed that the VE contributed to boosting their oral skills, increased their motivation to learn the foreign language, and added a sense of purpose to collaborate with other learners while carrying out communicative tasks. Findings also suggest that improvement in oral skills was more noticeable among lower-proficiency learners taking part in the VE.",

    "description": "The concept of successful participation is context-dependent. Learners have different definitions, which are subject to potential tension in the manner of participation that affects other aspects of the interaction. Drawing on activity theory (Vygotsky, 1987), the present study analyzes tensions that emerged during a six-week telecollaborative project between American learners of Japanese (AMU students) and Japanese learners of English (JPU students) through their understandings of successful participation. Transpacific dyads engaged in online discussions regarding assigned topics and a series of reflective tasks. Using a three-stage grounded theory data coding strategy, major contradictions are identified and analyzed. The findings suggest emergent contradictions in two dyads deriving from differences in the definition of participation. In one dyad, the JPU participant negotiated the imbalanced division of labor due to her passiveness by intentionally changing her participatory behavior. In the other dyad, the AMU participant displayed frustration and disappointment by his JPU partner whose definition of successful participation comprised prompt responses instead of proactive engagement in the discussion. These two cases illustrate how learners' understandings of successful participation informed their actions and how local definitions affected their overall evaluation of the interaction.",

The results of the analysis suggest that learners reacted differently when discussing their own culture and that of their foreign language. The data collected provides evidence that learners avoided using monoglossic (i.e. bare) statements regarding both their L1 and L2 cultures, and fewer contracting statements for the latter. Overall, learners also presented a preference for positive Affective, Judgment, and Appreciation markers, which suggests their interest in creating an environment of solidarity and closeness with their telecollaborative partners. The results also indicated the value of discussing the topic in general, without particular reference to the first or the second culture, as a safe space to address conflicting issues that might result in communication breakdowns and move beyond personal, superficial, and anecdotal references.",

    "description": "It is widely accepted that effective blended learning initiates students into constructivist learning experiences by integrating face-to-face approaches with online technology. The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework combines teaching, social, and cognitive presences to explore students' blended learning experiences from the perspectives of collaboration, critical thinking, and knowledge construction (Garrison &amp; Vaughan, 2008). The present study draws upon the CoI framework to explore students' learning experiences in an ESP blended course, English for Agriculture and Forestry, with the aim of assessing the interrelationship among the teaching, social, and cognitive presences of CoI and the impact of the blended learning mode on students' learning processes. Data was collected using the Community of Inquiry Survey Instrument (Arbaugh et al., 2008) and students' evaluations. The data was quantitatively analysed by multiple linear regression (MLR) and descriptive statistics, and qualitatively by thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). The results of the study indicate that the teaching, social, and cognitive presences are correlated, and that social and cognitive presences have a high correlation. Furthermore, students' motivation towards learning specialised English was activated in the blended learning process. The study has wider implications for exploring a constructivist blended learning mode for ESP and General English courses.",

Each video was presented twice with one of the five caption types: (1) no caption (NC), (2) full caption with no audio (FCNA), (3) full caption (FC), (4) full caption with highlighted target-word (FCHTW), and (5) full caption with highlighted target-word and L1 gloss (FCL1), where gloss was presented simultaneously with full caption. The results showed that caption type did affect vocabulary learning. FCL1 facilitated the learning of both word form and meaning in a multimedia listening activity. FCHTW increased attention to word form at the expense of word meaning. Videos with either captions (FCNA) or audio (NC) were not helpful for the learning of written words, indicating that presentation of verbal information through two modalities (audio plus text) was superior over single-modality presentation. While caption type had no impact on listening comprehension, concurrent presentations of video, audio, and captions did not overload the learners in the FC condition, suggesting that selective attention might be allocated to different parts of the visual stimuli during the first and second exposure to the videos. Additionally, the presence of highlighted words and glosses in the captioning line might direct learner attention to vocabulary rather than video content.",

    "description": "A number of prominent educators have confirmed that developing learners' metacognitive strategies about listening is an important way of helping them learn how to listen to improve their listening. With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, many listening training systems provide various types of help options in support of listening comprehension. However, learners may be unaware of how effectively use these help options or they may rely too heavily on them, thus reducing the effectiveness of their listening practice. Therefore, this study develops a digital pen-based learning system with a reward mechanism that guides learners through the metacognitive processes effectively use available help options to develop listening skills. Two experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of the proposed system on learners' listening achievement, motivation, and metacognitive awareness. The experimental results indicated that the proposed system improved learners' listening comprehension, learning motivation, and metacognitive awareness. A lag-sequential analysis was conducted to infer learners' behavioral patterns to explore how learners used the help options to perform listening tasks. Several interesting behavioral patterns were found and discussed.",

By using patterns that emerged from the data, the researcher contextualized the use of the L2 and learner engagement principles (Little, 1991) into the three main categories of Grammar, Interaction, and Weeklyto code transcribed Zoom sessions via NVivo. Coding results, as well as significant average differences between pre- and post-surveys, revealed that Zoom was an effective tool that can be used by participants for SCMC course-related activities to develop learner autonomy and create an authentic language experience. Results also showed that interaction and engagement were dependent on language level and SCMC among peers from the same university was a valuable tool for L2 learning and teaching.",

Social media engagement metrics (upvotes and responses) were used to measure and observe the quantity and quality of online interaction, and post-task questionnaires and follow-up interviews investigated learner perceptions about the language and cyberpragmatics in the online communities they encountered. Quantitative results show that participants struggled to achieve high levels of interaction with other users, but qualitative results indicate a wide range of potential benefits for ILP exploration and development. The findings and implications of this study contribute towards best practices in developing strategies for ILP in online spaces and cyberpragmatic awareness among language learners, enabling them to reach higher levels of participation in online communities.",

    "author": "Garcia, Christina, Nickolai, Dan, Jones, Lillian",
    "description": "This paper presents a 15-week classroom study measuring the student outcomes of instructor-led pronunciation lessons versus entirely ASR-based pronunciation training. Seventy-six second-semester Spanish language learners were divided into two groups, one experimental (n=44) and one control (n=32). Over the course of six modules, both groups completed a pre- and post-study recording, as well as explicit pronunciation training sessions. These sessions included pre- and post-recordings, with either traditional or ASR pronunciation practice in between, which aimed attention at targeted phonemes. All student recordings were evaluated by native and near-natives for comprehensibility, nativeness, fluency, and perceived confidence. The results show that the effect of explicit and ASR instruction varies depending on the module and characteristic evaluated. ASR seems to outperform traditional instruction when targeting specific phonemes, especially in the short-term, while the explicit instruction group saw longer-term gains in regards to comprehensibility. Holistically, the data suggest that ASR-based instruction shows promise to improve certain aspects of pronunciation, but that using both techniques in tandem would be the most strategic approach to handling the development of this fundamental aspect of learner speech. The data presented here highlight the role and effectiveness of computer-assisted pronunciation training for lower-level Spanish courses.",

In the game, the player took the role of a robot who works in a restaurant in China and runs quests by interacting with built-in characters. The game incorporated four key gaming attributes: &quot;context (representation)&quot;, &quot;goals&quot;, &quot;feedback&quot;, and &quot;interactivity&quot;. This paper reports the usability of these gaming attributes based on interview data collected from 12 learners of Chinese who completed the game. Results showed that the combination of &quot;context&quot; and &quot;interactivity&quot; in &quot;Questaurant&quot; delivered an engaging learning experience, while explicit &quot;feedback&quot; directly contributed to learning. Participants raised some concerns regarding the motivational appeal of &quot;goals&quot; and implicit &quot;feedback&quot; in the game. This paper further discusses implications for developing and utilizing digital games for pragmatics learning.",

    "description": "This article offers insights into the ownership and use of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) among Indonesian middle and high school students. The study is based on primary data collected from a survey of 1,157 students at two middle schools and two high schools from two different regions in Indonesia. Data analysis includes multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression models. The findings show that both ownership and use of mobile devices varies significantly among students of different sex, age, location, and most importantly socioeconomic status. This article also reports the use of mobile apps in three separate categories (i.e., educational apps, social media, and mobile games), showing some differences in duration and frequency of mobile apps use between different group of students. These findings can serve as a foundation for further research on how mobile technology can be used to improve educational attainment in Indonesia and other developing countries.",

    "description": "Rural school districts are unique educational settings requiring efficient use of resources. Barriers to high-quality educational practices in rural settings include the distance from professional development expertise and limited funding. To address these potential obstacles for implementing School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, we utilized telecoaching for providing monthly technical assistance. Results of this case study indicate that telecoaching in a rural school district across 1 academic year may be an effective alternative for in-person coaching. Descriptive statistics including implementation fidelity, discipline and attendance outcomes, and telecoaching treatment integrity are presented. Implications for practice and future directions are discussed.",

    "description": "This study investigates the possibility and efficacy of paper-based, in-class, data-driven learning (DDL) of academic lexical bundles below the C1 level of proficiency described by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR; advanced high ACTFL). A two-stage experimental design involving three groups (n = 41) and 24 two-to-four word academic items was implemented. First, the question of whether this type of learning works with these items below the C1 level is addressed through a nonequivalent-groups quasi-experimental design covering a five-week period. The results indicate that this technique is effective at the B2 level, but not at the A2-B1 level. Next, an equivalent-groups experimental design compares this style of learning to conventional techniques at the B2 level. The results of this stage suggest that paper-based, in-class DDL is more effective than conventional learning with academic lexical bundles at the B2 level.",

    "description": "This study explores the potential of the English File Pronunciation (EFP) app to help foreign language learners improve their pronunciation. Participants were 52 Spanish EFL learners enrolled in an English Studies degree. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess the participants' perception and production (imitative, controlled, and spontaneous) before and after training. The targets addressed were a range of segmental features that tend to be fossilised in the interlanguage of advanced Spanish EFL learners, namely English /[ash] [open back unrounded vowel]? [open-mid back unrounded vowel] [schwa]/ and the /s - z/ contrast. Training took place over a period of two weeks in which participants used the English File pronunciation app for around 20 minutes a day. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (control and experimental). However, after the post-test, the group that had acted as control started to receive instruction and, after two weeks, took a second post-test, therefore acting as experimental too. Training fostered substantial improvements in the learners' perception and production of the target features, although the differences between groups were not statistically significant for every sound or in every task.",

    "description": "The goal of this study was to explore how distance language learners' pronunciation skills develop with and without targeted pronunciation training during their first semester of university language instruction. To this end, a new computer-assisted method of pronunciation instruction was designed, and its effectiveness, as well as learners' experiences with the method, were assessed. The study was conducted over the course of one semester with 67 distance learners of German. Perception and oral production skills on the word and sentence level were assessed at the beginning and end of the semester for a treatment group that received targeted pronunciation instruction and a control group that did not receive pronunciation instruction, but otherwise followed the same curriculum. The results of the study showed that distance learners' pronunciation skills did not improve significantly over the course of the semester in the absence of targeted pronunciation training. Results further indicated that learners who received targeted pronunciation training improved significantly from pre- to posttest and significantly outperformed learners in the control group on measures of perception and production accuracy at the end of the semester. These findings suggest that distance language instruction can benefit from including targeted pronunciation training.",

    "description": "As digital technologies have become ubiquitous thanks to the Internet, new modes of feedback in L2 writing have emerged, yet what remains unclear is how feedback given through alternative modes helps improve writing quality and how new feedback tools fit in the overall context of writing instruction. Therefore, the purpose of this embedded mixed-methods study is to assess how three online feedback modes help improve student writing. Thirty-three intermediate Turkish-L1 learners of English received written, audio and screencast feedback in Google Drive to improve their writing in a multi-draft essay-writing task and an essay-revision task with three parallel essays. The results indicated that it was the audio group that made the highest number of correct revisions in the essay-writing task, while there was not a significant difference among the three feedback modes in the essay-revision task. Semi-structured interviews and screen recordings provided qualitative data about their preferences and how they worked with each mode to address both microlevel and macrolevel problems. The participants did not uniformly prefer a particular feedback mode but highlighted the potential benefits and downsides of each mode.",

    "description": "With the fast-paced development of technology in today's society, there has been emerging a shift from paper-based reading to digital online reading. While the benefits of exposure to print have been well-established in previous studies, how online reading may impact individuals' literacy development is largely underexplored. The current study investigated if the amount of English reading experience on the Internet could predict EFL students' lexical knowledge and reading comprehension ability. Participants were ninety-seven Vietnamese undergraduate students who were administered a website checklist and a vocabulary size test. Their reading comprehension scores were also collected as measures of their reading abilities. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modelling were utilized for data analysis. The results indicated that exposure to L2 online text was a significant predictor of the participants' vocabulary size as well as their reading comprehension growth during a course of two years. Pedagogical implications are discussed.",

    "description": "This experimental study examined the design and effectiveness of embodied interactions for learning. The researchers designed a digital learning environment integrating body joint mapping sensors to teach novice learners Chinese characters, and examined whether the embodied interaction would lead to greater knowledge acquisition in language learning compared to the conventional mouse-based interaction. Fifty-three adult learners were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The study adopted a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest on knowledge acquisition. Although higher scores were found for the embodied interaction group in both posttests, only the delayed posttest showed a statistically significant group difference. The findings suggested that active embodied actions lead to better knowledge retention compared with the passive visual embodiment. The body-moving process works as an alternative and complementary encoding strategy for character understanding and memorization by associating the semantic meaning of a character with the construction of a body posture.",

    "description": "This study evaluated the voice of a modern English text-to-speech (TTS) system in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context in terms of its speech quality, ability to be understood by L2 users, and potential for focus on specific language forms. Twenty-nine Brazilian EFL learners listened to stories and sentences, produced by a TTS voice and a human voice, and rated them on a 6-point Likert scale according to holistic criteria for evaluating pronunciation: Comprehensibility, naturalness, and accuracy. In addition, they were asked to answer a set of comprehension questions (to assess understanding), to complete a dictation/transcription task to measure intelligibility, and to identify whether the target past -ed form was present or not in decontextualized sentences. Results indicate that the performance of both the TTS and human voices were perceived similarly in terms of comprehensibility, while ratings for naturalness were unfavorable for the synthesized voice. For text comprehension, dictation, and aural identification tasks, participants performed relatively similarly in response to both voices. These findings suggest that TTS systems have the potential to be used as pedagogical tools for L2 learning, particularly in EFL settings, where natural occurrence of the target language is limited or non-existent.",

    "author": "Sato, Takeshi, Murase, Fumiko, Burden, Tyler",
    "description": "This study aims to examine the efficacy of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) of English as a foreign or second language (L2) through two perspectives: learning gain and learner autonomy. Previous studies have shown that L2 learning combined with media could activate the learning processes, resulting in an easier recall of the target vocabulary required in L2. In addition, mobileassisted L2 learning could also enhance autonomous learning inasmuch as successful MALL would have to rely mainly on the autonomous learner even in learning contexts where the goal and task are already fixed. Based on this standpoint, the study hypothesizes that the engagement in L2 learning with mobile devices along with a classroom-based writing course could make L2 learners not only achieve the target L2 lexis effectively, leading to better L2 writing performance, but also help them to be more autonomous even in a setting when the task and goal are fixed. To test this hypothesis, both empirical and questionnaire studies were conducted for Japanese undergraduates (n=94). Based on the results of three weeks of L2 academic writing practice between groups learning with and without mobile devices, the findings of our t-test analyses of learners' vocabulary recall and a questionnaire survey about learner autonomy suggested that MALL significantly contributed not only to L2 vocabulary recall in comprehensive and productive tests, but also to enhancing positive attitudes towards autonomous learning.",
