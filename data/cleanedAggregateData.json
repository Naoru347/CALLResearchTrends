Twelve Taiwanese French as a foreign language (FFL) students, divided into three groups, were required to conduct a variety of tasks in one of the three learning environments (video/audio, audio, and face-to-face (f2f)) over 18 weeks. The participants' performance in three oral tests was compared to see if they had developed oral skills in the three environments. The other data such as their online chat records, interview transcriptions, learning journals, and the instructor's observation journal provided further information about how they developed oral skills in their learning environment. The results suggested that factors (related to task design, learners' strategy use) generated by the three environments, rather than the environments themselves, have the biggest impact on learners' oral proficiency development. In addition, all three environments held the potential to help different types of students to develop oral skills.

A sample of 108 students was recruited--54 students were assigned to the experimental group with blended learning and another 54 students to the control group with on-site instruction only. Results of this study revealed that the blended learning was effective in enhancing students' reading proficiency in the experimental group as shown in the semistructured interview for students' conceptions of blended learning, log files for their approaches to blended learning, and the post-test for the improvement of their reading outcomes. From the new conceptions and approaches generated by students, three factors were identified as helping them take control of their own reading in blended learning. First, the online reading activities enabled students to extensively practice what they had learned in the on-site instruction without the limitations of time and location. Second, the process data (log files) for students to observe and reflect on their own online reading process in strategy usages engaged students in metacognition since they were not allowed to compare their reading processes with those of their peers in the on-site instruction.

In addition to low frequency words, intermediate students frequently looked up high and middle frequency words, whereas advanced participants did not have much difficulty with either high or middle frequency words. The e-dictionary helped intermediate participants consolidate word meaning, learn new words and close the vocabulary knowledge gap between them and advanced learners; in contrast, the e-dictionary afforded less reading development for the advanced group. As for reading comprehension, the e-dictionary enhanced reading comprehension of intermediate participants to a level comparable to advanced students. The low comprehension of advanced participants might partly have been caused by their unfamiliarity with the inductive discourse structure of the text.

This research attempts to show how a CALL system can be constructed following the unique properties of the Chinese language so it can benefit the learner maximally. First, we analyze student journals to identify problematic areas for British students learning Chinese as a foreign language, which seem to spread across levels of phonology, morphology, orthography, and vocabulary in an inextricable fashion. To address this issue, we designed a hierarchical network model linking levels of sound, syllables, characters, words, and phrases together in the form of nodes and connections. Current implementation of the model is a CALL system nicknamed Linkit, which can work alongside a textbook or a corpus, offering interconnected elements of the Chinese language such as the syllable, the character, the word, and the phrase on the same screen. The purpose of the design is for students to view a Chinese character not just as a character, but to see how it relates to other homophonic characters by appreciating the underlying phonological similarities and how the character can develop into a word or a phrase. We suggest that the emphasis on this type of continuity is a key factor in designing Chinese-specific CALL programs.

This article discusses both these aspects, with one experiment on estimating the important articulatory features from a speaker through acoustic-to-articulatory inversion and one user test with a virtual pronunciation teacher, in which the articulatory changes made by seven learners who receive audiovisual feedback are monitored using ultrasound imaging.

Our results showed that both student populations had not used ICT much for language learning previously, that their ratings varied depending on use of ICT in their course and that students with an increased use of technology in their courses seemed to realize its true potential for productive skills, but also some of its disadvantages. The perceived usefulness of ICT for skills and different areas of language was also different. The students who had used ICT less in their course rated it as most useful for some areas of language (grammar and vocabulary) followed by receptive skills, and least useful for the development of pronunciation and productive skills. However, students who had used ICT more in their course rated it lower for its usefulness for areas of language and receptive skills, and rated it higher for the improvement of pronunciation and productive skills. This study encourages the use of ICT for language learning, showing that students had very positive perceptions of its usefulness, and recommends adding guides and training to blended learning experiences to diminish the number of students rejecting the use of ICT.", "subject": "Educational Technology, Teaching Methods, Blended Learning, Technology Uses in Education, Student Attitudes, Second Language Instruction, Technology Integration, English (Second Language), Foreign Countries, Skill Development, Spanish, Foreign Students, College Students, Student Surveys, Language Skills", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "Spain"}, {"id": "EJ1042721", "title": "Environmental Factors Affecting Computer Assisted Language Learning Success: A Complex Dynamic Systems Conceptual Model", "author": "Marek, Michael W., Wu, Wen-Chi Vivian", "description": "This conceptual, interdisciplinary inquiry explores Complex Dynamic Systems as the concept relates to the internal and external environmental factors affecting computer assisted language learning (CALL).

However, are these curricular decisions supported by research? Overall, a cursory review of empirical studies appears to provide strong support for the use of CALL. Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality.

Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use.

Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction. While some may argue that the ICW cannot take the place of face-to-face interactions in a well-designed and executed ESL course, the e-learning environment offers several advantages: it is self-paced, private (thus less threatening), and provides continuous opportunities for practice and reinforcement.", "subject": "Online Courses, Web Based Instruction, Foreign Nationals, Nurses, Communicative Competence (Languages), Intercultural Communication, Workshops, Phonemes, Vowels, Intonation, Electronic Learning, Improvement Programs, Independent Study", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1032527", "title": "Direct and Indirect Access to Corpora: An Exploratory Case Study Comparing Students' Error Correction and Learning Strategy Use in L2 Writing", "author": "Yoon, Hyunsook, Jo, Jung Won", "description": "Studies on students' use of corpora in L2 writing have demonstrated the benefits of corpora not only as a linguistic resource to improve their writing abilities but also as a cognitive tool to develop their learning skills and strategies.

This study inspected the status quo of technology integration in Iranian EFL classes and investigated the obstacles, as perceived by the Iranian EFL teachers, toward implementing CALL in Iran. First, 100 EFL teachers completed the Teacher Technology Integration Survey developed by Vannatta and Banister (2009), to help estimate technology use in EFL classes. Then the researchers interviewed twelve teachers, comprising two EFL teacher educators with no CALL experience, four teachers with the experience of integrating technology in their EFL classes, four EFL teachers who had recently finished an online CALL teacher education program, and two EFL teachers with no CALL experience. The semi-structured interview questions were designed by the researchers, one of whom has extensive experience with CALL, and were revised based on the suggestions of a colleague with expertise in teacher education. One of the researchers conducted the interviews, each of which lasted for 30-50 minutes. The researchers used structural content analysis of the interview transcripts to find themes relevant to the research question. The results suggest that on the whole, Iranian EFL teachers do not usually integrate digital technology into their classes; and the obstacles in implementing CALL in language classrooms could be classified into three categories: teacher, facility, and learner constraints.

By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy.

Student attitudes were investigated via a questionnaire and then triangulated through interviews and student logs.

Beginning CFL learners at a Midwestern university answered questions about their reading strategies after reading passages in Chinese with and without a pop-up dictionary, did think-aloud protocols, and wrote recalls. Qualitative analyses of answers and think-aloud protocols identified generally-used strategies both with and without the pop-up dictionary: engaging in bottom-up strategies, monitoring comprehension, using the first language, and focusing on lexical cues. Qualitative analyses also revealed different reading strategies in obtaining character and word meanings and in constructing sentence meanings. Statistical results indicated that much of the improvement gained from using the pop-up dictionary during the first reading was not retained over a short period of time. It may be concluded that the use of the pop-up dictionary may not alter CFL learners' general reading strategies, yet the dictionary does provide additional resources to facilitate meaning construction.

L2 writing research has long highlighted the benefits of collaboration in terms of both L2 learning and text quality. Most recently, the positive effect of co-ownership and peer feedback on process and product has been emphasized in studies on Computer-Supported Collaborative Writing.

The present paper bridges this gap through an empirical study combining Web 2.0 technologies with an academic writing task. Collaborative and individual writing processes and products are compared by applying a mixed-methods approach. The results shed new light on claims made in previous studies that collaboration leads to higher text accuracy. No statistically relevant difference was found between the individual and collaborative syntheses in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency.

Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary.

When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning.

Informed by Literacy Studies, the paper reports the findings from a larger qualitative study and explores the relationship between technology use in personal and professional domains of three language teachers. The study found that the participants' digital mindsets, comprising assumptions about affordances of digital technologies, shaped the ways in which the participants used digital technologies within and beyond classrooms. New literacies required creative and elaborated assumptions about affordances; however, these understandings had different significance for the participants. The article explains why teaching new literacies continues to be challenging and suggests implications for teachers' professional learning and education and language pedagogy.", "subject": "Media Literacy, Technology Uses in Education, Beliefs, Language Teachers, Teaching Styles, Educational Practices, Individual Characteristics, Teacher Characteristics, Case Studies, Elementary Secondary Education, Interviews, Mass Media Use, Use Studies, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Photography", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": "Australia"}, {"id": "EJ1075831", "title": "The Intersection of Multimodality and Critical Perspective: Multimodality as Subversion", "author": "Huang, Shin-ying", "description": "This study explores the relevance of multimodality to critical media literacy.

By analysing two English-language learners' multimodal ensembles, the study reports on how multimodality contributes to a critical perspective when engaging with media texts, and on the ways in which learners orchestrate multiple semiotic resources to demonstrate their analysis of the politics of representation and the resulting consequences. The findings reveal that, on the one hand, the students were able to identify the power relations between characters as well as how particular characters are marginalized in the media texts they viewed by paying attention to the multiple modes that make up the text's representation. On the other hand, the students were able to articulate the ideological subtexts they identified through the orchestration of various modes rather than relying on the linguistic mode, making their message as persuasive and effective as those in the media texts viewed.", "subject": "Media Literacy, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Power Structure, Semiotics, Films, Teaching Methods, Racial Relations, Gender Differences, Interpersonal Relationship, College Students, Second Language Instruction, Critical Literacy, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Focus Groups, Interviews", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1075832", "title": "Wikipedia Writing as Praxis: Computer-Mediated Socialization of Second-Language Writers", "author": "King, Brian W.", "description": "This study explores the writing of Wikipedia articles as a form of authentic writing for learners of English in Hong Kong.

Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching.

Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter.

Students tend to favour clear-cut, instructivist rather than constructivist feedback, and guided self-evaluation through model solutions in online learning environments. However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress.

A literature search located 25 relevant studies for the final analysis. Each study was independently coded for learner, design and publication characteristics. The averaged effect size was estimated from the included studies. The results of the meta-analysis reveal that communication mediated by computer/technologies produced a moderate positive effect on L2 learners' oral proficiency compared to face-to-face (F2F) communication or no interaction. Furthermore, CMC has roughly similar effect on pronunciation, lexical and syntactic level of oral production; however, it might have a negative impact on fluency and accuracy. This meta-analysis also found that the effect of CMC on oral proficiency depends on several methodological factors such as task type, outcome measurement, treatment length, and assessment task. Major findings of the current meta-analysis include: (1) studies relying on elicited data are superior to those utilizing naturalistic data; (2) reading aloud seems to be the task that could elicit the best oral performance from students; (3) surprisingly, CMC appeared to be harmful for accuracy and fluency; (4) studies that employed decision-making generated the largest effect size, followed by studies that used more than one task type; (5) among the four tasks, jigsaw actually generated a negative effect on oral performance; and (6) as the most popular task employed by primary researchers, opinion-exchange studies produced the smallest effect size.

Efforts to develop spell checkers specifically for L2 learners have focused on training software to offer more appropriate suggestion lists for replacing misspellings, but research suggests that students often select the wrong word from such lists. Moreover, since their spelling errors are often competence errors arising from misconceptions about the target language, students might benefit from feedback that addresses the underlying problem rather than simply suggesting the correct word. This article describes the use of a corpus of learner English to identify common misspellings produced by Spanish learners of English. For each of these errors, hand-crafted feedback has been written explaining how the correct spelling is consistent with the orthography or morphology of English. This material has been incorporated into a prototype spell checker for learners of English. Meanwhile, the software simply flags other errors as &quot;not amongst the 90,000 commonest words of English&quot;.

This paper examines an attempt of The Writing Portal (TWP), a supplementary online writing platform, to support students' writing needs throughout the five stages of the writing process, viz., planning, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing. Social constructivist principles underpin TWP, which was designed to engender collaboration amongst its student participants. Not only does TWP provide links to evaluated Internet resources and a writing portfolio, but it also features collaboration tools such as the Group Forum, chat, a writing portfolio, a private messaging system, and a comment function for pages or articles created. Thus, it is very much akin to a &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for academic writing within a flexible and supportive environment. In this qualitative case study, 16 third-year TESL pre-service teachers at a Malaysian Teacher Education Institute embarked on a 12-week writing course using TWP. Qualitative data in the form of students' online discourses, task reflections, log files, and digital artefacts were captured to explore how TWP's affordances supported students' writing needs. In addition, Soller's collaborative learning conversation skills (CLCS) taxonomy was used as an analytical framework to investigate the collaborative learning engendered in the online environment. The findings indicate that TWP served its purpose by addressing students' writing needs at all stages of the writing process as they accomplished multiple writing tasks. Additionally, evidence of collaborative learning is evident in three functions of TWP: the Group Forum, chat, and the comments for pages/articles.

The study found mismatches between students' and teachers' perceptions of the degree of teacher involvement and the specific roles teachers could play. On the one hand, students expected teachers to play a greater role in supporting their autonomous learning with technology by recommending a variety of technological resources and sharing metacognitive and cognitive strategies for effective use of the resources. On the other hand, teachers expected to play a minimal role due to their overestimation of students' capacities and their concern over their limited abilities to provide such support.

Using mixed methods approach, survey items were generated first using qualitative methods (e.g. expert interviews and document analysis). The content validity of the items was established through expert and preservice teacher reviews. The survey was then validated through two rounds of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the first with 174 preservice EFL teachers and the second with 204 preservice EFL teachers. The results of the first round indicated a five-factor structure: technological knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and a fifth factor that combined TCK, TPK, and TPACK items.

No significant difference was observed between the ACA and ATA groups in terms of vocabulary posttests. However, the ACA group slightly outscored the ATA group in the long-term L2 form recall tests (i.e., delayed tests).

This study identifies variables within concordancing that may provide learners with diverging affordances, affordances that are not mutually compatible, and explores concordancing through a survey of concordance users' preferences. The data is analysed through a series of factor analyses which indicate that concordancing is a complex, multidimensional construct. It finds that there are at least four factors underlying the construct of concordancing: how citations are formatted, the type of corpus used, the order citations are presented in, and the task engaged in. Each of these factors represents a dimension of variance amongst concordance users. If it is safe to assume that concordance users' preferences are unlikely to be arbitrary, and are likely to indicate the affordances of concordancing in a particular configuration, then each factor represents a potentially significant variable in learner use of concordances.

This paper analyzes findings from 10 learner-based studies that draw on accounts of SLA informed by cognitive and sociocultural theories. Analysis reveals that research conducted from the sociocultural perspective provides evidence of constructs identified as playing a central role in SLA. Analysis indicates that playing MMORPGs elicits target language dialogue involving collaboration, assistance and co-construction. Data show that MMORPGs provide access to conditions conducive to the operation of zones of proximal development. Findings show that this type of game provides access to both in-game and extramural communities of practice that facilitate language socialization. Research undertaken from a cognitive perspective shows that participation in MMORPG-based gaming facilitates production of the target language. However, this work does not provide conclusive evidence that game play elicits forms of interaction such as negotiation, that are hypothesized as playing a central role in learning in the cognitive account of SLA.

We draw on the conceptual frameworks and discourse analytical tools developed by researchers of online communication practices at the post-secondary level and turn this lens to examine how an international online exchange project might contribute to the creation of an in-school learning environment in which adolescents use technology to interact with distally located peers through telecollaboration. The particular contribution of this study is twofold: to offer insight into patterns that characterize the literacy practices that emerge through the introduction of telecollaboration into the learning environment and to document the types of pedagogical decision-making that such projects introduce into the secondary context. Using a case-study design, we explored two central areas: (1) What patterns of interaction emerge in the literacy practices of adolescent students as they build relationships with their intercultural partners? (2) How do teachers address the pedagogical issues that are foregrounded when introducing innovative literacy practices such as telecollaboration into the secondary learning environment? Our premise is that online exchanges might offer a different kind of learning experience that provides opportunities for adolescents to engage with language in ways that do not typically get enacted in conventional language classrooms. Our interest therefore is grounded both in providing a rich, descriptive inventory of how adolescents engage with telecollaboration in the classroom context, as well as in documenting the types of pedagogical issues that are introduced. We offer a linguistically grounded portrait of what constitutes the interactional patterns and pedagogical issues in a classroom learning environment shaped by the introduction of an online intercultural project. Using a case-study approach, therefore, we provide close documentation and analyses of a 15-week, classroom-based telecollaboration project through student transcripts and focal teacher interviews.

Furthermore, we explored the relationships between research variables of this study, such as speaking performance on individual and interactive storytelling, the number of animation representations, and the system actual usage, with learning achievement. Four main findings were found in this study. First, students who used the system for creating stories significantly outperformed students who did not use it on the post-test. This finding suggests that storytelling activity with support of the system was beneficial for improving speaking skills. Second, speaking performance and the number of animation representations significantly correlated with learning achievement. Students who performed well during learning activities usually studied diligently and scored higher on final test. Animations could help students remember vocabulary and practice speaking to describe their animated stories. Third, only the speaking performance on individual storytelling was found as the significant predictor of learning achievement. Students working individually on storytelling were independent; they were less distracted from others, and had more opportunity for practice. The last but not the least, most students expressed positive perceptions and attitude toward the system and learning activities.

However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms.

Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books.

To help CFL students and teachers efficiently search for proper collocates, this paper introduces a new web-based collocation retrieval tool, ICE (Intelligent Collocation Engine), which is based on a large part-of-speech-tagged Chinese news corpus. To determine if the new tool can facilitate the searching of collocations, this tool was tested by a group of CFL students to find proper collocates in a translation task. The results showed that the students who used the ICE tool could successfully found many proper Chinese collocates for a given noun. In addition, 12 in-service CFL teachers were also invited to evaluate the effectiveness of this collocation tool. These teachers indicated that they could find proper Chinese collocates easily with the help of ICE. The teachers also commented that they might use the collocation retrieval tool to prepare their teaching materials. Both findings of the experiment as well as the survey suggest that the new collocation retrieval tool can facilitate Chinese collocation teaching and learning, but the content and functions of this tool can be further enhanced. The findings of this study can be useful for language teachers, researchers, and developers of corpus-based learning tools.", "subject": "Chinese, Phrase Structure, Second Language Learning, Computational Linguistics, Translation, Task Analysis, Second Language Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness, Instructional Materials, Language Teachers, Researchers, Student Attitudes, Likert Scales, Student Surveys, Feedback (Response), Statistical Analysis, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Pretests Posttests", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1084731", "title": "Enhancing Learners' Self-Directed Use of Technology for Language Learning: The Effectiveness of an Online Training Platform", "author": "Lai, Chun, Shum, Mark, Tian, Yan", "description": "Enhancing self-directed use of technology for language learning is essential for maximizing the potential of technology for language learning.

Its use, importance, and efficacy in a foreign language learning context could be justifiably debated. However, existing computer-assisted language learning literature is almost silent on the topic. This article reports on a controlled experiment introducing usability of note-taking applications (namely, Evernote, Memonic, SpringPad, Ubernote, and Keeppy) in English as foreign language (EFL) learning context. For pilot testing, 25 students had to complete five scenarios (text editing, entering persuasive content, sharing content, searching, and organizing) using Twitter as a tool similar to note-taking applications. Results suggest that the majority were comfortable with the tasks, although they could not complete all the tasks in the stipulated time, and certain tasks and features in Twitter caused difficulty for some students. The actual testing involved the 10 best candidates (based on their performance, when using Twitter) completing tasks (five scenarios similar to pilot analysis) with any two assigned note-taking applications, from a set of five. Participants were observed, video-recorded, and interviewed concurrently and retrospectively. They also completed perception-based questionnaires on the usability of the software. Data suggested that participants were comfortable opening accounts, typing in text, with general navigation, choosing photos, etc. A few features, such as web clipping and file uploading, caused problems for some participants.

Four subtests from Woodcock Munoz Language Survey-Revised (WMLS-R), a norm-referenced, standardized instrument, were selected to monitor participants' oral English development. A total of 76 urban, rural, and urban/marginal schools with 816 third graders were included in the analysis through multilevel modeling. Results suggested that (1) students held very limited oral English proficiency at the beginning of the third grade; (2) although students significantly improved their oral English proficiency during the 25-week intervention, they were still significantly below the typical native English-speaking norm at the end of the third-grade level; (3) those who were exposed to CALL modules in Treatment A developed at a faster rate than did students in Treatment B and in Control classrooms in lexical knowledge and listening skills when statistically controlling for student-level variables, including initial level and time-on-task; (4) although students in CALL intervention (especially in Treatment B) started with a lower level of oral English proficiency, their gain was numerically higher than that in the Control condition; and (5) time-on-task demonstrated to be an irrelevant variable in the study.

The paper describes a collaborative online project between students from China and the USA, who communicated using the discussion board and e-mail tools on blackboard for tutoring and learning different aspects of English grammar and for developing culture awareness. Twenty-three American students from an ESL teaching program were paired up with 26 Chinese first-year English majors and tutored them on grammar structures that they selected after analyzing the Chinese students' introductory essays on American life and culture for grammar mistakes. The tutorials addressed specific grammar points and were presented through texts that described different aspects of American culture. The Chinese students used the discussion board and e-mail as well as Skype to communicate with their American partners and at the end of the project wrote a second essay on the same topic which was analyzed for grammar errors by the American students. The results from analyzing the students' postings, essays, and interviews suggest that the two groups benefited in three areas: (1) improving teaching skills through tutoring non-native speakers of English; (2) developing cross-cultural awareness; and (3) improving non-native speakers' language skills.

To achieve this aim, CALL employs technological innovations to create novel types of language practice. Evaluations of the new practice types serve the important role of distinguishing effective practice environments from less effective environments, while simultaneously informing educational practices and second language acquisition (SLA) theory. Accordingly, evaluations of CALL systems necessarily deal with multiple criteria. Most researchers would probably agree that motivation is an important criterion in CALL evaluations: a system can provide sufficient L2 input and opportunities for L2 output, yet fail to be pedagogically effective if learners are unwilling to participate. Furthermore, knowledge of the motivational impact of practice can provide valuable context linking individual language learners, practice effort and learning outcomes. From the perspective of recent theoretical developments in L2 motivation theory, this paper surveys a representative sample of CALL system evaluations that include motivational impact. Our analysis suggests not only that CALL needs to do more to align its treatment of motivation with recent L2 motivation theories, but also that it is well positioned to do so. We find that: (1) few CALL studies treat motivation as it relates to practice as a dynamic variable; (2) behavioural practice logs are underexploited; and (3) very few evaluations take into account learners' individual interests and goals. Drawing on these and other findings, we suggest four new directions for developing the motivation dimension in CALL evaluations.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Program Evaluation, Predictor Variables, Student Behavior, Student Interests, Goal Orientation, Computer Assisted Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1103539", "title": "Autonomous Learning through Task-Based Instruction in Fully Online Language Courses", "author": "Lee, Lina", "description": "This study investigated the affordances for autonomous learning in a fully online learning environment involving the implementation of task-based instruction in conjunction with Web 2.0 technologies.

Like other online journals started in the 1990s, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to enhance the speed of publication and the accessibility of published research. Yet &quot;LLT&quot; had an additional goal: to raise the rigor of published research in its targeted area. Thus, rather than seeking to be defined principally by its mode or style of publication, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to be the highest quality journal in an emerging area of inquiry. This sounds like an obvious goal, but &quot;LLT&quot; was going against the grain. By the time the first issue of &quot;LLT&quot; appeared in 1997, there was already a popular notion of a dichotomy between print journals (which alone printed rigorous peer reviewed research) and online journals (which were accessible but not rigorously reviewed). Indeed, at the time, many academics refused to submit work to online journals, believing (or knowing) that their institutions would fail to recognize articles published in online venues. To break out of this stereotype, &quot;LLT&quot; recruited a top notch editorial board, including leading applied linguistics from around the world. For its inaugural issue in July 1997, the journal invited internationally recognized applied linguistics to submit papers on the topic Language Learning &amp; Technology: Defining the Research Agenda. The resources of the NFLRC and CLEAR were used to achieve broad publicity. &quot;LLT&quot; quickly gathered broad attention. With questions of funding, peer review, and other matters still under debate, the future of academic journal publishing is very much in flux.

Participants found waveform displays very helpful. Vowel type, preceding consonant, and pitch pattern significantly affected perception in testing and training as did the training talker's voice. The easiest pitch pattern was Low-High in the first syllable, perhaps reflecting English prosodic preference, and High--High in the second, which may be more salient.

In addition to more travel options and greater technology availability, study abroad has changed in other significant ways. In the US, more students are going abroad for short-term programs (less than 8 weeks), and the participants represent more diverse academic fields, with an increasing number of students from the sciences, social sciences, and business-related fields. The image of the North American student going abroad primarily for language learning, spending a semester or more, no longer fits reality.

Scholars in computer-mediated second language (L2) learning have called for research to fill in this gap by reflecting critically on task design and the subsequent implementation process (Fuchs, Hauck &amp; M\u00fcller-Hartmann, 2012; Hampel, 2010; Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006; Hampel &amp; Plaines, 2013; Hauck, 2010), instead of considering a task an &quot;unproblematic fait accompli&quot; (O'Dowd &amp; Ware, 2009: 174). In response to this charge, the present case study provides a critical analysis of tasks carried out in a first-year German language course built around the weekly TV-series, &quot;Rosenheim-Cops&quot; (ZDF). These tasks drew from research on multimodality (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Norris &amp; Maier, 2014) providing a framework for understanding how multiple semiotic systems work together to create meaning. The insights provided by this study have relevance for research on multimodal task design (Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006) through examining the possibilities and limitations of beginner second language (L2) learners' effective use of authentic resources. The results suggest that the tasks encouraged semiotic awareness, helped activate referential knowledge useful for accessing multimodal resources, and elicited a positive response to authentic L2 use in context.

The study employed a pretest-posttest design with intact third- and fourth-semester classes for German as a foreign language at a US university.

The results show that, whereas the DDL method and the traditional method were both effective and resulted in lexical and grammatical gains, DDL was more effective for teaching new collocations.

Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, screen shot data, and students' post-course interviews, it was found, firstly, that while a head and shoulders framing shot was favoured by the trainee teachers, there does not appear to be an optimal framing choice for desktop videoconferencing among the three framing types identified. Secondly, there was a loss between the number of gestures performed by the trainee teachers and those that were visible for the students. Thirdly, when trainee teachers were able to coordinate the audio and kinesic modalities, communicative gestures that were framed, and held long enough to be perceived by the learners, were more likely to be valuable for mutual comprehension.

A survey was therefore conducted to examine 172 in-service Hakka language teachers' perceptions of TPACK in Taiwan. The survey framework includes seven constructs: content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), technological knowledge (TK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), and TPACK. According to the results, although the native language teachers were satisfied with their TPACK on average, they had relatively low confidence in CK, TK, and TPK. While the older male teachers tended to be more confident in their CK, the older female teachers were inclined to have less confidence in their TK. Teaching experience was positively related to the teachers' perceived CK, PK, and PCK. Particularly, the importance of the teachers' TCK, PK, and TK in their synthesized TPACK was identified.

Almost invariably, these publications account for the observed benefits with reference to Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory,&quot; suggesting it is the visual illustration of word meaning that enhances the quality of processing and hence makes new words more memorable. In this discussion article, we explore the possibility that it is not necessarily the multimodality &quot;per se&quot; that accounts for the reported benefits. Instead, we argue that the provision of multimodal annotations is one of several possible means of inviting more and/or longer attention to the annotations--with amounts of attention given to words being a significant predictor of their retention in memory. After reviewing the available research on the subject and questioning whether invoking Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory&quot; is an optimal account for reported findings, we report an eye-tracking study the results of which are consistent with the alternative thesis that the advantage of multimodal glosses for word learning lies with the greater quantity of attention these glosses attract in comparison with single-mode glosses.

However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students' written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher's feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, and at the same time does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.

To facilitate Chinese writing, non-native learners need to use aspects of the radical knowledge as cues to encode characters, from which the contents of the game were built up for SSAHLC to master the Chinese written forms by playing the CRLG with gesture-based interactions. In addition, the game was used to explore the students' intrinsic motivation relevant to online learning self-efficacy, as well as the experience of flow, to predict the degree of learning progress. Data were collected from 78 SSAHLC participating in the study, and 73 valid questionnaires were returned.

Unlike conventional full captioning, which provides the full text and allows comprehension of the material merely by reading, PSC promotes listening to the speech by presenting a selected subset of words, where each word is synched to its corresponding speech signal. In this method, word-level synchronization is realized by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, dedicated to the desired corpora. This feature allows the learners to become familiar with the correspondences between words and their utterances. Partialization is done by automatically selecting words or phrases likely to hinder listening comprehension. In this work we presume that the incidence of infrequent or specific words and fast delivery of speech are major barriers to listening comprehension. The word selection criteria are thus based on three factors: speech rate, word frequency and specificity. The thresholds for these features are adjusted to the proficiency level of the learners. The selected words are presented to aid listening comprehension while the remaining words are masked in order to keep learners listening to the audio. PSC was evaluated against no-captioning and full-captioning conditions using TED videos. The results indicate that PSC leads to the same level of comprehension as the full-captioning method while presenting less than 30% of the transcript.

If attainment is understood as learner engagement in synchronous, collaborative, spoken interaction which is thought to lead to gains in second language acquisition (SLA), then design considerations that harness learners' agency towards that end is important. This study explores the relationship between learner agency and two different task types, namely an information-gap task and an opinion-sharing task in two peer-to-peer synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) spoken interaction events. Students' choices and how students act on these choices during tasks are analysed using a discourse analysis approach. Audio recordings of four dyads as cases were examined using three analytical dimensions: language functions of verbal interaction, cognitive processing and social processing. The results show that most learners used their agency to reconfigure the tasks from spontaneous to planned interaction, with some choices and actions relating to technology impacting detrimentally on interaction time in the target language. The different tasks were found to filter and channel different types of agency that learners could exercise, namely representational, organisational, and strategic agency as speech acts, and directional agency as a physical act.

Throughout the 12 weeks of treatment, the participants in the experimental group received 120 text messages containing grammar exercises, whereas the participants in the comparison group received a similar number of vocabulary messages as a placebo treatment and were otherwise treated exactly the same as the experimental group. A researcher-made grammar test was used to estimate whether presenting grammar exercises via text messages has any impact on language learners' grammar learning. The results demonstrated that there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in the grammar learning of the participants who practiced grammar points through text messages and those who did not. The researchers also interviewed various stakeholders, comprising ten students, five parents, the teacher, and the school principal. A qualitative content analysis was carried out to find themes relevant to the stakeholders' beliefs about making use of text messages for learning grammar. The findings suggest that text messages can be useful for learning grammar points, since they engage learners' interest and encourage them to study more in order to text the correct answers when they are outside their classrooms.", "subject": "Grammar, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Tests, Experimental Groups, Vocabulary Development, Comparative Analysis, Telecommunications, Synchronous Communication, Foreign Countries, Interviews, Qualitative Research, Content Analysis, Principals, Teacher Attitudes, Student Attitudes, Administrator Attitudes, Control Groups, Secondary School Students, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": "Iran"}, {"id": "EJ1151184", "title": "Exploring Collaborative Reverse Subtitling for the Enhancement of Written Production Activities in English as a Second Language", "author": "Talav\u00e1n, Noa, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Ana, B\u00e1rcena, Elena", "description": "This article explores the effects of collaborative reverse subtitling as an activity for the promotion of writing skills in English as a second language.

Data from activity logs and researcher field notes were triangulated with participants' responses to two surveys and a semi-structured oral interview. Findings indicated that participants believed that VT supported their oral proficiency development through the provision of additional time and resources for independent planning, rehearsal, and controlled production of L2 forms. Most participants also agreed that VT's playback and record features were the most beneficial for developing language skills, enhancing the reflection process, and facilitating self-assessment and creativity in the L2. Yet, despite VT's multimodal affordances and the availability of communicative tasks via VT, participants did not perceive VT as a social environment that could promote peer-to-peer interaction or replace F2F communication.

In the literature lesson, a permanent side floor is established by Turkish-German bilinguals alongside the main floor. To describe this type of floor, the term \"tangential floor\" is proposed. An analysis of turns in the two lessons reveals that the code-switching by the bilinguals contributes to the shaping and unfolding of floor.

As teachers reorient themselves to advising, their role changes quite markedly from teaching language to advising on learning (Mozzon-McPherson, 2001). This challenging move requires professional development training to support and ease the shift in professional roles (Hafner and Young, 2007). As part of the professional development for advisors at Kanda University of International Studies (KUIS) in Japan, advisors undertake a series of &quot;observations&quot; where they record and reflect on advising sessions. An analysis of these reflections was undertaken with a view to identifying common themes which provide important insights and practical implications for teachers considering advising and those involved in professional development for educators. The findings of the study show that the skills most commonly referred to are goal-setting, guiding, questioning and attending. A further skill of negotiation of meaning was also observed as being important in successful advising sessions. A greater understanding of these skills can inform language teachers who take on learning advisor roles.

The investigation was conducted in a Japanese university and involved students on an OC course that employed a task-based approach.

In both cases, however, the process of acquisition is non-linear, and may also be influenced by other factors, such as teaching input, natural orders of acquisition and individual differences. The findings also suggest that since certain error types, such as spelling, verb tense and word choice, are more persistent than others, correction codes may be usefully combined with written comments providing appropriate depth of feedback.

Results show that short video-pills are the most powerful learning objects in this type of online courses, the regular submission of automated grading activities is a robust indicator towards course success, and the most prominent student profile in LMOOCs is 'viewers', those who access the learning materials but do not submit tasks or engage in online interaction actively, which would explain why the completion rate in LMOOCs is so low. This novel perspective into students' language learning, which big data has assisted us in, should guide course creators to re-design the LMOOC for the enhancement of the audio-visual content. LMOOC instructors and facilitators should also encourage participants to increase the submission of activities--acknowledging these small achievements through micro-credentialing and badges-, and special attention ought to be paid to the most prominent LMOOC profile, those 'viewers' who should be lured into becoming 'solvers' or, even better, 'all-rounders'.", "subject": "Large Group Instruction, Online Courses, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Second Language Instruction, Interaction, Computer Mediated Communication, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Educational Research, Resource Units, Correlation, Student Characteristics, Video Technology, Student Participation, Age Differences, Multiple Intelligences, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1175408", "title": "Statistically-Driven Visualizations of Student Interactions with a French Online Course Video", "author": "Youngs, Bonnie L., Prakash, Akhil, Nugent, Rebecca", "description": "Logged tracking data for online courses are generally not available to instructors, students, and course designers and developers, and even if these data were available, most content-oriented instructors do not have the skill set to analyze them.

This difference was attributed to the tandem approach which emphasizes training in how to give feedback as well as school culture. Differences between the amount of feedback provided during the ESL and FSL exchanges were also observed. Here, too, the influence of school culture appears to have been a factor.

However, how learners undertake such negotiation work and what kind of an impact it has on interactional development in an L2 are still largely unknown mainly due to a lack of focus on task engagement processes. A conversation analytic investigation into negotiation of meaning (NoM) in task-oriented interactions can bring evidence to such development, as conversation analysis (CA), given its analytic tools, allows us to see how participant orientations in interaction evolve over time. Based on an examination of screen-recorded multiparty online task-oriented interactions, this study aimed to describe how users (n=8) of an L2 (1) negotiate and co-construct language and task rules and (2) later show orientations to these rules both in the short term (50 minutes) and in the long term (8 weeks). The findings showed that in addition to negotiating existing rules, the learners co-constructed new rules around an action called policing, which occurred when the learners attended to the breach of language and task rules. Furthermore, even after the negotiation work was completed, they oriented to negotiated rules through policing their own utterances (i.e. self-policing). Overall, this interactional continuum (from other-repairs to self-repairs) brought longitudinal evidence to bear on the role of NoM in the development of L2 interactional competence. These findings bring new insights into NoM, technology-mediated task-based language teaching (TBLT), and CA for second language acquisition (SLA).", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Interaction, Language Usage, Standards, Error Correction, Language Skills, Communication Skills, Computer Mediated Communication, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1187528", "title": "Effectiveness of Computer-Assisted Argument Mapping for Comprehension, Recall, and Retention", "author": "Eftekhari, Maryam, Sotoudehnama, Elaheh", "description": "Compared to traditional pen-and-paper presentation of information, computer-assisted argument mapping seems to be more efficient in developing lower order thinking skills such as memory and comprehension.

Overcoming the weaknesses commonly associated with traditional narrative review and vote counting, meta-analysis is a statistical method of systematically aggregating and analyzing empirical studies by following well-established procedures. The findings of a meta-analysis, when appropriately conducted, are able to inform important policy decisions and provide practical pedagogical suggestions. With the growing number of publications employing meta-analysis across a wide variety of disciplines, it has received criticism due to its inconsistent findings derived from multiple meta-analyses in the same research domain. These inconsistencies have arisen partly due to the alternatives available to meta-analysts in each major meta-analytic procedure. Researchers have therefore recommended transparent reporting on the decision-making for every essential judgment call so that the results across multiple meta-analyses become replicable, consistent, and interpretable. This research explored the degree to which meta-analyses in the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) discipline transparently reported their decisions in every critical step. To achieve this aim, we retrieved 15 eligible meta-analyses in CALL published between 2003 and 2015. Features of these meta-analyses were extracted based on a codebook modified from Cooper (2003) and Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou and Kern (2012). A transparency score of reporting was then calculated to examine the degree to which these meta-analyses are compliant with the norms of reporting as recommended in the literature.

Using a mixed research method, this study examined the under-researched relationship between learners' online self-regulation and their attitude toward learning through wiki-based literature circles activities. Quantitative data were collected from two surveys, the online self-regulated English learning (OSEL) and the attitude toward wiki-based literature circles (AWLC), among 228 university students in China. Qualitative data were collected from a follow-up interview of 13 participants to explore further the interplay between the students' online self-regulation and their attitude. The results indicated that students hold positive attitude toward learning through wiki-based literature circles in terms of perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, affection, and behavior. The findings partially confirmed the positive correlations between students' self-regulated learning strategies and their attitudes. More interestingly, stepwise regression analysis revealed that students' goal setting acted as a significant predicator of their perceived usefulness of and self-efficacy in completing wiki-based literature circles activities. Self-evaluation was found to be the variable to predict the learners' affection for and behavior in doing this task.

Traditionally, this involves assigning a one-dimensional label to the text that identifies the grade or proficiency level of the learners that the text is intended for. Such an approach is inadequate given that both the text complexity and proficiency constructs are multi-dimensional in nature. We propose to instead link readers and texts through multidimensional vectors characterizing the linguistic complexity of the reading material and that of texts written by the learners as proxy of their proficiency level. We first validate the approach using a leveled reading corpus by showing that vector distances computed on the complexity representations can serve the function of the traditional labels. We then highlight the advantage of the multi-dimensional approach using data from a continuation writing task, showing that it makes it possible to study individual complexity dimensions and to explore different degrees of challenge for different dimensions.

Many teachers do not know how to teach correct pronunciation due to lack of knowledge in pronunciation pedagogy even if they want to or they assume that students pick it up on their own. With the development of technology, automatic speech recognition (ASR) software has been adopted in computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) and has been found to be effective in facilitating pronunciation learning. Nevertheless, CAPT software still has its limitation. Very little research has been done on what difficulties students may encounter during practice with the system, such as how to read the feedback provided by the software. Moreover, very few CAPT studies investigated how collaborative learning can be integrated to augment the advantages of the technology. Efforts also have to be made on how to increase the enjoyment of learners using it when their motivation is curtailed by the unchanging feedback the CAPT system provides.

Two dyads and two triads of students conducted synchronous audiovisual interviews with Berlin-based entrepreneurs in order to expand upon their existing knowledge of German business culture. The study examines the extent to which L2 German learners were able to perform the genre 'oral interview' via synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and whether performance afforded learners the opportunity to: 1) display previously acquired content knowledge and 2) acquire new content knowledge. Discourse analysis of four hours of transcribed speech shows that all groups were able to navigate the generic stages of the oral interview. Furthermore, participants used both explicit and implicit means to refer to knowledge gained prior to the exchange and during the exchange.

The results show significant interdisciplinary and inter-/intra-user trends and variation in the use of particular corpus functions and query syntax adopted by corpus users. Students varied in the type of knowledge (e.g. domain-specific, language-specific) they were accessing, and frequently went beyond the exemplars of the DDL course materials to generate unique queries under their own initiative.

Failure to present an effective authorial stance often results in poor evaluation, which compromises a writer's research potential. This study proposes a \"textlinguistic\" approach to advanced academic writing to complement a typical corpus approach that is oriented toward exploring lexico-grammatical patterns at the sentence level. A web-based stance corpus was developed which allowed the users to study both the linguistic realizations of stance at clause/sentence level and how stance meanings are made at the rhetorical move level. The assumptions the study tested included: (1) whether a textlinguistic approach assists L2 writers to polish their research argument particularly as a result of improved stance deployment, and (2) whether the web-based corpus tool affords a constructivist environment which prompts the learners to infer linguistic patterns to attain deeper understanding. Seven L2 doctoral students in the social sciences were recruited. The results indicate a positive relationship between writing performance and more accurate use of stance. However, the application of higher order cognitive skills (e.g., inferring and verifying) was infrequent in the corpus environment. Instead, the writers used more lower-level cognitive skills (e.g., making sense and exploring) to learn. The participants accessed the integrated \"context examples\" most frequently to guide their learning, followed by rhetorical \"move examples\" and clause-based \"stance examples\". This suggests that the learning of stance is critically contingent on the surrounding contexts.

Also, as CF can be perceived as a measure of performance, it could harm learners' perception of competence. Eighty-three learners of English as a foreign language participated in a mixed-method experimental study that aimed to first explore the perceived usefulness of, and preferences for, explicit and implicit CF in an immersive educational game, and to secondly chart the relation between learners' perceptions of CF as they pertain to three individual difference factors related to learners' self-perception, namely intrinsic goal orientation, perceived competence and game experience. Survey and interview data showed that CF was found to be generally useful. A regression model indicated that the three measures of self-perception affected learners' perceptions of explicit CF positively, and that there was no impact on perceptions of implicit CF. Further, learners reported having enjoyed the implicit CF, although they did not find it particularly useful for learning.

This empirical study seeks to answer the following question: What is the nature of the linguistic ecology that &quot;WoW&quot; players are exposed to? Many studies have described the developmental opportunities presented by commercially available gaming environments (e.g., Gee, 2003, 2007), their value as sites of literacy development (e.g., Squire, 2008a; Steinkuehler, 2008), and their potential as venues for second language (L2) use and learning (e.g., Peterson, 2010; Thorne, Black, &amp; Sykes, 2009; Thorne &amp; Fischer, 2012; Zheng, Young, Wagner &amp; Brewer, 2009).

This primarily descriptive research addresses this issue and aims to finely characterize the linguistic complexity of game-presented texts (or &quot;quest texts&quot;) as well as player generated game-external informational and strategy websites that form the expansive semiotic ecology of &quot;WoW&quot; game play. Questionnaires and interviews with Dutch and American gamers helped to identify a variety of widely used game-external websites. This information then informed the selection of texts that were analyzed for their linguistic complexity.

Claims have been made that certain games, in particular massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) provide L2 English learners with a linguistically rich and cognitively challenging virtual environment that may be conducive to L2 learning, as learners get ample opportunities for L2 input and scaffolded interaction in the L2. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that L2 English proficiency correlates with the frequency of gaming and types of games played. We base our observation on a study among young L2 English learners (N = 86, aged 11-12, Sweden). Data were collected through a questionnaire, a language diary, and three proficiency tests. The questionnaire provided demographic background information but was also targeted at measuring extramural English habits, i.e., learners' out-of-school contact with English (cf. Sundqvist, 2009). The diary measured how much time the learners spent on seven predetermined extramural English activities during one week, while the tests measured their achieved L2 proficiency regarding reading and listening comprehension, and vocabulary. Previous research among learners aged 15-16 (Sundqvist, 2009) showed positive correlations between playing digital games and L2 proficiency, in particular with regard to vocabulary, and also identified gender-related differences regarding vocabulary (boys outperformed girls) as well as the frequency of gaming and types of games played. These results were corroborated in the present study. A clear pattern emerged from our data: frequent gamers (greater than or equal to 5 hours/week) outperformed moderate gamers who, in turn, outperformed non-gamers. Background variables could not explain the between-group differences.

We expand on the basic notion of CALL as a potential transdisciplinary field and provide a descriptive framework of transdisciplinary types. The final section offers a model for visualizing transdisciplinarity for CALL with accompanying examples, arguing for a set of common transdisciplinary notions and a lingua franca for CALL stakeholders from a range of disciplines to use when communicating.

To keep leaners motivated and engaged, innovative pedagogies have been proposed, among which flipped learning and writing instruction have received extra attention. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of flipped learning and online writing practices on enhancing student motivation and learning outcomes. Nonetheless, research on how the aforementioned instructional practices could be integrated to facilitate English writing among EFL learners still remains scarce, let alone a detailed probe into demotivational factors that might exist in such an innovative instructional design.

Nevertheless, this industry subscribes to an assumption that native speaker English teachers (NESTs) are the gold standard of language whereas the non-native speaker English teachers (NNESTs) are inferior educators (Walkinshaw &amp; Duong, 2014). Rare research has provided evidence of the negotiation produced by NESTs versus NNESTs with EFL learners online and its impact on the learners' output. Thus, the current study narrows this empirical gap. Drawing upon a database of 30 five-minute interaction sessions between 30 teachers (15 NESTs and 15 NNESTs) and 30 basic level Vietnamese EFL adult learners, the study revealed similar negotiation of meaning functions as reported in previous research. However, the NESTs used more elaboration while the NNESTs used more confirmation checks, clarification requests, and reply clarification. Qualitative analysis further indicated that the NNESTs provided more productive support, encouraging the learners' output, than the NESTs did.

Consequently, fewer articles are published on a large number of CALL topics or, in some cases, rarely studied. The research methods employed are rigorous: in writing, structure, theory, literature awareness, and discussion and presentation of results, yet there are still weaknesses. Most empirical studies are small scale: based on one institution, a small cohort of students, over a short period of time and seldom followed up. Based on these findings, suggestions are made with a view to broadening and strengthening CALL research through targeting neglected strategic areas with special journal issues and conferences, and improving the quality of research projects.

However, one-on-one and multiple-to-multiple interactions did differ with regard to the quality of the interactions, reflecting the unique nature of each group composition. A one-on-one relationship promoted a higher level of intimacy and friendship, thus rendering it appropriate for providing linguistic and emotional support in learning foreign languages.

Multimodality has been explored from a number of angles relating to computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as its affordances and impact on language learners, highlighting its relevance and importance in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Because CMC scenarios require attending to both peers and the screen, learners can be seen as positioned as &quot;semiotic initiators and responders&quot; (Coffin &amp; Donohue, 2014). Increasingly, researchers are highlighting a need for a methodological &quot;turn&quot; to analyse this scenario from a &quot;language&quot; focus to a more holistic understanding of the interactions (Flewitt, 2008; Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006; Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Lamy, 2006).

Planning mitigates the cognitive overload placed upon L2 learners' oral performance, thus improving language production. Despite the pedagogical benefits, studies on pre-task planning on L2 learners' oral output are conducted mostly in a lab or class setting. Whether or not similar effects of pre-task planning can be evidenced in three-dimensional (3D) multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs), such as Second Life (SL), is still less explored. Hence, this study investigates whether pre-task planning could enhance the quality and quantity of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' task-oriented, voice-based outcomes in SL. Nine EFL learners worldwide participated in this 10-session virtual class. Data were collected through students' oral presentations in performing real-life simulated tasks related to their home cultures and interests. Yuan and Ellis's (2003) framework of T-units measures was adopted to analyze their linguistic performance measured by complexity and accuracy. Results indicated that EFL learners showed statistically significant improvement on grammatical complexity on the levels of syntactic complexity and variety (but not on lexical variety) and on linguistic accuracy across all measured levels (error-free clauses/T-units/verb forms). It is suggested that pre-task planning can be seeded in task-based instruction either in a classroom-based or 3D MUVE setting to optimize the quality of learners' linguistic performance.

It uses an analysis of CALL-related papers to demonstrate how far CALL is impacted by a monolingual bias that it inherited from language learning pedagogy. An analysis of articles from four CALL journals across 10 years shows that although the words &quot;bilingual&quot; and &quot;multilingual&quot; appear in these journals fairly regularly, terms such as &quot;plurilingual, third language, tertiary language, L3, translanguaging,&quot; and &quot;translingual&quot; are extremely rare. Also, only eight articles could be identified that use any of these eight keywords in their title. Trends across those papers are identified. In a discussion of existing CALL products and projects that incorporate more than one language, it is argued that while commercial products often include more than one language, this is frequently in a behaviorist or grammar-translation tradition, while innovative plurilingual products and projects tend to be non-commercial and often EU/EC-funded initiatives.

Fifty-two students of French as a foreign language were divided into one control and two experimental groups. The two experimental groups were invited to engage in voluntary language learning through a language platform, Duolingo. One of the two experimental groups was trained for self-regulation and received scaffolding for their MALL. The study reveals five main findings: First, students who were trained in self-regulation and received temporary scaffolding present a significantly higher participation in Duolingo. Second, self-regulation features provided by Duolingo are not frequently used by students and therefore do not substantially contribute to students' own learning micromanagement. Third, there is a correlation between high use of Duolingo and improvement in French writing skills. Fourth, just inviting students to engage in voluntary out-of-class MALL does not result in higher test scores for French listening, reading or writing skills. Fifth, in a MALL context, self-regulation training and temporary scaffolding contribute to higher test scores in French writing.

The results show that &quot;passing exams&quot; was the top reason for using MELR and expanding one's English vocabulary was the aspect learners aimed to improve.

Specifically, a document co-citation analysis revealed a number of major research clusters, their key topics, connections, and bursts (sudden citation surges). For example, the foci of clusters #0 through #5 were found to be perceptual learning, regressive eye movement(s), attributive adjective(s), stereotypical gender, discourse processing, and bilingual adult(s). The content of all the major clusters was closely examined and synthesized in the form of an in-depth review. Finally, we grounded the findings within a data-driven theory of scientific revolution and discussed how the observed patterns have contributed to the emergence of new trends. As the first scientometric investigation of eye tracking research in language studies, the present study offers several implications for future research that are discussed.", "subject": "Eye Movements, Sex Stereotypes, Research Reports, Trend Analysis, Perceptual Development, Language Processing, Adults, Bilingualism, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Journal Articles, Language Research, Citation Analysis, Form Classes (Languages), Attention, Affective Behavior", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2021, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1317923", "title": "Using Gamification to Support Learning English as a Second Language: A Systematic Review", "author": "Dehghanzadeh, Hojjat, Fardanesh, Hashem, Hatami, Javad, Talaee, Ebrahim, Noroozi, Omid", "description": "Digital gamification has been argued to be a fun and enjoyable method to support Learning English as a Second Language (LESL) and to ease the gap between students' learning and educational practice.

The findings suggest that using this tool can lead not only to intervention with low-achieving students but can also determine if students struggle due to poor course materials.", "subject": "French, Online Courses, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Visualization, High Stakes Tests, Summative Evaluation, Formative Evaluation, Educational Quality, Instructional Materials, Decision Making, Teaching Methods, Intervention, Low Achievement, Undergraduate Students, Introductory Courses, Course Evaluation, Learning Analytics", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2021, "identifiersgeo": "Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh)"}, {"id": "EJ1295140", "title": "Lexical Complexity, Writing Proficiency, and Task Effects in Spanish Dual Language Immersion", "author": "Schnur, Erin, Rubio, Fernando", "description": "Using the 2.4-million-word written Spanish subsection of the Corpus of Utah Dual Language Immersion, collected from a large-scale standardized writing assessment of K-12 Spanish second language (L2) students, this study focuses on lexical complexity as operationalized by three measures: lexical diversity, lexical density, and lexical sophistication.

A total of 96 EFL learners watched three vlogs under one of three conditions: L2 captions, L1 captions, and no captions. Each group included low-, mid-, and high-level proficiency learners. The vlogs differed in the pictorial support of the audio, with Vlog 1 being highly supported, Vlog 2 being partially supported, and Vlog 3 being slightly supported by pictorial images. After each vlog, the participants took a multiple-choice test measuring their comprehension of details. Afterwards, participants completed a questionnaire about their perception of captions. The findings suggest that the availability of captions may not necessarily lead to better listening comprehension because students, particularly lower proficiency learners, were unable to simultaneously process the multiple modalities (images, audio, and captions) due to their limited capacities of working memory and cognitive load. High-proficiency learners achieved better comprehension than low-and mid-proficiency learners and achieved their best comprehension with L2 captions. A significant increase in comprehension of vlogs caused by high pictorial support was detected, with the inverse relationship also being true. Analysis of the questionnaire indicated that participants consider L2 captions useful. For both L2 and L1 captions, students think that their listening comprehension would decrease without captions. When considering vlogs for L2 listening, language proficiency and pictorial support are better indicators of levels of comprehension.

Following a design-based research approach, this paper presents an analysis and discussion of seven components of the design: learning environment, facilitation dynamics, dyad configuration, task types, task topics, feedback provision, and gamification components. The analysis of the implementation of these elements results in a set of key features for the integration of L2 speaking interaction activities in LMOOCs.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Online Courses, Computer Mediated Communication, Intercultural Communication, Instructional Design, Integrated Activities", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2021, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1292238", "title": "What Makes a Good-Quality Language MOOC?

The course, Irish 101, ran during March 2019, and we used a mixed-methods approach to analyse both typical patterns of behaviour among course participants and learner reflections upon their reasons for doing so. Findings suggest that most learners use the course resources in an assessing and exploratory manner and are far less likely to produce, or to examine, second language (L2) output, either written or spoken. Learners were found to be selective and to demonstrate significant metacognitive awareness (Wenden, 1998) in their interactions and learning methods, displaying agency and exploiting affordances beyond the design of the course itself.

Hence, interest in narrow reading has been limited by the relatively small lexical effect of narrowing reading by topic (Nation, 2013). Nevertheless, research in data-driven learning and teaching and language corpora has reported positively on learners using concordances in a manner comparable to narrow reading.

This study bridges this gap by exploring the degree of lexical repetition available in concordances and identifies corpus composition as a key predictor of lexical repetition. The study uses standardised type-token ratio (sTTR) to analyse concordances extracted from corpora at three different levels of homogeneity/heterogeneity. The results show large, reliable variations in lexical repetition resulting from variation in corpus homogeneity/heterogeneity, and so identifies concordance-based narrow reading as a possible means of overcoming the limitations of traditional narrow reading by topic.

To verify this hypothesis, we utilized learning materials comprised of static and dynamic images for three English spatial prepositions (&quot;above,&quot; &quot;on,&quot; &quot;over&quot;). After conducting a Style of Processing questionnaire, we administered three cloze tests (pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest) of target words to Taiwanese and Japanese participants (N = 109), whose L1s differed in terms of their linguistic proximity to English. Although no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in tests for all participants, the results were differentiated by individual factors. In results of a two-way ANOVA, Taiwanese participants showed significantly greater improvement from the pretest to posttest than Japanese participants when the participants used dynamic images, whereas the Japanese group made more learning gains from the posttest to the delayed posttest test. Moreover, imagers obtained more benefits from the visual aids, whether static or dynamic, than verbalizers.

To that end, 179 subjects were given an ASR-scored EOR test with 60 items, followed by an oral proficiency interview (OPI) type assessment and a battery of other language tests. Findings suggest that ASR-scored EOR results could be used alone to predict speaking ability in specific situations and for limited purposes such as initial placement of students in language training situations.

The use of an ASR-scored EOR test seems to provide a practical estimate of speaking proficiency that could be used for initial placement of students in situations where assessments of speaking for the purpose of placement are not currently being used due to the cost of administering OPI type assessments.

The study reported here investigated whether using computer software to slow down the tempo of listening input, without reducing its pitch, makes a difference to test takers in &quot;listen-once&quot; tests, measured by both their performance in and their perceptions of the test. In an independent groups design, participants (n=120) took tests reduced in tempo by various amounts. It was found that slower speed input led to increases in performance. The slower the speed of delivery the less likely the participants were to perceive the test as difficult and the less speed became an issue. Although it is unlikely that this technology will lead language testers to modify high-stakes listening test procedures, we conclude that the facility to slow down tempo using freely available technology may be beneficial in classroom and self-directed study contexts as a scaffolding measure as students get used to &quot;once only at normal speed&quot; listening scenarios or prepare for high-stakes tests.

Seeking an alternative to traditional teacher-centered approaches, this paper proposes a social-constructivist model that integrates computer-mediated communication (CMC) and collaborative learning to teach two advanced undergraduate L2 content-based courses--French sociolinguistics and modern French. It reports on the processes and learning outcomes for thirty students who built a wiki, and engaged in other collaborative and active-learning exercises, to develop content knowledge in French. This approach provides an authentic and meaningful language learning setting and integrates technology-assisted collaborative learning in syllabus design from the outset. Post-course evaluations indicate that students developed a sense of class community through the collaborative approach and felt engaged with course content. This exploratory, qualitative project also provides insight on the importance of continuous critical instructor feedback for optimal quality of student output and of a system encouraging and controlling equal participation of students.

Students engaged in repeated experiential learning cycles of planning, doing, observing, and evaluating their performance of a role in a strategic interaction scenario. Each performance was digitally video recorded and uploaded to the wiki. Students then used the wiki to evaluate their video performance, transcribe and self-correct their utterances, and reflect on changes in subsequent performances. The instructor used the wiki's video and text to give students online feedback and focus post-performance group debriefing sessions. Comparisons of performance transcripts revealed syntactic, pragmatic, lexical and fluency improvement from learning cycle 1 to learning cycle 2, and observations, surveys, and interviews provide evidence for the students' ease of use of the wiki and video cameras, enjoyment of the instructional activities, and improved independence and confidence.

The review reveals that blogs and wikis have been the most studied Web 2.0 tools, while others, such as social networking applications and virtual worlds, have been less frequently explored. In addition, the most commonly investigated languages have been English, Spanish, German, and French. Considerably less research has been conducted on applying Web 2.0 technologies to less commonly taught languages, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Russian. Additionally, the language learning environments afforded by Web 2.0 technologies have greatly broadened the scope of topics explored in computer-assisted language learning (CALL): from earlier research which tended to concentrate on the traditional four broad language skills, to more recent topics, such as learners' identities, online collaboration, and learning communities. Although very few studies surveyed have actually examined students' progress and learning outcomes associated with these tools, the most frequently reported benefit associated with Web 2.0 technologies is the favorable language learning environments they help to foster.

A total of 79 students participated in the experiment, and they were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used a mobile-assisted English learning system to learn. Then, they filled out a questionnaire and evaluated whether the system's operations and their motivation, English anxiety, and perceived usefulness affected their learning achievement. The experimental results indicate that the mobile-assisted English learning system benefits students' learning achievement. Moreover, students with lower levels of English anxiety have better learning achievement than those with higher levels of English anxiety, and higher levels of perceived usefulness result in better learning achievement.

The results highlighted the different effects of FTF and CM contexts on learners' pace, depth and permanency of development through not only employing different mediation forms but also encouraging the usage of different mediational tools. The findings indicated that while FTF mediation led to an inclination toward collaborative writing, CM mediation increased learners' engagement with their written texts by focusing more on difficult items and transferring development to other tasks and situations which, in turn, illustrates their progression towards self-regulation.

As is speculated, student revisions will then be positively impacted. However, little evidence has supported these claims, calling into question the impact of AWE on teaching and learning. The current study explored these claims by comparing two second language writing classes that were assigned to either an AWE + teacher feedback condition or a teacher-only-feedback condition. Findings suggest that using AWE as a complement to teacher feedback did not have a significant impact on the amount of HL teacher feedback, but the teacher who did not use AWE tended to provide a greater amount of LL feedback than AWE alone. Furthermore, students seemed to revise the teacher's LL feedback more frequently than LL feedback from the computer. Interestingly, students retained their improvement in accuracy in the long-term when they had access to AWE, but students who did not have access appeared to have lower retention.

A total of 364 junior high school students, 20 junior high school teachers, and three Directors of the Ministry of Education of Iran participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis was run to ensure the construct validity of the questionnaire. The results of the Mann-Whitney U test showed significant differences between the perceptions of the teachers and students. While the students and teachers reported that students had an acceptable level of digital literacy in the interviews, the questionnaire results showed that the students had a low to moderate level of digital literacy. The teachers and students believed that the junior high school students used technology for recreational and non-educational purposes. The junior high school students did not use a wide range of computer applications and software tools. The interview with the Directors of the Ministry of Education depicted that they did not have consensus on the issues related to junior high school students' digital literacy and that the Ministry did not have clear plans for promoting students' digital literacy levels. The study proposes implications for the renewal of the English as a foreign language (EFL) curriculum of junior high schools and the integration of CALL in EFL programs in Iran and other similar contexts.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Junior High School Students, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Computer Literacy, Computer Assisted Instruction, Junior High School Teachers, Administrators, Attitudes, Computer Use, Educational Improvement, Outcomes of Education", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2022, "identifiersgeo": "Iran"}, {"id": "EJ1352576", "title": "Self-Experienced Storytelling in an Authentic Context to Facilitate EFL Writing", "author": "Nguyen, Thi-Huyen, Hwang, Wu-Yuin, Pham, Xuan-Lam, Pham, Thao", "description": "Our study explored EFL writing skills in relation to self-experience in an authentic learning context with the help of a mobile application.

Therefore, this study fills the gap by using a commercial VR app to examine the effect of VR via mobile-rendered HMDs on EFL learners' vocabulary learning. Forty-nine seventh graders in Taiwan were recruited from two intact classes and assigned to either an experimental (VR players) or control (video watchers) group.

The results showed that the VR players' vocabulary learning and retention was significantly higher than the video watchers'. The majority of the VR players felt that VR-mediated vocabulary learning was motivating and beneficial. The VR app contextualized vocabulary learning by providing virtual environments with multimodal support and enhanced learner engagement through real-time interactivity and feedback.

Relatively few studies, most of them focusing on English idioms, have investigated how L2 idioms are actually acquired and how this process is affected by important idiom properties like transparency (the degree to which the figurative meaning of an idiom can be inferred from its literal analysis) and cross-language overlap (the degree to which L2 idioms correspond to L1 idioms). The present study employed a specially designed CALL system to investigate the effects of intensity of practice and the reading modality on learning Dutch L2 idioms, as well as the impact of idiom transparency and cross-language overlap. The results show that CALL practice with a focus on meaning and form is effective for learning L2 idioms and that the degree of practice needed depends on the properties of the idioms. L2 learners can achieve or even exceed native-like performance. Practicing reading idioms aloud does not lead to significantly higher performance than reading idioms silently. These findings have theoretical implications as they show that differences between native speakers and L2 learners are due to differences in exposure, rather than to different underlying acquisition mechanisms.

To fill this research gap, the present review study intends to understand the landscape of TPACK research on language teachers published from 2011 to 2019. The analysis results reveal that 51 studies were identified with a publication peak in 2015, mostly conducted in Asia and the Middle East. The 51 articles were categorized into four areas: (a) exploring TPACK, (b) assessing TPACK, (c) developing TPACK, and (d) applying TPACK. More specifically, research on exploring TPACK suggests that while teachers had varying levels of confidence in their TPACK competence, their TPACK indicated the dominant use of technology in traditional teacher-centered teaching. Research on assessing TPACK shows that survey items were contextualized to lessen the difficulty of distinguishing between the seven sub-domains of TPACK. However, the difficulty remained perhaps due to a possibility that the seven sub-domains may not appear workable in practice. This issue needs further research. Research on developing TPACK reveals that effective interventions involved language teachers' understanding of the TPACK framework, modeling from teacher educators or experienced teachers, and language teachers' engagement in designing lessons collaboratively. Finally, research on applying TPACK indicates that TPACK-informed language learning courses and platforms were perceived to be helpful and effective.

A user study in which 33 adult second language learners practice Swedish in three-party conversations with an anthropomorphic robot head is then presented. It is demonstrated how different robot interaction behaviours influence interaction between the robot and the learners and between the two learners. Through an analysis of learner interaction, collaboration and learner ratings for the different robot behaviours, it is observed that the learners were most positive towards the robot behaviour that focused on interviewing one learner at the time (highest average ratings), but that they were the most active in sessions when the robot encouraged learner-learner interaction. Moreover, the preferences and activity differed between learner pairs, depending on, e.g., their proficiency level and how well they knew the peer.

The findings revealed three forms of appropriation (i.e., regular, partial, and rare) among the students, who had used various artifacts (e.g., dictionary) and rules (e.g., teacher requirement), taken on different roles (e.g., student writer, spotlight-avoider), and resorted to different community members (e.g., peers) to mediate their appropriation.

In contrast to the extant gamification literature focusing on designing reward systems and/or facilitating teachers' gamification of learning contents, this study focuses on the gamifying of learning content by students. To verify the efficacy of gamification as a learning activity, the effects of students posing and gamifying questions in relation to second language grammar learning are explored. A gamification platform called &quot;TipOn&quot; was designed to allow students to pose and gamify questions according to different game modes to facilitate their classmates' practicing English grammar. To examine the emotional regulation effects of posing and gamifying questions on learning performance, this study explored the effectiveness of gamifying content by examining how participants' two types of epistemic curiosity (i.e., interest-type epistemic curiosity (IEC) and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity (DEC)) related to posing questions affected their attitude towards gamification (ATG) and their learning progress. In this experiment, participants had to pose English grammar questions related to verb tense, and gamify the questions using TipOn. They then played games using other students' content. Data were collected from 96 ninth-grade students, and the correlations between constructs were evaluated using the path-analytical technique. The research results indicated that, first, English learning anxiety is negatively related to the two aforementioned types of epistemic curiosity. Second, IEC had no significant impact on ATG; however, DEC was positively associated with ATG. Third, ATG could positively predict students' learning progress.

Moreover, AWCF tools can deliver feedback synchronously, although not instantaneously, as often appears to be the case with MS-NLP. Cognitive theory and recent L2 research suggest that synchronous corrective feedback may aid L2 development, but also that error-flagging at suboptimal times could cause disfluencies in L2 students' writing processes.

To fill this gap, the current study explored the impact of mode of interaction on learners' successful uptake and L2 gains when recasts are provided. Sixty young Greek EFL learners (M = 11.39 years old, SD = 0.86) were assigned to one of two experimental conditions that differed as to whether students engaged in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) or face-to-face (FTF) interaction. Both groups performed information transmission tasks that required them to provide information about habits of fictional characters.

Text recommendation systems typically classify users and documents into levels, and then match users with documents at the same level. Although this approach can be effective, it has two significant shortcomings. First, the levels assume a standard order of language acquisition and cannot be personalized to the users' learning patterns. Second, recommendation decisions are not transparent because the leveling algorithms can be difficult for users to interpret. We propose a novel method for text recommendation that addresses these two issues. To enhance personalization, an open, editable learner model estimates user knowledge of each word in the foreign language. The documents are ranked by new-word density (NWD) -- that is, the percentage of words that are new to the user in the document. The system then recommends documents according to a user-specified target NWD. This design offers complete transparency as users can scrutinize recommendations by reviewing the NWD estimation of the learner model. This article describes an implementation of this method in a mobile app for learners of Chinese as a foreign language. Evaluation results show that users were able to manipulate the learner model and NWD parameters to adjust the difficulty of the recommended documents.

These robot-learner interactions are evaluated through post-session interviews with the learners, teachers' ratings of the robot's behaviour and analyses of the video-recorded conversations, resulting in a set of guidelines for robot-led conversation practice: (1) societal and personal topics increase the practice's meaningfulness for learners; (2) strategies and methods for providing corrective feedback during conversation practice need to be explored further; (3) learners should be encouraged to support each other if the robot has difficulties adapting to their linguistic level; (4) the robot should establish a social relationship by contributing with its own story, remembering the participants' input, and making use of non-verbal communication signals; and (5) improvements are required regarding naturalness and intelligibility of text-to-speech synthesis, in particular its speed, if it is to be used for conversations with L2 learners.", "subject": "Teacher Attitudes, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Robotics, Swedish, Nonverbal Communication, Interpersonal Communication, Teaching Methods, Error Correction, Feedback (Response), Linguistic Input, Language Proficiency, Student Attitudes, Speech Communication", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2022, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1351511", "title": "Meaningful Integration in Professional Communities: Examining User Behaviors in Catalyst", "author": "Knight, Stephanie W.

Participants' speech for all tasks was rated by four native French speakers for comprehensibility. Descriptive statistics are presented. Self-reported anxiety and cortisol data indicated that participants were less anxious in VR and throughout the eight weeks.

Twelve L1 listeners of English transcribed 48 isolated words targeting the /[near-close front unrounded vowel]-i/ and /[near-open front unrounded vowel]-[open-mid front unrounded vowel]/ contrasts and 24 short sentences that four Taiwanese intermediate learners of English had produced using Google's ASR dictation system.

A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html]. Hence, students use the basis of their worldviews to shape and interpret their own meanings in writing. Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.

Drawing on the empirical findings reported in this special issue, she focuses this short commentary on the following motivational issues concerning mobile language learning: (1) Motivation as a matter of choice and autonomy; and (2) Motivation as a matter of personally meaningful casual learning.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Student Interests, Electronic Learning, Educational Technology", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1031160", "title": "Mobile-Assisted Language Learning: A Selected Annotated Bibliography of Implementation Studies 1994-2012", "author": "Burston, Jack", "description": "Over the past 20 years, project implementation descriptions have accounted for the majority of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) publications, some 345 in total.

One way to investigate this is through language experience interviews, in which students are asked to reflect on general and specific aspects of their language experience.

The study reported in this paper builds on the work of Dornyei and colleagues (Dornyei and Csizer, 1998; Cheng and Dornyei, 2007). It uses Cheng and Dornyei's (2007) methods while changing the context to evaluate the relevance of a similar list of motivational strategies to 268 South Korean secondary school EFL teachers. The results provide further evidence that some strategies can transfer across contexts.

Firstly, it seeks to record the technologies in current use by learners of a range of languages at an Australian university in 2011. Data was collected via a large-scale survey of 587 foreign language students across ten languages at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011. The data reported in two studies, one by Conole (2008) and one by Peters, Weinberg and Sarma (2008) are used as points of reference for the comparison with the present study. The findings of the current study point to the autonomy and independence of the language learners in this cohort and the re-emergence of CALL tools, both for in-class and out-of-class learning activities. According to this data set, learners appear to have become more autonomous and independent and much more able to shape and resource their personal language learning experience in a blended learning setting. The students also demonstrate a measure of sophistication in their use of online tools, such that they are able to work around known limitations and constraints.

The recent proliferation of online reading materials has made information easily available to L2 readers; however, L2 readers' ability to deal with them requires the development of specific reading strategies. The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy. The program offers four types of reading strategy functions (Global, Problem-solving, Support, and Socio-affective) through 15 strategy buttons: Keyword, Preview, Prediction, Outline, Summary, Semantic Mapping, Pronunciation, Speed Reading, Dictionary, Translation, Grammar, Highlight, Notebook, Music Box, and My Questions. Forty college teachers and thirty-two EFL students in Taiwan were invited to use and evaluate this program. The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies. This connection suggests that teachers should provide more explicit training to encourage all students to use Global strategies for overall textual understanding.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Language Teachers, Second Language Learning, Teacher Attitudes, Student Attitudes, Reading Strategies, Web Based Instruction, Reading Instruction, Educational Technology, Computer Uses in Education, College Faculty, College Students, Program Effectiveness, Reading Comprehension, Teaching Methods, Student Motivation, Holistic Approach, Reading Skills, Problem Solving, Social Influences, Computer Mediated Communication, Educational Strategies", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1018782", "title": "Developing a Framework for Using E-Portfolios as a Research and Assessment Tool", "author": "Shin, Sun-young", "description": "As Tarone (1998) stated, an understanding of interlanguage variation in relation to contextual changes has been a key issue in both second language acquisition (SLA) and language assessment (LA) research. Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

This implies that the automatization of word decoding to free the working memory is indispensable. Therefore, developing a multimedia application for vocabulary learning with a time-control function, our study hypothesizes that vocabulary learning with this function brings about the automatization of word decoding or faster recall of the meanings, and, as a result of freeing more working memory, better comprehension of text. According to our research, multimedia application users not only retained more words and recalled their meanings more quickly but also obtained higher scores on reading comprehension tests that contained the words learned through the application.

Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1004382", "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Situated Activity and CALL Learning in Teacher Education", "author": "McNeil, Levi", "description": "Situated learning is often proposed as a model for CALL teacher education. However, we know little about how students perceive situated CALL coursework and activities, and the nature of the relationship between situated learning and CALL learning. This exploratory case study addresses these issues. Survey, questionnaire, and open-ended data were collected from 21 MA TESOL students enrolled in a CALL course in South Korea. The results showed that students perceived that the course offered many elements of situated learning environments, and that some course activities were more situated than others. Additionally, the relationship between situated learning and CALL was strong and positive.

While researchers appreciate the wikis platform for engaging students in virtual team work and authentic language learning, many also have recognized the limitations of using wikis to promote student collaboration (Alyousef &amp; Picard, 2011; Arnold, Ducate &amp; Kost, 2009; Coniam &amp; Kit, 2008; Judd, Kennedy &amp; Cropper, 2010; Warschauer, 2010). The current study aims to examine what factors facilitated or hindered student collaboration when a wiki environment was used to engage 103 Taiwanese students from two universities in an online picture book production project. Divided into 17 groups of four to six members, the students spent approximately one academic year forming online communities, learning to conduct peer editing, and collaboratively completing a final learning product, an online picture book. A variety of data, including the electronically archived versions of the wiki pages, students' responses to retrospective surveys, and focused follow-up interviews were collected and analysed. The findings suggested that the nature of the learning tasks, students' constant communication and appreciation of different opinions, the difficulties they encountered when communicating asynchronously, and students' expectations toward English learning affected to what extent they were involved in the online collaboration.", "subject": "Cooperative Learning, English (Second Language), Picture Books, Web 2.0 Technologies, Editing, Researchers, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Student Developed Materials, College Students, Student Attitudes, Student Surveys, Interviews", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1004384", "title": "Decoding the \"CoDe\": A Framework for Conceptualizing and Designing Help Options in Computer-Based Second Language Listening", "author": "Cardenas-Claros, Monica Stella, Gruba, Paul A.", "description": "This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the conceptualization and design of help options in computer-based second language (L2) listening.

It considers authenticity as the result of a social negotiation process rather than an innate feature of a text, object, person, or activity. From this basis, it argues that authenticity claims play an important role in both second language acquisition (SLA) and CALL, being utilized to support the legitimacy of an approach or discipline more generally, as well as in defending a specific didactic design, especially with regard to transfer and motivation. The paper distinguishes between three domains of authenticity claims essential to CALL contexts: authenticity through language (linguistic authenticity), authenticity through origin (cultural authenticity), and authenticity through daily life experiences (functional authenticity). It points out problematic aspects of engaging in authenticity claims and argues that a reflexive stance might be useful in questioning the role of authenticity claims in CALL theory and practice.", "subject": "Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Motivation", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1004386", "title": "Play to Learn, Learn to Play: Language Learning through Gaming Culture", "author": "Ryu, Dongwan", "description": "Many researchers have investigated learning through playing games. However, after playing games, players often go online to establish and participate in the online community where they enrich their game experiences, discuss game-related issues, and create fan-fictions, screenshots, or scenarios. Although these emerging activities are an essential part of gaming culture, they have not attracted much attention from researchers and only a few empirical studies have been done on learning through beyond-game culture. Language learning in particular has not been extensively researched despite the proliferation of game players who speak English as a foreign language within this community. To address how non-native English speaking (NNE) game players participate in language learning through game play and beyond-game culture, three generations of activity theories and a multiple-case study design were employed in this study. The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture. First, words or phrases used in game play could be learned while playing games. Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games. Third, these two types of engagement in gaming culture were closely related to influencing language learning through repeated practices and collaborative interactions. In conclusion, language learning through gaming is appropriately understood when ecological perspectives are adopted to look at both sides of gaming culture.", "subject": "Discourse Analysis, Video Games, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Internet, Sentences, Researchers, Computer Mediated Communication, Case Studies, Intercultural Communication, Electronic Mail, Interviews", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}]
