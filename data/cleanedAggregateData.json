The &quot;C course&quot; blends face-to-face instruction and independent study in a CALL environment. It aims to enhance learners' autonomous use of CALL in the acquisition of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). In this study, three learning support aids were trialed: the Learner Passport, the e-Language Learning Portfolio and the e-Learner Self-Reflection Diary. The participant- researchers examined the course using data from the trial materials, observation, their own reflexive practice, learner questionnaires, interviews, artifacts and learner self-reflections. Findings indicate that teachers' and learners' consciousness was raised about what is expected of users in the autonomous use of CALL in a classroom environment and in a Self-Access Centre. The study also shows an improvement in learners' planning, organizing, tracking, and evaluation of their autonomous use of CALL resources, and that regular and critical learner self-reflection is a key factor\ncontributing to a positive shift in study culture. It recommends the conversion of the Learner Passport to an online, interactive format and the course-wide implementation of the three learning support aids as an incorporated package.

The research focuses on three iterations of the learner training conducted over a 21-month period, drawing on almost 500 completed student feedback responses. The findings show that students considered the training sessions helpful in establishing how online language classes operate and gaining confidence to participate actively. Specifically they benefited from using their L1 to practice techniques for projecting their social presence in an online communicative situation, compensating for the lack of features such as body language, non-verbal communication, and spatial impressions. As for their teachers, the research demonstrated a need to reflect on the terminology used to explain CMC tools.

This article reports on a two-year study exploring the design and implementation cycle of online activities as an integral part of a distance language course. When the course was introduced in 2009, activities had been designed on the basis of second language acquisition principles as well as sociocultural theories, providing a basis for student interaction and taking into account the affordances of the environment, a Moodle-based VLE. After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners. Consequently, activities were re-designed and a number of changes were implemented in 2010 that included more teacher involvement, fewer tasks, a simpler structure, and a reduced number of tools. A comparison of learner participation across the two years shows that these changes had a positive impact on learner engagement.", "subject": "Learner Engagement, Interaction, Teaching Methods, Technology Uses in Education, Online Courses, Distance Education, Second Language Instruction, Virtual Classrooms, Student Surveys, Interviews, Diaries, Statistical Analysis, Student Attitudes, Educational Technology", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1027980", "title": "&quot;My Major Is English, Believe It or Not:)&quot; -- Participant Orientations in Nonnative/Native Text Chat", "author": "Vandergriff, Ilona", "description": "In their interactions with native speakers (NS), nonnative speakers (NNS) often position themselves as relative novices. For example, they may orient to the language expertise differential by apologizing for their linguistic ineptness or by making self-disparaging remarks about their second language (L2). This is true even for advanced learners in settings which foreground language learning (Hosoda, 2006). By and large, previous research on NNS/NS interaction has narrowly focused on instances where L2 ineptness interferes with mutual understanding. Widening the scope of analysis, this study considers such orientations more broadly, including those where perceived L2 shortcomings did &quot;not&quot; trigger miscommunication. Using extracts from a corpus of dyadic NNS/NS task-based interactions in quasi-synchronous CMC (SCMC), this study seeks to document ways in which advanced NNS participants position themselves and are positioned by NSs. The findings show that, as a group, these orientations to participants&apos; differential language competence do not primarily occur in (other-)repair sequences but rather elsewhere in the interaction. The data suggest that they serve a range of social functions, including (re-)indexing an L2 social self, building and maintaining social solidarity and intersubjectivity with the coparticipant, and ratifying the power of the native speaker (see Kramsch, 1998).", "subject": "Synchronous Communication, Second Language Learning, Native Speakers, Computer Mediated Communication, Communicative Competence (Languages), Interpersonal Communication", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1027985", "title": "The Use of Linking Adverbials in Academic Essays by Non-Native Writers: How Data-Driven Learning Can Help", "author": "Garner, James Robert", "description": "Over the past several decades, the TESOL community has seen an increased interest in the use of data-driven learning (DDL) approaches.

L2 writing research has long highlighted the benefits of collaboration in terms of both L2 learning and text quality. Most recently, the positive effect of co-ownership and peer feedback on process and product has been emphasized in studies on Computer-Supported Collaborative Writing. What has remained underexplored is the impact of web 2.0 technologies on &quot;advanced&quot; L2 writing. The present paper bridges this gap through an empirical study combining Web 2.0 technologies with an academic writing task. Collaborative and individual writing processes and products are compared by applying a mixed-methods approach. The results shed new light on claims made in previous studies that collaboration leads to higher text accuracy. No statistically relevant difference was found between the individual and collaborative syntheses in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency.

A qualitative and quantitative analysis of their replies showed that students prefer not to navigate away from main web pages of modules to read exclusively annotated versions of texts on separate web pages, and that students read both the texts on the main web pages and on the annotated versions when texts are more demanding. Students rely less on an annotated version when a video advance organizer is provided.

In an independent groups design, participants (n=120) took tests reduced in tempo by various amounts. It was found that slower speed input led to increases in performance. The slower the speed of delivery the less likely the participants were to perceive the test as difficult and the less speed became an issue.

Participants completed four comparable interpersonal consensus building tasks over eight weeks: two in the social VR application, vTime XR\u2122, and two in a traditional classroom. Immediately following each task, participants self-assessed their anxiety. Moreover, a subsample of participants' self-reported anxiety data was complemented with a physiological indicator of anxiety, salivary cortisol, to evaluate using this biomarker in FLA research. Participants' speech for all tasks was rated by four native French speakers for comprehensibility. Descriptive statistics are presented. Self-reported anxiety and cortisol data indicated that participants were less anxious in VR and throughout the eight weeks. A positive correlation was found between self-reported and cortisol data, indicating consistency between these two anxiety measures.

First, we analyze student journals to identify problematic areas for British students learning Chinese as a foreign language, which seem to spread across levels of phonology, morphology, orthography, and vocabulary in an inextricable fashion. To address this issue, we designed a hierarchical network model linking levels of sound, syllables, characters, words, and phrases together in the form of nodes and connections. Current implementation of the model is a CALL system nicknamed Linkit, which can work alongside a textbook or a corpus, offering interconnected elements of the Chinese language such as the syllable, the character, the word, and the phrase on the same screen. The purpose of the design is for students to view a Chinese character not just as a character, but to see how it relates to other homophonic characters by appreciating the underlying phonological similarities and how the character can develop into a word or a phrase.

We argue that our attempt to promote interaction through our VLE model has resulted in a contested space where traditional hierarchies and relationships between tutors and learners are in a state of flux and where new hierarchies and relationships are constantly being forged.

The methodology used is a qualitative analysis of interviews with seven tutors of three different blended learning courses. The results show that most tutors indeed had difficulties gaining a deeper insight into the course design: they considered the face-to-face modality to be the central one, just as in a traditional L2 course (whereas course design was centred on the online modality), and therefore rarely played their role as online tutors. Moreover, their understanding of the courses' task-based approach appeared to be limited. Nevertheless, the majority of the tutors managed to feel involved in the course, which shows the importance of additional factors in defining their relationship to the course. We identified eight other factors, which are partly due to the intense use of ICT within the course (as shown by a comparison with two additional interviews with e-learning-tutors), and partly depend specifically on the blended learning mode.

Our study shows that tutors mainly use verbal and chat feedback, with significant inter-individual variability, and that tutors who provide verbal feedback are more likely to use markers. Marking takes time because of the dual task that it entails for the tutor. Idiosyncratic strategies in the use of markers are evidenced. These results clearly show the value of markers for negative feedback, signal the need for their explicitness, and also call for an evolution of the Visu interface so that tutors can better negotiate the task of online tutoring and the pedagogical stance they have to take on in their interactions with the learners.

By making parts of the face transparent, they can show the correct position and shape of the tongue and provide audiovisual feedback on how to change erroneous articulations.

Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality.

Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use.

In relation to Bax's theory about the &quot;normalisation&quot; of CALL, the author defends that, as long as technology continues to evolve and new gadgets appear on the market, there will always be a place for CALL developers and authors to find the optimum way of pedagogically exploiting these forever-emerging technological developments.", "subject": "Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Information Technology, Educational Trends, Futures (of Society), Teaching Methods, Trend Analysis, Computer Software, Spanish, Foreign Countries, English, French, German, Programming, Networks, Educational History", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Spain (Valencia)"}, {"id": "EJ1108848", "title": "Exploring the Affordances of the Writing Portal (TWP) as an Online Supplementary Writing Platform (For the Special Issue of GLoCALL 2013 and 2014 Conference Papers)", "author": "Lee, Kean Wah, Said, Noraini, Tan, Choon Keong", "description": "The writing process has traditionally been seen &quot;as a lonely journey&quot; to typify the lack of support that students experience for writing outside the classroom. This paper examines an attempt of The Writing Portal (TWP), a supplementary online writing platform, to support students' writing needs throughout the five stages of the writing process, viz., planning, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing. Social constructivist principles underpin TWP, which was designed to engender collaboration amongst its student participants. Not only does TWP provide links to evaluated Internet resources and a writing portfolio, but it also features collaboration tools such as the Group Forum, chat, a writing portfolio, a private messaging system, and a comment function for pages or articles created. Thus, it is very much akin to a &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for academic writing within a flexible and supportive environment. In this qualitative case study, 16 third-year TESL pre-service teachers at a Malaysian Teacher Education Institute embarked on a 12-week writing course using TWP. Qualitative data in the form of students' online discourses, task reflections, log files, and digital artefacts were captured to explore how TWP's affordances supported students' writing needs. In addition, Soller's collaborative learning conversation skills (CLCS) taxonomy was used as an analytical framework to investigate the collaborative learning engendered in the online environment. The findings indicate that TWP served its purpose by addressing students' writing needs at all stages of the writing process as they accomplished multiple writing tasks. Additionally, evidence of collaborative learning is evident in three functions of TWP: the Group Forum, chat, and the comments for pages/articles. However, there are differences between the frequencies of the specific skills used for each function. To conclude, TWP appears to be a successful tool at supporting students at all stages of the writing process.", "subject": "Computer Uses in Education, Writing Instruction, Writing Processes, Affordances, Supplementary Education, Cooperative Learning, Case Studies, Qualitative Research, Preservice Teachers, English (Second Language), Student Needs, Foreign Countries, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Malaysia"}, {"id": "EJ1099285", "title": "Perceptions of Webcam Use by Experienced Online Teachers and Learners: A Seeming Disconnect between Research and Practice", "author": "Kozar, Olga", "description": "Videoconferencing tools, like Skype, etc., are being increasingly used in language education worldwide.

This study interviews 20 experienced online language tutors and 20 adult students about their attitudes towards webcams and their use of webcams. The findings suggest that most teachers and students only used webcams at the start of their lessons for socio-affective reasons and discontinued the use of webcams after the first 2-3 weeks. Some common reasons for reducing the use of webcams were the perception of &quot;webcamming&quot; as a more tiring mode, the feeling of self-consciousness and privacy concerns.

This paper reports findings in these two areas. Twenty-six randomly selected, non-English majors participated in a conventional English writing class, forming the control group, while 18 students took part in a blog-integrated English experimental writing class. The results of comparison showed no significant differences between the two classes in regards to metalinguistic strategy use but there were significant differences in &quot;metalinguistic awareness.&quot; It is conjectured that more exposure to the target language materials, the interaction and collaboration among students, the aid of the reverse-chronological order of blogs, and the integration of blogs in the writing class significantly enhanced students' metalinguistic awareness.

To achieve this aim, three instruments, i.e. questionnaires (n = 345), in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 128), and non-participant observations (50 sessions), were employed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The results indicate that Iranian EFL students are generally positive about mobile learning and the use of mobile devices for learning EFL. The perceived benefits of mobile learning comprised opportunities for ubiquitous learning and access to the Internet, use of multimedia in the classroom, and portability. On the contrary, the findings suggest that students might be discouraged from the use of mobile devices due to several perceived impeding factors. The analysis of the data illustrated that Iranian EFL students mainly use mobile devices for non-academic purposes. The majority of students own smartphones and laptops and prefer to use tablet PCs, smartphones, and laptops for language learning. The findings of the observations suggest that even though some Iranian EFL teachers favor the use of mobile devices in the classroom, some of them prevent students from such use.

However, studies framed in terms of concordancing often overlook potentially significant differences in concordancing conditions by treating concordances as a simple, unidimensional construct. This study identifies variables within concordancing that may provide learners with diverging affordances, affordances that are not mutually compatible, and explores concordancing through a survey of concordance users' preferences. The data is analysed through a series of factor analyses which indicate that concordancing is a complex, multidimensional construct. It finds that there are at least four factors underlying the construct of concordancing: how citations are formatted, the type of corpus used, the order citations are presented in, and the task engaged in.

One aspect of this phenomenon namely, use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), has expanded significantly, highlighting the need for a review. This paper analyzes findings from 10 learner-based studies that draw on accounts of SLA informed by cognitive and sociocultural theories. Analysis reveals that research conducted from the sociocultural perspective provides evidence of constructs identified as playing a central role in SLA. Analysis indicates that playing MMORPGs elicits target language dialogue involving collaboration, assistance and co-construction. Data show that MMORPGs provide access to conditions conducive to the operation of zones of proximal development. Findings show that this type of game provides access to both in-game and extramural communities of practice that facilitate language socialization. Research undertaken from a cognitive perspective shows that participation in MMORPG-based gaming facilitates production of the target language. However, this work does not provide conclusive evidence that game play elicits forms of interaction such as negotiation, that are hypothesized as playing a central role in learning in the cognitive account of SLA. Studies conducted from both perspectives draw attention to positive learner attitudes indicating high levels of motivation. The analysis reveals that although studies are subject to limitations, they have produced promising results.

This study examined an animation design course adopting CBI to promote reading abilities of English majors at a technology university in Taiwan. CBI usually adds challenges in cognitive and linguistic learning, especially for English majors in computer courses. Different from other CBI courses, this course dealt with multiple situations: multi-approaches (CBI and task-based instruction); multi-skills (Flash animation software skills--various animation effects; language skills--computer vocabulary and reading comprehension); multi-level learners (various English language proficiency levels--mostly low proficiency level; computer abilities; learning styles), and a large class taught by one instructor. Simply employing CBI cannot solve such complex problems. Therefore, instructional streaming video was applied as a learner-directed scaffold and a technological facilitator. A control group and an experimental group comprised 117 and 121 English majors taking this course for one semester respectively. Both groups were taught with English materials but the later were additionally provided with instructional streaming video (ISV). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from classroom observations, interviews, exams, and semester-end questionnaires from both groups to examine whether ISV facilitated instructor teaching and student learning.

We draw on the conceptual frameworks and discourse analytical tools developed by researchers of online communication practices at the post-secondary level and turn this lens to examine how an international online exchange project might contribute to the creation of an in-school learning environment in which adolescents use technology to interact with distally located peers through telecollaboration. The particular contribution of this study is twofold: to offer insight into patterns that characterize the literacy practices that emerge through the introduction of telecollaboration into the learning environment and to document the types of pedagogical decision-making that such projects introduce into the secondary context. Using a case-study design, we explored two central areas: (1) What patterns of interaction emerge in the literacy practices of adolescent students as they build relationships with their intercultural partners? (2) How do teachers address the pedagogical issues that are foregrounded when introducing innovative literacy practices such as telecollaboration into the secondary learning environment? Our premise is that online exchanges might offer a different kind of learning experience that provides opportunities for adolescents to engage with language in ways that do not typically get enacted in conventional language classrooms. Our interest therefore is grounded both in providing a rich, descriptive inventory of how adolescents engage with telecollaboration in the classroom context, as well as in documenting the types of pedagogical issues that are introduced. We offer a linguistically grounded portrait of what constitutes the interactional patterns and pedagogical issues in a classroom learning environment shaped by the introduction of an online intercultural project.

Despite the pervasiveness of e-book reading studies in higher education, most studies show that students' reactions to e-books are often negative. However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms. The different results may be due to different reading purposes. In addition, limited studies have investigated whether students' perceptions of e-books change over time since many of the e-book reading studies used a survey, rather than longitudinal, approach. Thus, this study intended to determine (1) English as a foreign language (EFL) college students' perceptions of e-books when they read for the purpose of responding to literature rather than for the purpose of intensively studying in an academic context; and (2) whether these perceptions change over time as based on a qualitative perspective. Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books. However, the e-book reading experience was still considered unpleasant to most of the participants in this study. This implies that the reading purpose may not have a great influence on students' perception of e-books. Despite the overall negative perceptions of e-books, the students also demonstrated some improved attitudes toward reading e-books for an entire semester.

Among the various ways of collocation learning, the DDL (data-driven learning) approach encourages the independent learning of collocations and allows learners to directly use corpora and tools to search for proper collocations. There are several useful collocation tools (JustTheWord, COCA, Tango, Gutenberg Collocation Tool) available for English as a second language (ESL) learners. There are, however, very few Chinese collocation tools available for learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL), despite the increasing numbers of CFL learners within the past several years. To help CFL students and teachers efficiently search for proper collocates, this paper introduces a new web-based collocation retrieval tool, ICE (Intelligent Collocation Engine), which is based on a large part-of-speech-tagged Chinese news corpus. To determine if the new tool can facilitate the searching of collocations, this tool was tested by a group of CFL students to find proper collocates in a translation task. The results showed that the students who used the ICE tool could successfully found many proper Chinese collocates for a given noun. In addition, 12 in-service CFL teachers were also invited to evaluate the effectiveness of this collocation tool. These teachers indicated that they could find proper Chinese collocates easily with the help of ICE. The teachers also commented that they might use the collocation retrieval tool to prepare their teaching materials. Both findings of the experiment as well as the survey suggest that the new collocation retrieval tool can facilitate Chinese collocation teaching and learning, but the content and functions of this tool can be further enhanced.

To achieve this aim, CALL employs technological innovations to create novel types of language practice. Evaluations of the new practice types serve the important role of distinguishing effective practice environments from less effective environments, while simultaneously informing educational practices and second language acquisition (SLA) theory. Accordingly, evaluations of CALL systems necessarily deal with multiple criteria. Most researchers would probably agree that motivation is an important criterion in CALL evaluations: a system can provide sufficient L2 input and opportunities for L2 output, yet fail to be pedagogically effective if learners are unwilling to participate. Furthermore, knowledge of the motivational impact of practice can provide valuable context linking individual language learners, practice effort and learning outcomes. From the perspective of recent theoretical developments in L2 motivation theory, this paper surveys a representative sample of CALL system evaluations that include motivational impact. Our analysis suggests not only that CALL needs to do more to align its treatment of motivation with recent L2 motivation theories, but also that it is well positioned to do so. We find that: (1) few CALL studies treat motivation as it relates to practice as a dynamic variable; (2) behavioural practice logs are underexploited; and (3) very few evaluations take into account learners' individual interests and goals.

If discussion posts and editing acts are not considered in tandem, analyses may overlook a number of non-collaborative (e.g. refusing to accept one another's edits and respond to feedback, and claims of ownership over the wiki text) as well as collaborative behaviors (e.g. willingness to accept edits and respond to feedback).", "subject": "Collaborative Writing, Web 2.0 Technologies, High School Students, Foreign Countries, Editing, Coding, Transcripts (Written Records), English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Computer Uses in Education", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": "Kuwait"}, {"id": "EJ1159293", "title": "A Survey of Native Language Teachers&apos; Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in Taiwan", "author": "Cheng, Kun-Hung", "description": "An increasing amount of research has focused on the exploration of English as a Foreign Language teachers' technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK).

A survey was therefore conducted to examine 172 in-service Hakka language teachers' perceptions of TPACK in Taiwan. The survey framework includes seven constructs: content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), technological knowledge (TK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), and TPACK. According to the results, although the native language teachers were satisfied with their TPACK on average, they had relatively low confidence in CK, TK, and TPK. While the older male teachers tended to be more confident in their CK, the older female teachers were inclined to have less confidence in their TK. Teaching experience was positively related to the teachers' perceived CK, PK, and PCK. Particularly, the importance of the teachers' TCK, PK, and TK in their synthesized TPACK was identified.

Almost invariably, these publications account for the observed benefits with reference to Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory,&quot; suggesting it is the visual illustration of word meaning that enhances the quality of processing and hence makes new words more memorable. In this discussion article, we explore the possibility that it is not necessarily the multimodality &quot;per se&quot; that accounts for the reported benefits. Instead, we argue that the provision of multimodal annotations is one of several possible means of inviting more and/or longer attention to the annotations--with amounts of attention given to words being a significant predictor of their retention in memory. After reviewing the available research on the subject and questioning whether invoking Paivio's &quot;Dual Coding Theory&quot; is an optimal account for reported findings, we report an eye-tracking study the results of which are consistent with the alternative thesis that the advantage of multimodal glosses for word learning lies with the greater quantity of attention these glosses attract in comparison with single-mode glosses.

Telecollaboration support included the BigBlueButton video communication platform and Moodle chat. The overall objective was to explore the pedagogical potential of pedagogical lingua franca exchanges via telecollaboration for authentic intercultural communication practice and foreign language competence development beyond the face-to-face classroom. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of oral and written lingua franca conversations and corresponding reflective feedback interviews provided evidence of (a) increased learner agency in connection with communicative participation, topic development, languaging for communicative success and rapport building, and (b) emerging emancipatory qualities of non-native speaker identity including a growing sense of speaker satisfaction and trust in one's own creativity and strategic resourcefulness.

However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students' written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher's feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, and at the same time does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.

To facilitate Chinese writing, non-native learners need to use aspects of the radical knowledge as cues to encode characters, from which the contents of the game were built up for SSAHLC to master the Chinese written forms by playing the CRLG with gesture-based interactions. In addition, the game was used to explore the students' intrinsic motivation relevant to online learning self-efficacy, as well as the experience of flow, to predict the degree of learning progress. Data were collected from 78 SSAHLC participating in the study, and 73 valid questionnaires were returned.

All participants undertook the same web-based intervention task which involved reconstructing spoken text into the written form in a number of stages. In terms of task interaction, lower WRS proficiency participants chose to listen to stimulus material more often and changed their efforts at reconstruction significantly more frequently than participants of higher WRS proficiency levels. In relation to task success, lower WRS proficiency learners were significantly less accurate overall and less immediate in their arrival at peak reconstruction accuracy than higher WRS proficiency participants.

This article attempts to be a relevant contribution as an instance of empirical research, showing the application of Learning Analytics to the Language MOOC (LMOOC) 'How to succeed in the English B1 Level Exam.' The focus or the research was threefold, trying to find out: (1) what types of learning objects students engage with most, (2) what aspects of online interaction relate more strongly to course completion and success, and (3) which are the most prominent student profiles in an LMOOC. Results show that short video-pills are the most powerful learning objects in this type of online courses, the regular submission of automated grading activities is a robust indicator towards course success, and the most prominent student profile in LMOOCs is 'viewers', those who access the learning materials but do not submit tasks or engage in online interaction actively, which would explain why the completion rate in LMOOCs is so low. This novel perspective into students' language learning, which big data has assisted us in, should guide course creators to re-design the LMOOC for the enhancement of the audio-visual content. LMOOC instructors and facilitators should also encourage participants to increase the submission of activities--acknowledging these small achievements through micro-credentialing and badges-, and special attention ought to be paid to the most prominent LMOOC profile, those 'viewers' who should be lured into becoming 'solvers' or, even better, 'all-rounders'.", "subject": "Large Group Instruction, Online Courses, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Second Language Instruction, Interaction, Computer Mediated Communication, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Educational Research, Resource Units, Correlation, Student Characteristics, Video Technology, Student Participation, Age Differences, Multiple Intelligences, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1175408", "title": "Statistically-Driven Visualizations of Student Interactions with a French Online Course Video", "author": "Youngs, Bonnie L., Prakash, Akhil, Nugent, Rebecca", "description": "Logged tracking data for online courses are generally not available to instructors, students, and course designers and developers, and even if these data were available, most content-oriented instructors do not have the skill set to analyze them.

The very few systematic reviews on ICC and second language (L2) or FL learning do not take into account the different modalities through which learners interact and co-construct meaning and intercultural competence. Drawing on ecological linguistics (EL) and semiotics, the present review contributes to the field of applied linguistics by reviewing online intercultural exchanges (OIEs) and ICC development in relation to the modality used for each exchange that is reviewed. Features of the context of each study that was conducted in either a K-12 or a university setting were coded according to a coding scheme and analysed quantitatively using descriptive statistics.

Learners used avatars to interact with peers in communication tasks via voice chat.

Two types of negotiation routine were identified: single-layered trigger-resolution sequence and multi-layered trigger-resolution sequence. Specifically, the interrelationship among task types, negotiation and strategy use was also established in the study: jigsaw task prompted the most instances of negotiation and strategy use, followed by information-gap and decision-making tasks, whereas opinion-exchange task triggered the least. This study suggests that two-way directed tasks with convergent, obligatory, single-outcome conditions will stimulate more cognitive and linguistic processes of negotiation involving interactional modifications -- leading to more complex and lengthy negotiation routine.

We propose to instead link readers and texts through multidimensional vectors characterizing the linguistic complexity of the reading material and that of texts written by the learners as proxy of their proficiency level. We first validate the approach using a leveled reading corpus by showing that vector distances computed on the complexity representations can serve the function of the traditional labels. We then highlight the advantage of the multi-dimensional approach using data from a continuation writing task, showing that it makes it possible to study individual complexity dimensions and to explore different degrees of challenge for different dimensions.

Statistical analyses revealed two main results: first, all the three sub-roles of teachers in f2f learning had significantly higher means than those in online learning; then in f2f learning, cognitive role had the highest means whereas in online learning, managerial role had the highest means. The findings indicate that, in students' eyes, teachers had greater impact in f2f learning than in online learning. Furthermore, cognitive role of teachers was perceived to be the most impactful in f2f learning whereas managerial role of teachers was regarded as the most notable in online learning. Further comparison of particular items of the questionnaire revealed more specific differences of teacher roles between the two learning modes.", "subject": "Blended Learning, Online Courses, Teaching Methods, College Students, Student Attitudes, Teacher Role, College Faculty, Conventional Instruction, Teacher Student Relationship, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Comparative Analysis, Foreign Countries", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2019, "identifiersgeo": "China"}, {"id": "EJ1214031", "title": "Bringing L2 Learners' Learning Preferences in the Mediating Process through Computerized Dynamic Assessment", "author": "Bakhoda, Iman, Shabani, Karim", "description": "Computerized dynamic assessment (C-DA) brings the rationality of assessment-instruction integration behind dynamic assessment (DA) into computerized context through the presentation of electronic mediations (Poehner).

To investigate the benefits and possible limitations of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary retention, many researchers continuously conducted relevant experiments worldwide. Among the current mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning research, short message services (SMS), multimedia message service (MMS), and mobile applications (apps) are the predominant approaches supported by the situated learning theory, cognitive mechanisms of L2 word retention, behaviorism, and social constructivism. Although language educators have been focusing on this topic, the effectiveness of mobile L2 vocaubulary learning still remained inconclusive. Besides, to date, little research synthesis has been conducted to investigate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to systematically synthethisize findings from (quaisi-) experimental studies carried out between 2005 and 2018 to examine whether there is a connection between the use of mobile technologies and L2 word retention. The results of 33 primary eligible studies showed a positive and large effect of mobile-assisted L2 word learning interventions. Additionally, SMS/MMS mode was found to be more beneficial for L2 word retention than mobile application mode; however, it is more prudent to interpret this finding as tentative because the number of target words and intervention time were unequal in the two modes. Moreover, the research settings, treatment durations, and task-afforded autonomy are three variables that tend to significantly moderate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 word retention.

Nevertheless, CAPT software still has its limitation. Very little research has been done on what difficulties students may encounter during practice with the system, such as how to read the feedback provided by the software. Moreover, very few CAPT studies investigated how collaborative learning can be integrated to augment the advantages of the technology. Efforts also have to be made on how to increase the enjoyment of learners using it when their motivation is curtailed by the unchanging feedback the CAPT system provides.

The purpose of this study was thus to examine the attitude, knowledge, use, and challenges of English teachers of young learners to integrate technological tools into language classes. Survey data were collected from 95 young learner English language teachers working in language institutes and schools in Iran. The survey was comprised of four parts, namely technological tools questionnaire, teachers' attitude questionnaire, teachers' challenges questionnaire, and 11 open-ended questions. The results of the study revealed that there was a general positive tendency towards the integration of technology into young learner classes. The results also showed that most teachers did not have sufficient pedagogical and technological knowledge to use technology to teach the English language to young learners. The findings also revealed that a large number of teachers were not provided with training courses on the use of technology in young learners' classes; however, they were willing to participate in technology-based professional development programs. Limited computer facilities, teachers' lack of skills, and lack of support from schools and institutes were found to be the major challenges of using technology in young learners' classes.

Second, it investigates answer changing during the two hearings, which include four rounds of item reading taking place during: pre-listening in hearing 1, while-listening in hearing 1, pre-listening in hearing 2, and while-listening in hearing 2. The listening test was completed by 28 secondary school students in different sessions. Using time series, cross-correlation functions, and multivariate data analyses, we found that listeners tended to quickly skim the test items, distractors, and answers during pre-listening in hearing 1 and pre-listening in hearing 2. By contrast, during while-listening in hearing 1 and while-listening in hearing 2, significantly more attention was paid to the written stems, distractors, and options. The increment in attention to the written stems, distractors, and options was greater for the matching items and interactions between item format and item reading were also detected.

FCHTW increased attention to word form at the expense of word meaning. Videos with either captions (FCNA) or audio (NC) were not helpful for the learning of written words, indicating that presentation of verbal information through two modalities (audio plus text) was superior over single-modality presentation. While caption type had no impact on listening comprehension, concurrent presentations of video, audio, and captions did not overload the learners in the FC condition, suggesting that selective attention might be allocated to different parts of the visual stimuli during the first and second exposure to the videos.

To this end, we hired sixty students who attended lectures in English as a foreign language. The students were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Control group 1, with students who learned lecture content with no support, (2) Control group 2, with students for whom transcriptions in the instructional language (i.e. English as a foreign language) were shown during lectures, and (3) the Experimental group, with students for whom SELT-texts (i.e. translated transcriptions from English into the students' native language) were shown during lectures. We compared the attention, meditation, and perceived cognitive load of the students in the three groups and found that the SELT-texts were the most beneficial for student learning. When the SELT-texts were presented, student attention and meditation levels were the highest compared to those of the students in the other two groups. In addition, students perceived lower cognitive load during lectures in a foreign language with SELT support. Finally, the students were satisfied with their learning experience when SELT-texts were presented.

While the literature is replete with findings supporting the essentiality of motivation in an individual's academic success, demotivation (a.k.a. negative motivation) has been underexplored, even though it has been a widespread phenomenon observed in language learning, particularly in the field of English writing in EFL settings. To keep leaners motivated and engaged, innovative pedagogies have been proposed, among which flipped learning and writing instruction have received extra attention. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of flipped learning and online writing practices on enhancing student motivation and learning outcomes. Nonetheless, research on how the aforementioned instructional practices could be integrated to facilitate English writing among EFL learners still remains scarce, let alone a detailed probe into demotivational factors that might exist in such an innovative instructional design. Therefore, this study examined demotivation factors in EFL writing and the effects of the online flipped writing instruction on EFL writing proficiency. Forty-eight sophomore English-majors in Taiwan were paired with American college peers. Multiple sources of data over a semester included pre- and post-tests on two genres (descriptive/argumentative), 'Demotivation Scale', reflective journals, and interviews. The results revealed that the online flipped writing instruction enhanced the students' writing proficiency (both globally and locally), and that four characteristics of the flipped instruction were observed not to cause demotivation in English writing, including self-interest, classroom atmosphere and teaching material, writing product, and teaching method and content. The participants held positive perceptions about the online flipped writing instruction and such learning experience enhanced cross-cultural observation.

Fifty-two students of French as a foreign language were divided into one control and two experimental groups. The two experimental groups were invited to engage in voluntary language learning through a language platform, Duolingo. One of the two experimental groups was trained for self-regulation and received scaffolding for their MALL. The study reveals five main findings: First, students who were trained in self-regulation and received temporary scaffolding present a significantly higher participation in Duolingo. Second, self-regulation features provided by Duolingo are not frequently used by students and therefore do not substantially contribute to students' own learning micromanagement. Third, there is a correlation between high use of Duolingo and improvement in French writing skills. Fourth, just inviting students to engage in voluntary out-of-class MALL does not result in higher test scores for French listening, reading or writing skills. Fifth, in a MALL context, self-regulation training and temporary scaffolding contribute to higher test scores in French writing.

The software presents learners with ZPD-based mediation via hints and prompts and generates an actual score reporting their independent performance; a mediated score reporting their mediated performance; and a learning potential score (LPS) reporting the gain between the actual and mediated scores. The results revealed a significant difference between learners' actual and mediated scores indicating the inadequacy of non-dynamic testing in accounting for learners' responsiveness to mediation. Moreover, LPS could differentiate among learners classified into the same level by non-dynamic testing. The analysis of each learner's scoring profile plus their LPS proved conducive to diagnosing their strengths and weaknesses in different language constructs included in the test and could help teachers develop fine-tuned individualized learning plans and materials for future learning.", "subject": "Language Tests, Computer Assisted Testing, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Evaluation Methods, College Students, Foreign Countries, Listening Skills, Computer Software, Multiple Choice Tests, Sociocultural Patterns, Scores, Scoring, Language Proficiency, Learning Theories", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2021, "identifiersgeo": "Iran"}, {"id": "EJ1317922", "title": "Exploring the Frontiers of Eye Tracking Research in Language Studies: A Novel Co-Citation Scientometric Review", "author": "Aryadoust, Vahid, Ang, Bee Hoon", "description": "Eye tracking technology has become an increasingly popular methodology in language studies.

We identified a number of countries, researchers, universities, and institutes with large numbers of publications in eye tracking research in language studies. We further discovered a mixed multitude of connected research trends that have shaped the nature and development of eye tracking research. Specifically, a document co-citation analysis revealed a number of major research clusters, their key topics, connections, and bursts (sudden citation surges). For example, the foci of clusters #0 through #5 were found to be perceptual learning, regressive eye movement(s), attributive adjective(s), stereotypical gender, discourse processing, and bilingual adult(s). The content of all the major clusters was closely examined and synthesized in the form of an in-depth review.

To fill this gap, the current study reports on a case study regarding how technology can suit pre-service teachers' preferences as to written feedback provided on online quizzes based on four units in Advanced English Grammar class. The study benefited from both qualitative and quantitative approaches to find answers to the research questions. The convenience sampling method was chosen, and the participants of the study included 64 seniors enrolled in the elective course entitled Advanced English Grammar II at a state-run university in the southwest of Turkey.

However, empirical studies investigating EFL students' reading comprehension performance on mobile phones and students' perceptions of these reading formats are lacking. The present research employed questionnaire surveys and semistructured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading in terms of participants' reading comprehension accuracy, reading speed, and reading strategy used (i.e. general, problem-solving or support strategies) and explore EFL learners' perceptions of mobile-assisted EFL reading. A sample of 81 first-year college students participated in a quasiexperiment, 6 participants participated in a semistructured interview, and a sample of an additional 10 students participated in a pilot study. The analyses, including qualitative descriptions, mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired-sample t-tests, and independent-sample t-tests, indicated that participants achieved superior reading comprehension accuracy when reading from printed paper compared to reading from mobile phones. Superior reading speed from paper was observed only when participants were instructed to read and complete the comprehension test the first time, while no difference in speed between the two reading media was observed the second time. Additionally, participants' use of reading strategies during mobile-assisted EFL reading was not as effective as that during paper reading. Regarding participants' preferences, most participants (79%) preferred reading from paper over mobile phones because hard copies provided a better reading experience and promoted active reading engagement. However, participants held positive attitudes toward mobile-assisted EFL learning and wanted to continue to read from mobile phones to assist their foreign language learning due to their convenient built-in functions and portability.

This increase is partially due to the belief that AWE can assist teachers by allowing them to devote more feedback to higher-level (HL) writing skills, such as content and organization, while the technology addresses lower-level (LL) skills, such as grammar. As is speculated, student revisions will then be positively impacted. However, little evidence has supported these claims, calling into question the impact of AWE on teaching and learning. The current study explored these claims by comparing two second language writing classes that were assigned to either an AWE + teacher feedback condition or a teacher-only-feedback condition. Findings suggest that using AWE as a complement to teacher feedback did not have a significant impact on the amount of HL teacher feedback, but the teacher who did not use AWE tended to provide a greater amount of LL feedback than AWE alone. Furthermore, students seemed to revise the teacher's LL feedback more frequently than LL feedback from the computer. Interestingly, students retained their improvement in accuracy in the long-term when they had access to AWE, but students who did not have access appeared to have lower retention. We explain the relevance of our findings in relation to an argument-based validation framework to align our work with state-of-the-art research in the field and contribute to a broader discussion about how AWE can be best provided to support second language writing development.", "subject": "Automation, Writing Evaluation, Feedback (Response), Revision (Written Composition), Writing Improvement, Second Language Learning, Writing Skills, Teacher Student Relationship, Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Undergraduate Students", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2022, "identifiersgeo": "Iran"}, {"id": "EJ1352575", "title": "Digital Literacy of EFL Students in a Junior High School in Iran: Voices of Teachers, Students and Ministry Directors", "author": "Dashtestani, Reza, Hojatpanah, Shamimeh", "description": "Promoting students' digital literacy has become a significant challenge for educational authorities and course designers.

Relatively few studies, most of them focusing on English idioms, have investigated how L2 idioms are actually acquired and how this process is affected by important idiom properties like transparency (the degree to which the figurative meaning of an idiom can be inferred from its literal analysis) and cross-language overlap (the degree to which L2 idioms correspond to L1 idioms). The present study employed a specially designed CALL system to investigate the effects of intensity of practice and the reading modality on learning Dutch L2 idioms, as well as the impact of idiom transparency and cross-language overlap. The results show that CALL practice with a focus on meaning and form is effective for learning L2 idioms and that the degree of practice needed depends on the properties of the idioms. L2 learners can achieve or even exceed native-like performance. Practicing reading idioms aloud does not lead to significantly higher performance than reading idioms silently. These findings have theoretical implications as they show that differences between native speakers and L2 learners are due to differences in exposure, rather than to different underlying acquisition mechanisms.

Research on assessing TPACK shows that survey items were contextualized to lessen the difficulty of distinguishing between the seven sub-domains of TPACK. However, the difficulty remained perhaps due to a possibility that the seven sub-domains may not appear workable in practice. This issue needs further research. Research on developing TPACK reveals that effective interventions involved language teachers' understanding of the TPACK framework, modeling from teacher educators or experienced teachers, and language teachers' engagement in designing lessons collaboratively.

It is demonstrated how different robot interaction behaviours influence interaction between the robot and the learners and between the two learners. Through an analysis of learner interaction, collaboration and learner ratings for the different robot behaviours, it is observed that the learners were most positive towards the robot behaviour that focused on interviewing one learner at the time (highest average ratings), but that they were the most active in sessions when the robot encouraged learner-learner interaction. Moreover, the preferences and activity differed between learner pairs, depending on, e.g., their proficiency level and how well they knew the peer.

The findings revealed three forms of appropriation (i.e., regular, partial, and rare) among the students, who had used various artifacts (e.g., dictionary) and rules (e.g., teacher requirement), taken on different roles (e.g., student writer, spotlight-avoider), and resorted to different community members (e.g., peers) to mediate their appropriation.

In contrast to the extant gamification literature focusing on designing reward systems and/or facilitating teachers' gamification of learning contents, this study focuses on the gamifying of learning content by students. To verify the efficacy of gamification as a learning activity, the effects of students posing and gamifying questions in relation to second language grammar learning are explored. A gamification platform called &quot;TipOn&quot; was designed to allow students to pose and gamify questions according to different game modes to facilitate their classmates' practicing English grammar. To examine the emotional regulation effects of posing and gamifying questions on learning performance, this study explored the effectiveness of gamifying content by examining how participants' two types of epistemic curiosity (i.e., interest-type epistemic curiosity (IEC) and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity (DEC)) related to posing questions affected their attitude towards gamification (ATG) and their learning progress. In this experiment, participants had to pose English grammar questions related to verb tense, and gamify the questions using TipOn. They then played games using other students' content. Data were collected from 96 ninth-grade students, and the correlations between constructs were evaluated using the path-analytical technique. The research results indicated that, first, English learning anxiety is negatively related to the two aforementioned types of epistemic curiosity. Second, IEC had no significant impact on ATG; however, DEC was positively associated with ATG. Third, ATG could positively predict students' learning progress. The results imply that teachers could use this gamifying system in a flipped classroom to motivate students to tap into their epistemic curiosity to increase their content learning and enhance the effects of learning.", "subject": "Gamification, Grammar, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Personality Traits, Anxiety, Instructional Effectiveness, Emotional Response, Student Attitudes, Grade 9, High School Students, Flipped Classroom, Academic Achievement, Foreign Countries", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2022, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan (Taipei)"}, {"id": "EJ1023641", "title": "Embedding Technology in Translation Teaching: Evaluative Considerations for Courseware Integration", "author": "Barr, David", "description": "This article shall discuss a number of factors to be considered in the process of integrating computer technology into the student language learning experience.

A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html].

Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the results indicated that the majority of the participants have positive attitudes towards CALL and find it relevant to the cultural context of Iran. Teachers have moderate computer competence, while students have limited competence. Language teachers and students have daily access to computers mostly at home. The study further shows the difference between language teachers and students in that although teachers are presumed to be ambivalent about computer-related issues, in comparison with their students, teachers rank significantly higher on the CALL attitude and computer competence scales. From the positive CALL attitudes of both groups, it may be inferred that they will use computers in language education once computers become available, accompanied by adequate training.

Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction. While some may argue that the ICW cannot take the place of face-to-face interactions in a well-designed and executed ESL course, the e-learning environment offers several advantages: it is self-paced, private (thus less threatening), and provides continuous opportunities for practice and reinforcement.", "subject": "Online Courses, Web Based Instruction, Foreign Nationals, Nurses, Communicative Competence (Languages), Intercultural Communication, Workshops, Phonemes, Vowels, Intonation, Electronic Learning, Improvement Programs, Independent Study", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1032527", "title": "Direct and Indirect Access to Corpora: An Exploratory Case Study Comparing Students' Error Correction and Learning Strategy Use in L2 Writing", "author": "Yoon, Hyunsook, Jo, Jung Won", "description": "Studies on students' use of corpora in L2 writing have demonstrated the benefits of corpora not only as a linguistic resource to improve their writing abilities but also as a cognitive tool to develop their learning skills and strategies.

The challenges for training language teachers to deal with this dynamic are considerable.

To break out of this stereotype, &quot;LLT&quot; recruited a top notch editorial board, including leading applied linguistics from around the world. For its inaugural issue in July 1997, the journal invited internationally recognized applied linguistics to submit papers on the topic Language Learning &amp; Technology: Defining the Research Agenda. The resources of the NFLRC and CLEAR were used to achieve broad publicity. &quot;LLT&quot; quickly gathered broad attention. With questions of funding, peer review, and other matters still under debate, the future of academic journal publishing is very much in flux. When the history of the transition from print to online publishing is written, the important role of &quot;LLT&quot; should be noted as one of the first journals to demonstrate that publishing exclusively on the Internet was fully compatible with being among the best academic journals in the world.", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Educational Technology, Electronic Journals, Access to Information, Research, Periodicals, Electronic Publishing, Internet, Scholarship, Standards, Publishing Industry", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1103545", "title": "Perception-Production Link in L2 Japanese Vowel Duration: Training with Technology", "author": "Okuno, Tomoko, Hardison, Debra M.", "description": "This study examined factors affecting perception training of vowel duration in L2 Japanese with transfer to production. In a pre-test, training, post-test design, 48 L1 English speakers were assigned to one of three groups: auditory-visual (AV) training using waveform displays, auditory-only (A-only), or no training. Within-group variables were vowel, preceding consonant, pitch pattern, and training talker's voice. Perception pre- and post-tests measured identification accuracy and response time (RT). Training involved eight sessions with feedback, including waveforms for the AV group. Results indicated significant improvement for the AV and A-only groups with generalization to novel stimuli and a new voice as well as transfer to production; the AV group showed a greater rate of improvement. Participants found waveform displays very helpful. Vowel type, preceding consonant, and pitch pattern significantly affected perception in testing and training as did the training talker's voice. The easiest pitch pattern was Low-High in the first syllable, perhaps reflecting English prosodic preference, and High--High in the second, which may be more salient. Perception was facilitated by talkers demonstrating greater pitch movement. Accuracy and RTs increased after training; participants reported spending more time evaluating post-training input.

As we progress into the 21st century, I suggest that technology in SLA research will assume an increasingly greater role, approaching Bax's (2003, 2011) notion of &quot;normalization&quot; for the field of computer-assisted language learning, namely that technology is gradually being fully integrated into second language teaching, learning, and research. In addition, I propose that SLA research investigate not only the traditional aspects of linguistic and communicative competence but newer types of &quot;symbolic competence&quot; (e.g., Kramsch, 2011) and &quot;intercultural communicative competence&quot; (e.g., Byram, 1997), which include integral technological components, and which are a part of general &quot;digital literacies&quot; or &quot;multiliteracies.&quot;", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Language Research, Influence of Technology, Computer Assisted Instruction, Communicative Competence (Languages), Multiple Literacies, Second Language Instruction, Technology Integration, Teaching Methods, Meta Analysis", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1103554", "title": "Technology and the Four Skills", "author": "Blake, Robert", "description": "Most L2 instructors implement their curriculum with an eye to improving the four skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing.

It is therefore no surprise that CALL researchers, as in other areas of applied linguistics, have turned in recent years to meta-analysis as a means to synthesize quantitative results across studies. To date, nearly 30 CALL-SLA syntheses and meta-analyses have been conducted, covering topics from hypertext glosses (Yun, 2011) to synchronous computer-mediated communication (Ziegler, 2015) to game-based learning (Chiu, Kao, &amp; Reynolds, 2012). Despite these individual contributions, the overall effects of CALL on SLA across domains have yet to be addressed. In this &quot;second-order&quot; review, we provide a thorough account of substantive findings and a critical description and evaluation of methodological practices of CALL-SLA meta-analyses. We begin by describing the generally substantial effects of CALL on L2 learning along with an examination of different types of technology such as CALL glosses and computer-mediated communication (CMC).

One of the best-known and frequently replicated features of Cultura is the introduction of intercultural, on-line questionnaires. However, the authors feel that limiting the use of Cultura to those questionnaires is not only reductionist but it can also be counterproductive because, when used alone, the questionnaires accentuate a simplistic, binary approach to culture. Understanding another culture requires that students explore a large variety of other materials and articulate a multiplicity of viewpoints, undertaking the analysis of even the most contradictory ones.

In addition to more travel options and greater technology availability, study abroad has changed in other significant ways. In the US, more students are going abroad for short-term programs (less than 8 weeks), and the participants represent more diverse academic fields, with an increasing number of students from the sciences, social sciences, and business-related fields. The image of the North American student going abroad primarily for language learning, spending a semester or more, no longer fits reality. In fact, many students now engage in service learning, internships, or volunteer work while abroad. Nevertheless, study abroad remains an expected experience for students with a serious interest in language learning.

A common denominator in current views and practices concerning vocabulary learning is the recognition of the centrality of context, whether that be in independent reading, watching, or listening in the L2; interacting with other L2 users online (social media, gaming, fanfiction, etc.); accessing sample expression use through corpora; using L2 material supplied with glosses or other comprehension and learning assistance; or encountering and learning new words through everyday conversations in the target language.

Anxiety also decreases chances for fluency development, as learners are less willing to produce output (Gregersen &amp; MacIntyre, 2014), consequently hindering language development (Swain, 2000). One way of minimizing the impact of these limitations is to motivate students to speak intelligibly and fluently, preferably beyond the constraints of the language classroom. In this study, we investigated the pedagogical use of Spaceteam ESL, a mobile game that requires intelligible and fluent computer-mediated oral exchanges among players. Participants (N = 20) were low-intermediate English as a second language (ESL) students divided into two groups: the treatment group, which played Spaceteam ESL as a 15-minute warm-up activity for six weeks, and the control group, which engaged in comparable non-gaming activities. Pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests measured changes in oral fluency (i.e., syllables produced per minute and judges' ratings) and interviews addressed factors related to anxiety and willingness to communicate (WTC).

Rare research has provided evidence of the negotiation produced by NESTs versus NNESTs with EFL learners online and its impact on the learners' output.

To bridge this gap, this study sought to explore the effect of RALL on pragmatic features, including request and thanking speech acts by young Persian-speaking EFL learners. For this aim, 38 preschool children (3 to 6 year-old boys and girls) with no English learning experience were randomly assigned to the RALL (19 students) and non-RALL (19 students) groups. In the RALL group, a humanoid robot was used as an assistant to the teacher to play games, repeat the sentences, and interact with the students. In the non-RALL group the lessons included games similar to those in the RALL group, but without the presence of the robot. There were eight one-hour teaching sessions over a period of four weeks for both groups. Following completion of the lessons in both groups, the results of post-tests were analyzed using an independent sample t-test. The findings revealed a significant difference between the RALL and non-RALL groups' pragmatic performance for thanking and requesting.

After each vlog, the participants took a multiple-choice test measuring their comprehension of details. Afterwards, participants completed a questionnaire about their perception of captions. The findings suggest that the availability of captions may not necessarily lead to better listening comprehension because students, particularly lower proficiency learners, were unable to simultaneously process the multiple modalities (images, audio, and captions) due to their limited capacities of working memory and cognitive load. High-proficiency learners achieved better comprehension than low-and mid-proficiency learners and achieved their best comprehension with L2 captions. A significant increase in comprehension of vlogs caused by high pictorial support was detected, with the inverse relationship also being true. Analysis of the questionnaire indicated that participants consider L2 captions useful. For both L2 and L1 captions, students think that their listening comprehension would decrease without captions.

As we hypothesised, more errors were found in the synchronous mode of communication than in the asynchronous; however, when examining the exact types of errors, some categories were more frequent in the synchronous mode (the formal and grammatical errors, among others), while in the asynchronous, errors of style and lexis occurred more frequently. A analysis of the data revealed that the frequency of error types varied with each different L1 group participating in the simulation, this same analysis also showed that highly relevant associations could be established the participants' L1 and specific error types.", "subject": "Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Interlanguage, Computational Linguistics, Multilingualism, Grammar, Error Patterns, Computer Mediated Communication, Computer Simulation, Native Language, Language Styles, English (Second Language), Writing (Composition), Classification, Error Analysis (Language), Foreign Countries, Comparative Analysis, Asynchronous Communication, Synchronous Communication", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "France, Germany, Latvia, Norway, Spain"}, {"id": "EJ1031151", "title": "Motivation Matters in Mobile Language Learning: A Brief Commentary", "author": "Ushioda, Ema", "description": "As highlighted in the original call for papers for this special issue, learning with mobile technologies is currently a rapidly developing area of interest for researchers, teachers, materials writers and app developers in the educational field, not least within language education. Yet to what extent is this growing interest realised and shared by language learners themselves? How far are they motivated to exploit the affordances offered by mobile technologies for language learning, and how far can mobile technologies help to engage and sustain individual motivation for language learning? Although learner motivation is not a core concern of the studies in this special issue, a particular strength of these papers is their common focus on the student perspective in relation to mobile language learning. This student perspective sheds interesting critical light on the motivational dimension of mobile language learning, which is the thread this author addresses in this commentary article, building on her longstanding interest in motivation in language learning and more recently in relation to the use of digital technologies in language learning (see Ushioda, 2011). Drawing on the empirical findings reported in this special issue, she focuses this short commentary on the following motivational issues concerning mobile language learning: (1) Motivation as a matter of choice and autonomy; and (2) Motivation as a matter of personally meaningful casual learning.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Student Interests, Electronic Learning, Educational Technology", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1031160", "title": "Mobile-Assisted Language Learning: A Selected Annotated Bibliography of Implementation Studies 1994-2012", "author": "Burston, Jack", "description": "Over the past 20 years, project implementation descriptions have accounted for the majority of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) publications, some 345 in total.

After each clip, all participants took a listening comprehension test, which consisted of global and detailed questions. To answer the detailed questions, participants had access to an audio passage of the corresponding clip. At the end of the experiment, participants completed a questionnaire and open-ended survey questions about their perception of captions. Our findings revealed that the full captioning group outperformed both the no captioning and the keyword captioning group on the global comprehension questions. However, no difference was found between the keyword captioning and the no captioning group. Results of the detailed comprehension questions (with audio) revealed no differences between the three conditions.

Seventy-eight students with Chinese as their first language read two online passages with either Chinese (L1) or English (L2) glosses.

In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation.

This meta-analysis also found that the effect of CMC on oral proficiency depends on several methodological factors such as task type, outcome measurement, treatment length, and assessment task. Major findings of the current meta-analysis include: (1) studies relying on elicited data are superior to those utilizing naturalistic data; (2) reading aloud seems to be the task that could elicit the best oral performance from students; (3) surprisingly, CMC appeared to be harmful for accuracy and fluency; (4) studies that employed decision-making generated the largest effect size, followed by studies that used more than one task type; (5) among the four tasks, jigsaw actually generated a negative effect on oral performance; and (6) as the most popular task employed by primary researchers, opinion-exchange studies produced the smallest effect size. These findings need to be interpreted as exploratory rather than confirmatory since each of them became less trustworthy after taking into consideration numerous other factors such as CMC task and the particular CMC tool used, etc. Future research suggestions are provided and the limitations of this meta-analysis are addressed.", "subject": "Computer Mediated Communication, Second Language Learning, Oral Language, Language Proficiency, Intervention, Meta Analysis, Quasiexperimental Design, Effect Size, Literature Reviews, Achievement Gains, Data, Reading Aloud to Others, Accuracy, Reading Fluency, Decision Making, Task Analysis, Competence, Statistical Analysis", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1074893", "title": "Computer-Mediated Input, Output and Feedback in the Development of L2 Word Recognition from Speech", "author": "Matthews, Joshua, Cheng, Junyu, O'Toole, John Mitchell", "description": "This paper reports on the impact of computer-mediated input, output and feedback on the development of second language (L2) word recognition from speech (WRS).

These constructions were new to third-semester students, whereas fourth-semester students had been exposed to them in the previous semester. The results show that, whereas the DDL method and the traditional method were both effective and resulted in lexical and grammatical gains, DDL was more effective for teaching new collocations.

This study examines the meaning-making potential of the webcam in pedagogical interactions from a semiotic perspective by exploring how trainee teachers use the affordances of the webcam to produce non-verbal cues that may be useful for mutual comprehension. The research context is a telecollaborative project where trainee teachers of French as a foreign language (FFL) met for online sessions in French with undergraduate Business students at an Irish university. Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, screen shot data, and students' post-course interviews, it was found, firstly, that while a head and shoulders framing shot was favoured by the trainee teachers, there does not appear to be an optimal framing choice for desktop videoconferencing among the three framing types identified. Secondly, there was a loss between the number of gestures performed by the trainee teachers and those that were visible for the students. Thirdly, when trainee teachers were able to coordinate the audio and kinesic modalities, communicative gestures that were framed, and held long enough to be perceived by the learners, were more likely to be valuable for mutual comprehension.

This study examined two types of tasks: a conceptual task, which tested students' competence to draw a generalizable conclusion through a meaning-making process of corpus consultation; and a procedural task, which asked students to complete problem-solving activities strategically through corpus analysis. Two groups of three students were given the same tasks of corpus consultation but asked to complete the tasks either collaboratively or individually. The students' verbal and nonverbal behaviors during the task completion, pre-and post-interviews, and the instructor's observation notes were the main sources of data for analysis. The results of this study showed that collaboration has significantly different effects depending on the task types of corpus consultation. The collaborative group (CG) outperformed the individual group (IG) in the conceptual corpus consultation task, but the procedural task was more efficiently completed by the IG than the CG. The underperformance of the CG in the procedural task seemed to be partly attributable to the role of established intersubjectivity and the power inequality in the CG.

Unlike conventional full captioning, which provides the full text and allows comprehension of the material merely by reading, PSC promotes listening to the speech by presenting a selected subset of words, where each word is synched to its corresponding speech signal. In this method, word-level synchronization is realized by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, dedicated to the desired corpora. This feature allows the learners to become familiar with the correspondences between words and their utterances. Partialization is done by automatically selecting words or phrases likely to hinder listening comprehension. In this work we presume that the incidence of infrequent or specific words and fast delivery of speech are major barriers to listening comprehension. The word selection criteria are thus based on three factors: speech rate, word frequency and specificity. The thresholds for these features are adjusted to the proficiency level of the learners. The selected words are presented to aid listening comprehension while the remaining words are masked in order to keep learners listening to the audio. PSC was evaluated against no-captioning and full-captioning conditions using TED videos.

If attainment is understood as learner engagement in synchronous, collaborative, spoken interaction which is thought to lead to gains in second language acquisition (SLA), then design considerations that harness learners' agency towards that end is important. This study explores the relationship between learner agency and two different task types, namely an information-gap task and an opinion-sharing task in two peer-to-peer synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) spoken interaction events. Students' choices and how students act on these choices during tasks are analysed using a discourse analysis approach. Audio recordings of four dyads as cases were examined using three analytical dimensions: language functions of verbal interaction, cognitive processing and social processing. The results show that most learners used their agency to reconfigure the tasks from spontaneous to planned interaction, with some choices and actions relating to technology impacting detrimentally on interaction time in the target language. The different tasks were found to filter and channel different types of agency that learners could exercise, namely representational, organisational, and strategic agency as speech acts, and directional agency as a physical act. These types consisted of different natures and purposes and are presented as a framework.

Even a series of studies conducted by one researcher (Dziemianko, 2010, 2011, 2012b) leads to contradictory conclusions, possibly because of the use of paper and electronic versions of existing dictionaries, and the resulting problem with isolating dictionary form as a factor.

In the present study, the researcher examines the potential use of verbal report data produced by test takers interacting in a virtual testing environment. The research seeks to answer two specific questions: (a) What types of strategies are used in the virtual aviation English task performance? and (b) How can the assessed strategies be interpreted in relation to test takers' performance? The analysis of the test takers' verbal reports from stimulated recalls indicates that various cognitive, metacognitive, and communication strategies were used while performing the Virtual Interactive Tasks for Aviation English Assessment, and that there is a positive relationship between the total number of cognitive and metacognitive strategies adopted and the test scores. The findings suggest that the use of an immersive interface and simulated tasks in a virtual world could provide language learners with more authentic opportunities to perform the target tasks and promote strategic, as well as linguistic, competence.", "subject": "English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Recall (Psychology), Language Proficiency, Air Transportation, Employees, Traffic Safety, Language Tests, Test Validity, Computer Assisted Testing, Verbal Communication, Computer Simulation, Metacognition, Scores, Correlation, Task Analysis, Communication Strategies, Cognitive Processes, Alternative Assessment", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1177728", "title": "Virtual World Anonymity and Foreign Language Oral Interaction", "author": "Melchor-Couto, Sabela", "description": "In recent years, a considerably high number of research studies have looked into the use of virtual worlds (VWs) for language learning.

However, how learners undertake such negotiation work and what kind of an impact it has on interactional development in an L2 are still largely unknown mainly due to a lack of focus on task engagement processes. A conversation analytic investigation into negotiation of meaning (NoM) in task-oriented interactions can bring evidence to such development, as conversation analysis (CA), given its analytic tools, allows us to see how participant orientations in interaction evolve over time. Based on an examination of screen-recorded multiparty online task-oriented interactions, this study aimed to describe how users (n=8) of an L2 (1) negotiate and co-construct language and task rules and (2) later show orientations to these rules both in the short term (50 minutes) and in the long term (8 weeks). The findings showed that in addition to negotiating existing rules, the learners co-constructed new rules around an action called policing, which occurred when the learners attended to the breach of language and task rules. Furthermore, even after the negotiation work was completed, they oriented to negotiated rules through policing their own utterances (i.e. self-policing). Overall, this interactional continuum (from other-repairs to self-repairs) brought longitudinal evidence to bear on the role of NoM in the development of L2 interactional competence.

Overcoming the weaknesses commonly associated with traditional narrative review and vote counting, meta-analysis is a statistical method of systematically aggregating and analyzing empirical studies by following well-established procedures. The findings of a meta-analysis, when appropriately conducted, are able to inform important policy decisions and provide practical pedagogical suggestions. With the growing number of publications employing meta-analysis across a wide variety of disciplines, it has received criticism due to its inconsistent findings derived from multiple meta-analyses in the same research domain. These inconsistencies have arisen partly due to the alternatives available to meta-analysts in each major meta-analytic procedure. Researchers have therefore recommended transparent reporting on the decision-making for every essential judgment call so that the results across multiple meta-analyses become replicable, consistent, and interpretable. This research explored the degree to which meta-analyses in the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) discipline transparently reported their decisions in every critical step. To achieve this aim, we retrieved 15 eligible meta-analyses in CALL published between 2003 and 2015. Features of these meta-analyses were extracted based on a codebook modified from Cooper (2003) and Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou and Kern (2012).

This mixed-methods study reports on the tracking of students' corpus use via a purpose-built corpus query and data visualisation platform integrated into a large postgraduate disciplinary thesis writing program at a university in Hong Kong.

The results show significant interdisciplinary and inter-/intra-user trends and variation in the use of particular corpus functions and query syntax adopted by corpus users. Students varied in the type of knowledge (e.g. domain-specific, language-specific) they were accessing, and frequently went beyond the exemplars of the DDL course materials to generate unique queries under their own initiative.

Failure to present an effective authorial stance often results in poor evaluation, which compromises a writer's research potential. This study proposes a \"textlinguistic\" approach to advanced academic writing to complement a typical corpus approach that is oriented toward exploring lexico-grammatical patterns at the sentence level. A web-based stance corpus was developed which allowed the users to study both the linguistic realizations of stance at clause/sentence level and how stance meanings are made at the rhetorical move level. The assumptions the study tested included: (1) whether a textlinguistic approach assists L2 writers to polish their research argument particularly as a result of improved stance deployment, and (2) whether the web-based corpus tool affords a constructivist environment which prompts the learners to infer linguistic patterns to attain deeper understanding. Seven L2 doctoral students in the social sciences were recruited. The results indicate a positive relationship between writing performance and more accurate use of stance. However, the application of higher order cognitive skills (e.g., inferring and verifying) was infrequent in the corpus environment. Instead, the writers used more lower-level cognitive skills (e.g., making sense and exploring) to learn. The participants accessed the integrated \"context examples\" most frequently to guide their learning, followed by rhetorical \"move examples\" and clause-based \"stance examples\". This suggests that the learning of stance is critically contingent on the surrounding contexts.

Eighty-three learners of English as a foreign language participated in a mixed-method experimental study that aimed to first explore the perceived usefulness of, and preferences for, explicit and implicit CF in an immersive educational game, and to secondly chart the relation between learners' perceptions of CF as they pertain to three individual difference factors related to learners' self-perception, namely intrinsic goal orientation, perceived competence and game experience. Survey and interview data showed that CF was found to be generally useful. A regression model indicated that the three measures of self-perception affected learners' perceptions of explicit CF positively, and that there was no impact on perceptions of implicit CF. Further, learners reported having enjoyed the implicit CF, although they did not find it particularly useful for learning.

This empirical study seeks to answer the following question: What is the nature of the linguistic ecology that &quot;WoW&quot; players are exposed to? Many studies have described the developmental opportunities presented by commercially available gaming environments (e.g., Gee, 2003, 2007), their value as sites of literacy development (e.g., Squire, 2008a; Steinkuehler, 2008), and their potential as venues for second language (L2) use and learning (e.g., Peterson, 2010; Thorne, Black, &amp; Sykes, 2009; Thorne &amp; Fischer, 2012; Zheng, Young, Wagner &amp; Brewer, 2009).

Claims have been made that certain games, in particular massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) provide L2 English learners with a linguistically rich and cognitively challenging virtual environment that may be conducive to L2 learning, as learners get ample opportunities for L2 input and scaffolded interaction in the L2. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that L2 English proficiency correlates with the frequency of gaming and types of games played. We base our observation on a study among young L2 English learners (N = 86, aged 11-12, Sweden). Data were collected through a questionnaire, a language diary, and three proficiency tests. The questionnaire provided demographic background information but was also targeted at measuring extramural English habits, i.e., learners' out-of-school contact with English (cf. Sundqvist, 2009). The diary measured how much time the learners spent on seven predetermined extramural English activities during one week, while the tests measured their achieved L2 proficiency regarding reading and listening comprehension, and vocabulary. Previous research among learners aged 15-16 (Sundqvist, 2009) showed positive correlations between playing digital games and L2 proficiency, in particular with regard to vocabulary, and also identified gender-related differences regarding vocabulary (boys outperformed girls) as well as the frequency of gaming and types of games played. These results were corroborated in the present study. A clear pattern emerged from our data: frequent gamers (greater than or equal to 5 hours/week) outperformed moderate gamers who, in turn, outperformed non-gamers.

Also, only eight articles could be identified that use any of these eight keywords in their title. Trends across those papers are identified. In a discussion of existing CALL products and projects that incorporate more than one language, it is argued that while commercial products often include more than one language, this is frequently in a behaviorist or grammar-translation tradition, while innovative plurilingual products and projects tend to be non-commercial and often EU/EC-funded initiatives.

The study uses standardised type-token ratio (sTTR) to analyse concordances extracted from corpora at three different levels of homogeneity/heterogeneity.

First, the levels assume a standard order of language acquisition and cannot be personalized to the users' learning patterns. Second, recommendation decisions are not transparent because the leveling algorithms can be difficult for users to interpret. We propose a novel method for text recommendation that addresses these two issues. To enhance personalization, an open, editable learner model estimates user knowledge of each word in the foreign language. The documents are ranked by new-word density (NWD) -- that is, the percentage of words that are new to the user in the document. The system then recommends documents according to a user-specified target NWD. This design offers complete transparency as users can scrutinize recommendations by reviewing the NWD estimation of the learner model.

Two Chinese language classes (i.e. one at the elementary level and one at the intermediate level) at a small liberal arts college in the United States and a group of Chinese-speaking English majors at a Chinese university in Shanghai participated in the exchange. Analyses of four sources of qualitative data (i.e. WeChat group cultural discussion transcripts, Skype conversations, reflection journals, and end-of-program interviews) gave rise to four benefits of the exchange: promotion of cultural learning, improvement of Chinese language skills, enhancement of learning motivation, and establishment of a language learning community. Quantitative analyses of the end-of-semester questionnaire items show that the benefit regarding cultural learning, on average, received the highest rating, followed by community building and motivation enhancement, with improvement of Chinese skills being rated the lowest. Moreover, intermediate-level students evaluated all four benefits with higher ratings than elementary-level students.

Despite the urgency of the issue, studies on MT output quality in foreign language education remain scarce. Moreover, as MT is advancing every year, updated studies are imperative. Therefore, the present study investigated the quality of MT outputs (Google Translate) from Korean to English by comparing it with the English-translated texts of intermediate English as a foreign language students.

Five trained evaluators examined multiple aspects of MT output samples (N = 104) and students' English texts (N = 104), including mechanics, vocabulary, grammar, and context. The results showed that both texts were equally comprehensible, but MT outperformed the students in most aspects under investigation.

In-service teachers' use also improved after training and, due to the yielded positive correlation, their perceptions were a significant predictor of use.

Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011. The data reported in two studies, one by Conole (2008) and one by Peters, Weinberg and Sarma (2008) are used as points of reference for the comparison with the present study. The findings of the current study point to the autonomy and independence of the language learners in this cohort and the re-emergence of CALL tools, both for in-class and out-of-class learning activities. According to this data set, learners appear to have become more autonomous and independent and much more able to shape and resource their personal language learning experience in a blended learning setting. The students also demonstrate a measure of sophistication in their use of online tools, such that they are able to work around known limitations and constraints. In other words, the students have a keen awareness of the affordances of the technologies they are using.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Foreign Countries, Surveys, Educational Technology, Information Technology, College Students, Comparative Analysis, Computer Assisted Instruction, Learning Activities, Blended Learning, Educational History, Educational Research, Telecommunications, Student Attitudes", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Australia"}, {"id": "EJ1018764", "title": "Online Reading Strategies at Work: What Teachers Think and What Students Do", "author": "Huang, Hsin-Chou", "description": "This study designed and developed a web-based reading strategy training program and investigated students' use of its features and EFL teachers' and students' perceptions of the program. The recent proliferation of online reading materials has made information easily available to L2 readers; however, L2 readers' ability to deal with them requires the development of specific reading strategies. The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy. The program offers four types of reading strategy functions (Global, Problem-solving, Support, and Socio-affective) through 15 strategy buttons: Keyword, Preview, Prediction, Outline, Summary, Semantic Mapping, Pronunciation, Speed Reading, Dictionary, Translation, Grammar, Highlight, Notebook, Music Box, and My Questions. Forty college teachers and thirty-two EFL students in Taiwan were invited to use and evaluate this program. The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies. This connection suggests that teachers should provide more explicit training to encourage all students to use Global strategies for overall textual understanding.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Language Teachers, Second Language Learning, Teacher Attitudes, Student Attitudes, Reading Strategies, Web Based Instruction, Reading Instruction, Educational Technology, Computer Uses in Education, College Faculty, College Students, Program Effectiveness, Reading Comprehension, Teaching Methods, Student Motivation, Holistic Approach, Reading Skills, Problem Solving, Social Influences, Computer Mediated Communication, Educational Strategies", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1018782", "title": "Developing a Framework for Using E-Portfolios as a Research and Assessment Tool", "author": "Shin, Sun-young", "description": "As Tarone (1998) stated, an understanding of interlanguage variation in relation to contextual changes has been a key issue in both second language acquisition (SLA) and language assessment (LA) research. Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

This implies that the automatization of word decoding to free the working memory is indispensable. Therefore, developing a multimedia application for vocabulary learning with a time-control function, our study hypothesizes that vocabulary learning with this function brings about the automatization of word decoding or faster recall of the meanings, and, as a result of freeing more working memory, better comprehension of text. According to our research, multimedia application users not only retained more words and recalled their meanings more quickly but also obtained higher scores on reading comprehension tests that contained the words learned through the application.

Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "EJ1004382", "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Situated Activity and CALL Learning in Teacher Education", "author": "McNeil, Levi", "description": "Situated learning is often proposed as a model for CALL teacher education.

This mixed-method research employed multi-source data to explore and explain the effects of two different ways of sequencing video-based formative assessment on English language learners\u2019 public speaking anxiety and their performance. Two intact classes in a 16-week English public speaking course were randomly assigned to two groups, 25 in the self-assessment-initiated (SAI) group and 26 in the peer-assessment-initiated (PAI) group. Following two different sequences of formative practice, both groups were required to complete three formal English public speeches. Both quantitative and qualitative findings indicated that learners in the SAI group showed significantly lower public speaking anxiety than those in the PAI group, whereas learners in the PAI group showed significantly better public speaking performance. Moreover, the findings showed that SAI formative practice helped the learners to pay more attention to their delivery and anxiety levels in public speaking, while PAI formative practice may have led the learners to improve their proper use of English language.

Both groups (n\u2009=\u2009122) were trained in the use of their respective peer review, OLPR or FTFPR. Both groups wrote two argumentative synthesis essays, immediate and delayed, in two drafts. The second draft of each essay was written after receiving the respective peer review, OLPR or FTFPR. Two Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) tests and a qualitative analysis of peer reviews were conducted to address the study question. Quantitative findings showed that participants in the OLPR group significantly outperformed their FTFPR counterparts in improving the argumentative synthesis writing of EFL university learners. The qualitative analysis of the peer review forms, and the revised essays revealed that the OLPR group gave more systematic feedback than that of FTFPR, OLPR focused on content, organization and language while commenting on the writing strengths and weaknesses. Thus, instructors are advised to use OLPR in argumentative writing classes.

The first area focuses on learning outcomes and builds on the use of conventional measures of learner achievement and instructional efficacy to help guide systematic decisions about innovations in curriculum and assessment. At stake from an outcome orientation is how technology might amplify the pace, reach, and efficacy of using technology to move students toward established curricular goals. The second area views new technologies as the site of learning opportunities, and researchers in this vein ask how to rethink which goals are targeted, which assessments are retooled, and which new areas of learning are forged with digital tools. The affordances of new technologies are viewed as products of a steady stream of innovation that offers novel learning environments, expanded semiotic resources, and new modes of communication.

Learners' pragmatic choices ranged from the selection of the topic of their narratives according to types of social bonds, to the use of specific semiotic resources to build identities in conflict episodes of their stories (i.e., positive identities for themselves and positive and negative identities for their relational partners). The construction of these identities paralleled relational parties' convergent and divergent moves towards connection and autonomy, revealing their relational work. Learners used different semiotic resources in resolution episodes, which enabled them to craft positive identities for themselves as experts, teachers, and learners as well as position their relational partner as a competent agent and shape the connection-autonomy dialectic as \"superiority-equality\".", "subject": "identity, L2 pragmatics, Relational Dialectics Theory, relational work, digital stories", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2020, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "KJ070", "title": "Testing the Waters: Developing Interlanguage Pragmatics through Exploration, Experimentation, and Participation in Online Communities", "author": "Ellen Yeh, Nicholas Swinehart", "description": "This study presents an innovative approach to developing interlanguage pragmatics (ILP) by training students to engage in online participatory cultures and analyzing their participation through the lens of communities of practice.

The findings of this large-scale survey of 2,061 students studying nineteen different TLs indicate four factors comprising learners\u2019 belief systems toward CALL in this context: efficacy of technology for language learning and its connection to motivation, satisfaction with technology used in the learners\u2019 classes, specific benefits of technology, and the importance of computer skills and technical support. Learners\u2019 CALL beliefs were more positive when they had had more exposure to technology in their classes, but this varied based on the TL.

One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward & Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data. The findings revealed valuable insights through the eyes of the learners regarding what technology the learners found to be helpful and/or obstructive, both in the course as well as for their personal use, and suggestions for improvements in use of technology are given.

Secondly, Ballance seems to be stating that since problems that existed at that time were going to be solved by smart phones anyway, many of the findings were already obsolete at the time of publication. Not only does this seem to place an exaggerated expectation on the effects that smart phones may have, but it also fails to consider the ways in which learners engaged in the activities and their views towards mobile learning in general. These issues will be dealt with in more detail later, but in short, this paper will argue that (a) Ballance has failed to comprehend the activities described and the learning environment; and (b) Ballance has unrealistic expectations of the effect that new technologies have on learner attitudes towards using them for learning purposes.", "subject": NaN, "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2012, "identifiersgeo": NaN}, {"id": "KJ219", "title": "Power within blended language learning programs in Japan", "author": "Don Hinkelman & Paul Gruba", "description": "As blended language learning environments evolve within tertiary foreign language institutions, issues of power with regards to the privileging of electronic technologies come to the fore.

To achieve this aim, a research team conducted a longitudinal study at two Japanese universities which employed blended learning practices in their EFL programs. We analyzed ethnographic and action research data using postmodern, critical, and ecological perspectives on technology, to explore hegemony in facility planning (online vs. face-to-face), control of materials development (publisher-based vs. teacher-based authorship), and development of software designs (proprietary ownership vs. distributed teacher initiatives). Results of the study reveal three significant changes in power: (a) the construction of classrooms shifted from single-purpose CALL laboratories to blended face-to-face/online spaces, (b) the production of teaching materials emphasized locally authored multimedia materials with a decreasing reliance on mass-market course books, and (c) the design of software modules was controlled by teaching teams for rapid customization.

Apart from the logistical difficulties for both students and the organising body, this method did not leave an enduring record of the process, and raised questions about the reliability of the assessment. Over the three years of this study, we tried several approaches to using digital technology to assess oral performance, including a portfolio of sub-tasks leading up to a video-recorded oral presentation, a computer-based exam, a video recorded interview, and an online exam that included oral audio-recordings. For each of the years online marking tools supported two methods of drawing inferences about student performance from the representations: the more traditional analytical method and the comparative pairs method. Rasch analysis of the results of the two methods showed that both were at an acceptable level of reliability. Overall, students and teachers reported that they liked using audiovisual recordings and online performance tasks for revision but not for summative assessment. The study also demonstrated that the scores from externally marked computer-based oral tasks carried out in class time correlated highly with the scores from traditional face-to-face recorded interviews.

To this aim, two intact classes were selected and randomly assigned to experimental group with 35 EFL students and control group with 32 EFL students. Over the period of one term (almost 12 ninety-minute sessions), the students were aimed to co-construct and improve their writing performance, writing self-regulation, and writing self-efficacy through collaborative writing activities. In the experimental group, the EFL students received wiki-mediated collaborative writing instruction, while in the control group the EFL students experienced face-to-face (non-wiki) collaborative writing instruction. Two timed writing tasks, second language writing self-regulation and writing self-efficacy scales, and an individual semi-structured interview were conducted to collect the required data. Additionally, the types and frequencies of the students\u2019 writing mediations in the wiki-mediated collaborative writing group were identified. The quantitative data were analysed using paired samples t-tests and one-way ANCOVA, and language-related episodes and thematic analyses were applied to analyse the qualitative data.
