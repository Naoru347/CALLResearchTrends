By extracting information on 21 features from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for instructional\/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger groups or no grouping.

Forty pre-service teachers from two universities, in Poland and in Romania, exchanged emails on class-related topics; the email exchange was followed by a project evaluation questionnaire. E-mail entries and quantitative and qualitative findings from the questionnaire were analysed to evaluate the effects of participating in the keypal project on stimulating participants' reflections. Results point to considerable potential for the collaborative project as a means of evoking reflections on participants' knowledge, experience and practice. The investigation also highlighted the very positive perceptions of the participants about the value of the project for their professional training.","subject":"Action Research, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Computer Assisted Instruction, Preservice Teachers, Electronic Mail, Program Evaluation, Questionnaires, Reflection, Teacher Education, Computer Mediated Communication, Cooperation, Cross Cultural Training, Foreign Countries","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Poland, Romania"},{"id":"EJ1063788","title":"Bridging the Communication Divide: CMC and Deaf Individuals' Literacy Skills","author":"Garberoglio, Carrie Lou, Dickson, Duncan, Cawthon, Stephanie, Bond, Mark","description":"Deaf individuals frequently capitalize upon communication technologies that increase equitable access to communication in an ongoing, effortless manner. Those communication technologies create conditions that increase direct access to language and literacy. It is the lack of direct access to language that has been historically problematic for deaf individuals, contributing to English literacy achievement gaps that are evidenced in deaf education settings. This study explored the hypothesis that increased access to English through communication technologies would be related to stronger English literacy skills for deaf individuals. A secondary analysis approach using a longitudinal large-scale dataset, the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), was used to assess the frequency of computer-mediated communication as a predictor of English literacy skills in a sample of 510 deaf youths in the United States. Regression analyses demonstrated that deaf adolescents who e-mailed or chatted more frequently exhibited higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These results suggest that communication technologies should be further explored as a potential avenue that may support deaf individuals' English language and literacy development.","subject":"Deafness, Communication Skills, Literacy, Reading Skills, Longitudinal Studies, Regression (Statistics), English, Computer Mediated Communication, Electronic Mail, Reading Comprehension, Language Acquisition, Surveys, Scores, Hearing Impairments, Statistical Analysis, Correlation, Individual Characteristics, Adolescents","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1051670","title":"Supporting In-Service Language Educators in Learning to Telecollaborate","author":"O'Dowd, Robert","description":"The importance of teachers' capacity to integrate and exploit computer mediated communication (CMC) in the foreign language classroom has been recognised by many of the leading publications in foreign language teacher education, including the European Profile for Language Teacher Education (2004) and the European portfolio for student teachers of foreign languages (EPOSTL) (2007). One of the essential CMC activities in foreign language education is undoubtedly telecollaboration. This is the application of online communication tools to connect classes of language learners in geographically distant locations with the aim of developing their foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative tasks and project work (O'Dowd, 2007). This paper begins by presenting a model of competences for the telecollaborative teacher, which has been developed and verified by this author (2013) using the Delphi technique. The paper then presents UNICollaboration (www.unicollaboration.eu), an online platform, which has been developed reflecting these competences and a sociocultural approach to teacher education. Following that, the findings of four qualitative case studies of novice telecollaborators are used to inform the design of tools and training courses for educators in this complex activity of online foreign language education.","subject":"Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Language Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Competencies, Delphi Technique, Teacher Education, Case Studies, Cooperative Learning, Technological Literacy, Teacher Attitudes, College Faculty, Interviews, Foreign Countries","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Argentina, California, Italy"},{"id":"EJ1051723","title":"Learning to Identify and Actualize Affordances in a New Tool","author":"Haines, Karen J.","description":"Keeping abreast of new technologies and the opportunities they offer is a challenge for inservice teachers (Blake, 2008; Egbert, Akasha, Huff, &amp; Lee, 2011; Hanson-Smith, 2006; Hubbard, 2007; Robb, 2006). An important aspect of teacher learning about the use of technology is the ability to identify the affordances of new tools and how they can support learning in the language classroom (Hampel &amp; Stickler, 2005; Kessler, 2010). This fourteen-month-long longitudinal study of the learning of two experienced foreign language teachers working together describes how their perceptions of the affordances of two computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools developed over time. Interview data collected over three semesters demonstrated how teachers' perceptions of affordance evolve through classroom practice with technology, and how such perceptions might be transferred to the use of a new tool. As well, although the two teachers used the same tools (blogs and wikis) in the same courses and, at times, with the same classes, they perceived different learning affordances in relation to the language learning processes they prioritized. The article will conclude with suggestions for ways in which a better understanding of affordance in teacher knowledge development has implications for the support of in-service language teachers' learning.","subject":"Educational Technology, Longitudinal Studies, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Attitudes, Teaching Methods, Second Language Learning, Electronic Publishing, Web Sites, Case Studies, Interviews, Italian, Foreign Countries, College Faculty, Adult Students","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1075832","title":"Wikipedia Writing as Praxis: Computer-Mediated Socialization of Second-Language Writers","author":"King, Brian W.","description":"This study explores the writing of Wikipedia articles as a form of authentic writing for learners of English in Hong Kong. Adopting &quot;Second Language Socialization and Language Learning &amp; Identity&quot; approaches to language learning inquiry, it responds to an identified shortage of research on computer-mediated language socialization. Focus is placed on the development of participant identities as valid writers of English texts for a perceived mass public. As part of Wikipedia writing praxis, writers are socialized to varying degrees into the community of Wikipedia. This study focuses on Hong Kong university students' reported experiences as legitimate peripheral participants, looking at the early stages of potential community membership. Ethnographic observations serve to provide a description of both the classroom and the Wikipedia site as dynamic social settings. Data sources include field notes, participant-generated written reflections, and transcripts of focus group interviews. Through these various channels it becomes clear that perception of a potentially vast reading public wields a subtle but important influence. Experiences with the Wikipedia community also play a role, motivating some participants to think deeply about their writing and prompting them to invest in writer identities online and in their local context.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Encyclopedias, Collaborative Writing, Electronic Publishing, Praxis, Computer Mediated Communication, Socialization, English (Second Language), College Students, Communities of Practice, Ethnography, Field Studies, Reflection, Focus Groups, Audience Awareness, Influences, Web 2.0 Technologies, Social Status, Discourse Analysis, Writing Processes, Transcripts (Written Records), Self Concept","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hong Kong"},{"id":"EJ1075808","title":"Commenting to Learn: Evidence of Language and Intercultural Learning in Comments on YouTube Videos","author":"Benson, Phil","description":"It is often observed that the globalization of social media has opened up new opportunities for informal intercultural communication and foreign language learning. This study aims to go beyond this general observation through a case study that explores how discourse analysis tools might be used to uncover evidence of language and intercultural learning in comments on YouTube videos involving Chinese-English translanguaging. Analysis of exchange structure--interactional acts involving information exchange and stance marking--suggests that translanguaging triggers interactionally-rich comments that are oriented towards information exchange and negotiation for meaning on topics of language and culture. It is argued that the methodologies used have good potential for use in studies that aim to investigate learning in online settings, both at the environmental level, in macroanalysis of large data sets, and at the individual\/situational level, in microanalysis of shorter interactional sequences.","subject":"Social Networks, Internet, Video Technology, Electronic Publishing, Web Sites, Intercultural Communication, Discourse Analysis, Second Language Learning, Chinese, English, Bilingualism, Code Switching (Language), Translation, Computer Mediated Communication, Language Usage, Interaction Process Analysis, Persuasive Discourse, Cognitive Processes","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1063806","title":"The Practices and Challenges of Telecollaboration in Higher Education in Europe","author":"Helm, Francesca","description":"Telecollaboration is an area of CALL research and practice which has developed considerably in the last twenty years. Many research studies have been carried out and important findings have been made, but there has not yet been a large scale survey to try and &quot;map&quot; the state of the art in telecollaboration practice. Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to how to meet these challenges and how telecollaboration practice could become mainstreamed in higher education.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Videoconferencing, Surveys, Educational Practices, Teacher Attitudes, Barriers, College Faculty, Language Teachers, Teaching Methods, Positive Attitudes, Time Management, Technical Support, Teacher Student Relationship, College Students, Computer Mediated Communication, Cooperative Learning, Foreign Countries, Profiles, Questionnaires, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1063802","title":"L2 Blogging: Who Thrives and Who Does Not?","author":"Chen, Rainbow Tsai-Hung","description":"While research has reported generally enthusiastic results regarding L2 blogging, some studies have found contrasting blogging experiences among individual learners. Consequently, this study investigated the factors underlying such discrepancies by exploring 33 EFL learners' experiences of participating in a blog project at a Taiwanese university. The students wrote personal blogs and responded to each other over a ten-week period. Data was collected through a questionnaire and individual interviews with 10 of the students. Drawing on a sociological approach, specialization codes of legitimation (Maton, 2007, 2014), the study found salient differences in the students' educational beliefs and practices, which appeared to be linked to their positive or negative blogging experiences. By analyzing the relations between the pedagogical design, learners' existing educational dispositions, and their blogging experiences, the study argued that the blog project assumed learners of a certain type--those who recognized themselves as &quot;knowers&quot; in terms of their blog content--while disadvantaging others who did not possess this attribute. Practitioners are therefore advised to exercise caution when designing blog activities.","subject":"Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), College Students, Computer Mediated Communication, Web Sites, Electronic Publishing, Questionnaires, Interviews, Student Attitudes, Student Behavior, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Foreign Countries, Web 2.0 Technologies, Statistical Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1063743","title":"Negotiation of Meaning to Comprehend Hypertexts through Peer Questioning","author":"Yang, Yu-Fen, Hsieh, Pei-Yin","description":"Many college students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL) are less-proficient readers as they have few opportunities to negotiate their perspectives for creating meaning through peer questioning in onsite instruction. This study reports on using online peer questioning to enhance less-proficient college students' negotiation of meaning in comprehending texts. A sample of 50 college students was divided into two groups based on the pre-test, into a more-proficient group and a less-proficient group, with 25 students in each group. The results of this study reveal that the less-proficient students made greater progress in reading comprehension than the more-proficient students after using the strategy of online peer questioning. The less-proficient students were able to explicitly observe how the more-proficient peers used integration questions, agreed or disagreed with peer responses, and finally constructed new understandings of the hypertexts. Particularly, the less-proficient students learned from the more-proficient peers on how to engage in critical thinking to express and share multiple perspectives. Using online peer questioning, both the more-and the less-proficient students frequently engaged in negotiation of meaning, interaction, and teaching one another. Their reading progress was reflected in the post-test, the types of questions and responses, and their perceptions toward using online peer questioning.","subject":"English (Second Language), College Students, Reading Comprehension, Language Proficiency, Blended Learning, Cooperative Learning, Questioning Techniques, Group Discussion, Pretests Posttests, Hypermedia, Statistical Analysis, Computer Mediated Communication, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Semi Structured Interviews","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1075822","title":"Contributing, Creating, Curating: Digital Literacies for Language Learners","author":"Godwin-Jones, Robert","description":"In today's globalized, connected world, fixed and stable identities are increasingly uncommon. The means and modes of online communication and engagement, themselves powerful contributors to identity formation, are likewise in a constant state of flux. Participating in emerging online communities may require users to develop new skills, acquire specific software or hardware, and\/or learn particular conventions and behavior norms. In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities. Capability in a full range of digital literacies is key to that process and vital today in education, personal life, and work environments: The growing importance of online technologies for the ways in which we work and learn in global networks has meant that today, instead of using technology simply to learn FLs [foreign languages], learners need to learn how to combine both FL skills and &quot;e-skills&quot; or &quot;new literacies&quot; to be able to work and collaborate in new contexts where the borders between the visual and the real and between the distant and the proximate are increasingly blurred (Dooly &amp; O'Dowd, 2012, p. 15). That blurring of boundaries among literacies, genres, and modes of representation is what makes this topic intriguing and challenging.","subject":"Technological Literacy, Second Language Learning, Incidental Learning, Skill Development, Communities of Practice, Literacy, Second Language Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Role, Language Teachers, Learning Motivation, Personal Autonomy, Cultural Awareness, Work Environment, Information Literacy","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1075828","title":"Using Facebook to Promote Korean EFL Learners' Intercultural Competence","author":"Jin, Seunghee","description":"Foreign language learners often have limited opportunity to interact with people from the target culture and develop their intercultural competence (IC) through those interactions both inside and outside of the classroom.

The findings reveal that, on the one hand, the students were able to identify the power relations between characters as well as how particular characters are marginalized in the media texts they viewed by paying attention to the multiple modes that make up the text's representation. On the other hand, the students were able to articulate the ideological subtexts they identified through the orchestration of various modes rather than relying on the linguistic mode, making their message as persuasive and effective as those in the media texts viewed.","subject":"Media Literacy, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Power Structure, Semiotics, Films, Teaching Methods, Racial Relations, Gender Differences, Interpersonal Relationship, College Students, Second Language Instruction, Critical Literacy, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Focus Groups, Interviews","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"}]
