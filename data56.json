[{"id":"EJ1047685","title":"University Teachers' Perceptions of Online Informal Learning of English (OILE)","author":"Toffoli, Denyze, Sockett, Geoff","description":"Online Informal Learning of English (OILE) involves the many different types of language practices that non-specialist EFL students of English are involved in on the Internet. This article reviews previous studies in the area and summarises the specific outcomes that OILE is thought to produce. It then presents an analysis of a survey of teachers' cognitions concerning OILE from a sample of 30 professors of English working in French universities. It analyses survey data in various manners, offering insight into teachers' awareness of the OILE phenomenon amongst students, the perceived or imagined effects of these practices on their students' English and the ways they do or do not integrate these cognitions into their own teaching. Results indicate that many professors are aware of the types of input that their learners may be exposed to, but that they know little of the specifics and few make use of this knowledge in their English courses. In the discussion some questions are raised as to future forms for English language teaching to specialists of other disciplines.","subject":"Online Courses, Teacher Attitudes, Informal Education, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Surveys, Schemata (Cognition), College Faculty, Foreign Countries, Second Language Instruction, Futures (of Society), Teaching Methods","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"France"},{"id":"EJ1059236","title":"Factors Affecting the Normalization of CALL in Chinese Senior High Schools","author":"He, Bi, Puakpong, Nattaya, Lian, Andrew","description":"With the development of Information Technology, increasing attention has been paid to Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Meanwhile, increasing enthusiasm is seen for English learning and teaching in China. Yet, few research studies have focused on the normalization of CALL in ethnically diverse areas. In response to this research gap, this study aims to identify major factors affecting the normalization of CALL in Chinese senior high schools in the Qian Xi'nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture (QBMP). A questionnaire was administered to 340 English teachers and a semi-structured oral interview was conducted as a follow-up. The study produced the following four findings: (a) most teachers were in favor of using computers in English teaching although they had to be cautious in guiding students; (b) institutional support was seen as instrumental; (c) teachers' computer competency and relevant training were considered to be important; and (d) teaching methodology and learner factors were identified as crucial.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High Schools, English Teachers, Secondary School Teachers, Questionnaires, Semi Structured Interviews, Teacher Attitudes, Computer Attitudes, Computer Literacy, Teaching Methods","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"id":"EJ1047667","title":"Flipping the Classroom for English Language Learners to Foster Active Learning","author":"Hung, Hsiu-Ting","description":"This paper describes a structured attempt to integrate flip teaching into language classrooms using a WebQuest active learning strategy.

In the search for ways to augment an EFL curriculum in which speaking practice is limited but the demand for improving oral proficiencies is high, this study explored the use of voice blogging to develop communication skills, analyzed the stages of students' blogging efforts, and investigated students' perceptions of this authentic language experience. Seventy-four intermediate EFL learners from two Freshman English classes at a national university in Taiwan participated in this study. During the semester-long experiment, students read online materials and used an instructional blogging site constructed by the teacher-researcher to post voice blog entries and comment on peers' blog posts. The recursive four stages of their blogging efforts were: reading to learn, planning and organizing, speaking, and sharing. In a post-task survey and in semi-structured interviews, students said they felt that the process of producing voice blog entries facilitated language learning, enhanced knowledge construction, and promoted social networking. Students also offered suggestions for ways to improve the project, such as teaching more online search skills, providing better online recording mechanisms, and setting up a combination of face-to-face and online interactions. This study's findings and suggestions for future voice blogging projects can serve as a template for integrating voice blogging into the EFL curriculum.","subject":"Web 2.0 Technologies, Semi Structured Interviews, Electronic Publishing, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Surveys, Foreign Countries, College Freshmen, Language Proficiency, Oral Language, Computer Mediated Communication, Language Processing, Student Attitudes, Social Networks, Search Strategies, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Computer Assisted Instruction, Web Sites, Feedback (Response)","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1059267","title":"Blogs and the Development of Plurilingual and Intercultural Competence: Report of a Co-Actional Approach in Portuguese Foreign Language Classroom","author":"Melo-Pfeifer, S\u00edlvia","description":"Focusing on the topic of the development of the plurilingual and intercultural competence through the integration of electronic communicative practices both in foreign language classrooms and non-formal contexts, this work aims at defining and characterizing, in view of a co-actional perspective, a &quot;pedagogical blog&quot;, by considering it from three different axes: a personal and social dimension, a collaborative and co-actional dimension and the management of linguistic and cultural repertoires dimension.

It also surveys the learners' attitudes towards the role of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to examine the effects of the treatments given over 10 sessions on L2 collocations in the receptive and productive tasks. Results demonstrated that the three groups of participants who received the treatment tasks in the context of concordancing under symmetrical, asymmetrical, and no-scaffolding conditions, improved their knowledge of collocations significantly both in the receptive and productive tasks compared to the control group which had no access to concordancing and did not receive scaffolding.

To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness. The system's functions overcame the limitations of observing students' metacognitive processes described in previous studies, and enabled teachers to provide follow-up instruction.

To date, however, there is still limited understanding of how EFL writers may make use of such tools along with dictionaries when engaging in a writing task. To better understand the question, this study investigated a class of non-English-major college students (N = 14) over a semester. Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning.

Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels.
