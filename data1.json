This study aimed to determine the effect of dynamic geometry software (DGS) in activating the GHoM of pre-service mathematics teachers. The study was conducted with six teacher candidates who were enrolled in a semester-long course titled &quot;Computer Assisted Mathematics Teaching&quot; that entailed a focus on GHoM. In order to identify the impact of the DGS on their GHoM, clinical interviews were conducted with the participants before and after the course wherein they were asked questions relating to each habit. The preliminary interviews showed that, prior to the intervention, the pre-service teachers primarily used the software in the context of the habits of &quot;exploration and reflection&quot; and &quot;visualizing geometric shapes&quot; to find the solution of a given problem. On the other hand, the post-intervention interviews revealed that the DGS supported the habits of &quot;investigating invariants,&quot; &quot;reasoning with relationships&quot; and &quot;considering specific cases and generalizing geometric ideas.&quot; This paper discusses how the DGS supported each habit.","subject":"Cognitive Processes, Problem Solving, Geometry, Computer Software, Preservice Teachers, Mathematics Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Mathematics Instruction, Intervention, Program Effectiveness","source":"E-Learning and Digital Media","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Using OVIP Online: A Teacher-Mediated Computer-Assisted Programme for Pupils with Reading Difficulties","author":"Dimitrellou, Eleni, Macmillan, Philip, Norwich, Brahm","description":"School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the overriding need to create engaging online learning environments to facilitate students' learning. This paper focuses on the online evaluation of Own-Voice Intensive Phonics (OVIP) approach, a computer-assisted instruction programme used during the COVID restrictions to help 15 pupils aged 7-12 with reading difficulties improve their reading. Analysis of Single Word Reading pre-and-post-test revealed a 3.2-year mean word reading age gain over a 19- to 22-week period. Questionnaire data from pupils and parents and the end of OVIP session and parent-reported data at a one-year follow-up demonstrated an overall increase in pupil reading skills and self-confidence that transferred into wider confidence and engagement for some pupils. Findings indicate that OVIP might be an effective teacher-mediated programme in supporting pupils with reading difficulties to enhance their reading skills through online tutoring. Further research is necessary to compare teacher-mediated own voice approaches to unmediated programmes, using a larger sample.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Reading Instruction, Reading Difficulties, Electronic Learning, Program Evaluation, COVID-19, Pandemics, Elementary School Students, Reading Improvement, Reading Skills, Self Esteem","source":"Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Learning Challenging L2 Sounds via Computer-Assisted Training: Audiovisual Training with an Airflow Model","author":"Chen, Fei, Xia, Quansheng, Feng, Yan, Wang, Lan, Peng, Gang","description":"Background: Teaching Mandarin as a second language (L2) has become an important profession and an important research area. The acquisition of unaspirated and aspirated consonants in Mandarin has been reported to be rather challenging for L2 learners. Objectives: In the current study, a 3-D airflow model was integrated into the virtual talking head for audiovisual pronunciation training in these Mandarin consonants. Methods: Using the eye-tracking technique, Experiment 1 investigated L2 learners' general acceptance and gauged attention distribution online while learning with the system. To further compare training efficacy, learning outcomes were evaluated by randomly dividing Japanese learners of Mandarin into different training groups using the 3-D tutor with and without an airflow model, respectively, in Experiment 2. Results and Conclusions: Eye-tracking results showed that the talking head was well accepted, and was successful in directing L2 learners' attention to the visual modality of the airflow model marking the contrast in aspiration. Furthermore, the additional visual cue of the airflow model helped enhance their production of the aspirated Mandarin stops. Moreover, this computer-assisted training approach was shown to be robust as the advantage of training with an airflow model can be generalized to novel syllables with a change of tones or rimes.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Mandarin Chinese, Models, Pronunciation Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness, Eye Movements, Outcomes of Education, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Visual Aids, Cues, Articulation (Speech), Training Methods","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Effect of the Modality Principle to Support Learning with Virtual Reality: An Eye-Tracking and Electrodermal Activity Study","author":"Liberman, Liat, Dubovi, Ilana","description":"Background: Virtual reality (VR) is considered a promising approach to support learning. An instructional design is essential to optimize cognitive processes. Studies show that VR has unique instructional and pedagogical requirements. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the modality principle, which was previously validated in 2D classic multimedia, for learning with VR. The modality principle states that multimedia information presented as spoken narration is superior to on-screen text. Methods: A prospective experimental study with two compared conditions of instruction: VR-based learning guided by on-screen text (n = 34) versus spoken narration (n = 28). Students' cognitive learning experiences were captured by eye-tracking and electrodermal activity (EDA). In addition, students' knowledge was evaluated using a pre-post knowledge test. Results and Conclusions: Overall, there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the participants who learned with on-screen text compared to spoken narration. However, results from the eye-tracking analysis showed that students who learned with the on-screen text devoted longer visual attention toward important learning activity areas of interest, suggesting a better ability to discern between relevant and irrelevant information. Conversely, students who learned with the spoken narration expressed significantly more EDA peak responses, proposing a higher cognitive load. Implications: This study outlines that while learning with VR was effective, the modality principle might not apply to learning with VR. Moreover, the analysis of the learning process suggests even an inverse effect, favouring the provision of instructional scaffolds as on-screen text. Future research should evaluate this effect on long-term knowledge retention.","subject":"Eye Movements, Retention (Psychology), Computer Simulation, Instructional Design, Cognitive Processes, Instructional Effectiveness, Multimedia Instruction, Teaching Methods, Comparative Analysis, Speech Communication, Computer Assisted Instruction, Cognitive Ability, Knowledge Level, Tests, Physiology","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Towards a Signature Pedagogy for Technology-Enhanced Task-Based Language Teaching: Defining Its Design Principles","author":"Canals, Laia, Mor, Yishay","description":"This paper reports on ongoing research aimed at characterizing a signature pedagogy (Shulman, 2005) of technology-enhanced task-based language teaching (TETBLT).

Since English language learners (ELLs), or students who first acquired a language other than English, continue to underperform in reading compared to their English-speaking peers, they are particularly at-risk for reading and academic difficulties. The current study examines the utility and acceptability of teaching letter sounds to four ELL preschoolers through a software-based incremental rehearsal tool (Tutoring Buddy). All students demonstrated increases in LSK, with large effect sizes derived through percentage of all nonoverlapping data\u00a0analyses. Increases were also noted in the students' generalization of letter sounds to measures of letter sound fluency\u00a0and nonsense word fluency, signified by small to large effect sizes. Large effect sizes generated for real word fluency measures indicated that all students were able to apply LSK to decoding real, consonant-vowel-consonant\u00a0words. All students rated Tutoring Buddy as helpful for their letter sound learning, and varied in how enjoyable they found the intervention to be. Overall, the results support the use of Tutoring Buddy as an effective and acceptable method for teaching letter sounds to young ELLs.

We collected data during three weeks of fieldwork at a Norwegian secondary school. We found that informal and formal language teaching and learning were connected in two ways: the students' use of English outside school was primarily linked to online game play and social media, and the teacher was able to design activities that extended her students' existing affinity space, resulting in the students using English in the classroom more frequently and more confidently than before. Implications include the importance of understanding students' informal language learning to rethink L2 teaching practices.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Informal Education, English (Second Language), Computer Games, Language Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Social Media, Learning Activities, Educational Change, Instructional Design, Secondary School Students, Foreign Countries, Correlation, Language Usage, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Attitudes, Classroom Communication","source":"ELT Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Norway"},{"title":"Grit and Learning: Understanding the Sequential Learning Behaviours in Snap!","author":"Gao, Ming, Zhang, Jingjing, Lu, Yu, Kahn, Ken, Winters, Niall","description":"Background: As a non-cognitive trait, grit plays an important role in human learning.

Objectives: This study attempted to explore how students with different levels of grit behave and learn in an exploratory learning environment. Methods: In this study, 66 students participated in seven exploratory tasks in Snap! for approximately 60 min after a 30-min lecture. Students were categorized into a high grit group and low grit group using a grit scale. The Mann-Whitney U test, epistemic network analysis and lag sequential analysis were used to explore the differences between groups in learning performance, technology acceptance and behavioural patterns. Results: Students with different levels of grit engaged in explorative tasks in a short period of time might not present significantly different learning performance, perceptions of usefulness and ease of use, but students higher in grit, actively engaging more different types of activities, tended to put greater sustained effort to solve the challenging task. Take Away: Although grit was not significantly correlated with learning performance when students engage in classroom-based explorative activities, grit did predict whether students are more likely to explore and put greater sustained effort into solving the challenging task.","subject":"Resilience (Psychology), Academic Persistence, Personality Traits, Usability, Learning Processes, Task Analysis, Classification, Comparative Analysis, Measures (Individuals), Prediction, Learning Activities, Sequential Learning, Network Analysis, Correlation, Lecture Method, Computer Assisted Instruction, Computer Software","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Anxiety Only Makes It Worse: Exploring the Impact Mechanisms of App-Based Learning on Performance Progress","author":"Li, Yuhao, Chang, Mengyi, Zhao, Hanxuan, Jiang, Caihong, Xu, Sihua","description":"Background: Mobile devices facilitate learning activities in a self-paced way. However, the current understanding of learning participation and its consequence are minimal when learners take advantage of opportunities provided by mobile technologies worldwide. Aims: The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of environmental incentives on app learning behaviour and learning performance based on a multi-dimensional approach. We also evaluate whether the role of anxiety attenuates these influences. Method and objective: In this study, 323 participants' learning activities were tracked weekly to measure the completion of their daily learning plan during 16 weeks.

This could negatively affect the contributions of the female gender to national development. There was a need to advance a setting that enhances the participation of women in technology education. Aims: This study evaluated desktop Virtual Reality (VR) to know whether it enhances equal academic achievement and learning interests of female and male students. Materials and Methods: A toss of a coin was used to divide the six universities into two major groups; three universities were taught with ElectricVlab, while the other three universities were taught in the conventional classroom. Each of the six intact classes sat in clusters of five students and the whole class was taught the construction of an audio amplifier together using a demonstration method of teaching. A Vocational Interest scale and a researcher-made achievement test with reliability coefficient=0.89 were used for data collection. Two-way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse means and test hypotheses at a 0.05 level of significance. Results: The study found no significant difference between the mean achievement and interests of female and male students in the VR group. There was a significant interaction effect between gender and teaching environment. This study predicts that VR could bring women up to the same level of interest and achievement as men, but conventional classroom methods could not. Conclusions: Curriculum planners should consider piloting virtual reality to enhance gender-fair education, as it shows initial promise in the teaching of electronic technology education. Virtual reality for teaching and learning can be a part of postgraduate studies in universities, especially in academic fields where virtual reality has been found effective. This study may guide other studies and add to available literature.","subject":"Computer Simulation, Employment Opportunities, Females, Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Technology Education, Equal Education, Academic Achievement, Student Interests, College Students, Computer Assisted Instruction, Conventional Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness, Vocational Interests, Achievement Tests, Gender Differences, Educational Technology","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Potential of Simulation Assessments in Professional Development","author":"Dove, Anthony, Borland, Jennifer, Wiley, Caroline R.

Under such a framework, the current study focuses on how the familiarity of stimuli will affect learning Chinese phonetic skills in a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) environment. Two training conditions, i.e., training with familiar stimuli from the textbook and unfamiliar stimuli from novelty design, were administered for two groups of learners at American universities, where the classroom instructions were integrated with the Pinyin Tutor--an online spoken Chinese learning platform hosted under TalkBank. The results show that training with novelty stimuli leads to a greater pretest-posttest improvement for intermediate learners, whereas more significant improvement has been observed in training with familiar stimuli among beginning learners. The learning-enhancing power of the Pinyin Tutor is evidenced by the overall significance of the pretest-posttest improvement when consolidating the results of the two conditions. Furthermore, high retention has been demonstrated in all six aspects of the Pinyin knowledge as tested by a three-month-after delayed posttest. These findings tend to endorse a differentiated design of instructional materials with increasing novelty components as the level of L2 learning advances. The overall significant learning-boosting results accredit the design of the Pinyin Tutor, where the technological architecture and algorithms were integrated with psycholinguistic and pedagogical theories.

Although previous research has supported the effectiveness of these instructional methods in multimedia learning, it remains unclear whether segmentation, summarization or the combination of both are superior to a stand-alone IVR lesson in facilitating learning. Methods: To address this gap, 190 sixth to seventh grade students learned about the human body in an IVR lesson. Students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (a) an IVR lesson divided into four segments (segmentation condition); (b) an IVR lesson, where students summarized after the entire lesson (summarizing condition); (c) an IVR lesson presented in four segments, where students summarized after each segment (combined condition); and (d) an IVR lesson without any manipulation (control condition). Results: Results indicated that, compared to the control condition, adding segmentation or summarization to an IVR lesson leads to better transfer, but not to acquiring more factual knowledge. Combining the two methods did not improve learning. Conclusion: The findings support the evidence that choosing appropriate instructional methods for IVR lessons can foster transfer.","subject":"Computer Simulation, Computer Uses in Education, Secondary School Students, STEM Education, Multimedia Instruction, Synthesis, Documentation, Learning Strategies, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Technology-Enhanced Assessment: A Survey of Machine Learning","author":"Caspari-Sadeghi, Sima","description":"Intelligent assessment, the core of any AI-based educational technology, is defined as embedded, stealth and ubiquitous assessment which uses intelligent techniques to diagnose the current cognitive level, monitor dynamic progress, predict success and update students' profiling continuously.

However, few studies have investigated the lasting effects of using HMDs in an authentic instructional intervention. Objectives: We investigated the effects of a one-time experience of a virtual field trip to Greenland in a sample of 105 middle school students. Methods: Students used either a standard 2D video (video condition; N = 50) or an HMD (HMD condition; N = 55) as part of a six-lesson educational activity on the topic of climate change. Informed by social cognitive career theory (SCCT), we investigated the effects of the different conditions (video vs. HMD) on the outcomes of self-efficacy, outcome expectations, interest, and science intentions across three time points. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that using the HMD-based virtual field trip, compared to the video, had a positive immediate effect on self-efficacy and interest, and total later effects on self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and interest an average of two and a half weeks after the virtual field trip. The results suggest that HMD-based virtual field trips can influence self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and interest more than a video-based virtual field trip when measured approximately two and a half weeks after the intervention.","subject":"Science Interests, Computer Simulation, Science Instruction, Authentic Learning, Field Trips, Middle School Students, Foreign Countries, Video Technology, Climate, Self Efficacy, Outcomes of Education","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Greenland"},{"title":"Using Learning Analytics to Investigate Learning Processes and Behavioural Patterns in an Augmented Reality Language Learning Environment","author":"Geng, Xuewang, Yamada, Masanori","description":"Background: Augmented reality has been widely applied in various fields, and its benefits in language learning have been increasingly recognized. However, the investigation of effective learning behaviours and processes in augmented reality learning environments, taking into account temporality and analysis of differences in learning behaviours between learning achievements from the perspective of learning strategies, is still a topic that requires further research. Objectives: The goal of this research is to explore effective learning processes in AR language learning environments and learning behavioural patterns of learners with different performance levels via LA taking into account temporality. Methods: We used the learning application designed and developed in previous studies to understand the learning process and behavioural patterns of acquiring Japanese compound verbs with augmented reality. Lag sequential analyses were conducted to analyse the learning behavioural transitions using learning data. Additionally, frequent sequences were analysed using frequent sequence mining to compare the learning behavioural patterns of learners with different learning performances. Results and Conclusions: We investigated the learning process and behavioural patterns and discussed the language learning strategies employed in the augmented reality learning environment. The results indicated that learners primarily performed strategies of performed expressions, recombining, and structured reviewing in AR compound verb learning activities. Furthermore, the results revealed the different types of strategies applied by different learning performance learners, whereby the low group learners used the least variety of strategies, and the middle and high group learners employed repeating and deductive reasoning strategies that were not followed by the low group.","subject":"Learning Analytics, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Learning Processes, Japanese, Verbs, Comparative Analysis, Computer Simulation, Behavior Patterns, Learning Strategies, Learning Activities","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Development of a Computer-Aided Education System Inspired by Face-to-Face Learning by Incorporating EEG-Based Neurofeedback into Online Video Lectures","author":"Kim, Hodam, Chae, Younsoo, Kim, Suhye, Im, Chang-Hwan","description":"Owing to the rapid development of information and communication technologies, online or mobile learning content is widely available on the Internet. Unlike traditional face-to-face learning, online learning exhibits a critical limitation: real-time interactions between learners and teachers are generally not feasible in online learning. To overcome this issue, we implemented an online learning system based on electroencephalography (EEG)-based passive brain-computer interface technology referred to as the &quot;adaptive neuro-learning system (ANLS).&quot; It monitors the current mental states of learners seamlessly using EEG signals. Then, it adaptively provides natural and interactive video feedback rather than simple alarms or pop quizzes following the current mental conditions of a learner. In this article, a total of 60 university students were assigned randomly to one of four groups: two experimental groups, for which either ANLS based on attention state estimation or ANLS based on both attention and comprehension states estimation was tested, and two control groups, the students in which were taught using either the conventional online lecture without feedback or an online course with randomized video feedbacks. Each member of these groups attended a 53 min open courseware video lecture. Then, the educational effects of the proposed system were evaluated quantitatively via a written examination. Our results revealed a significantly higher learning performance for the experimental group (average test score of the experimental groups = 83.83 and that of the control groups = 56.67), demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed education strategy.","subject":"College Students, Control Groups, Attention, Comprehension, Electronic Learning, Online Courses, Learning Processes, Computer Assisted Instruction, Feedback (Response), Medicine, Educational Practices, Learning Analytics, Brain","source":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Analysing Adaptive Scaffolds That Help Students Develop Self-Regulated Learning Behaviours","author":"Munshi, Anabil, Biswas, Gautam, Baker, Ryan, Ocumpaugh, Jaclyn, Hutt, Stephen, Paquette, Luc","description":"Background: Providing adaptive scaffolds to help learners develop effective self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviours has been an important goal for intelligent learning environments. Adaptive scaffolding is especially important in open-ended learning environments (OELE), where novice learners often face difficulties in completing their learning tasks. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic framework for adaptive scaffolding in Betty's Brain, a learning-by-teaching OELE for middle school science, where students construct a causal model to teach a virtual agent, generically named Betty. We evaluate the adaptive scaffolding framework and discuss its implications on the development of more effective scaffolds for SRL in OELEs. Methods: We detect key cognitive\/metacognitive &quot;inflection points,&quot; that is, moments where students' behaviours and performance change during learning, often suggesting an inability to apply effective learning strategies. At inflection points, Mr. Davis (&quot;a mentor agent in Betty's Brain&quot;) or Betty (&quot;the teachable agent&quot;) provides context-specific conversational feedback, focusing on strategies to help the student become a more productive learner, or encouragement to support positive emotions. We conduct a classroom study with 98 middle schoolers to analyse the impact of adaptive scaffolds on students' learning behaviours and performance. We analyse how students with differential pre-to-post learning outcomes receive and use the scaffolds to support their subsequent learning process in Betty's Brain. Results and Conclusions: Adaptive scaffolding produced mixed results, with some scaffolds (viz., strategic hints that supported debugging and assessment of causal models) being generally more useful to students than others (viz., encouragement prompts). Additionally, there were differences in how students with high versus low learning outcomes responded to some hints, as suggested by the differences in their learning behaviours and performance in the intervals after scaffolding. Overall, our findings suggest how adaptive scaffolding in OELEs like Betty's Brain can be further improved to better support SRL behaviours and narrow the learning outcomes gap between high and low performing students. Implications: This paper contributes to our understanding and impact of adaptive scaffolding in OELEs. The results of our study indicate that successful scaffolding has to combine context-sensitive inflection points with conversational feedback that is tailored to the students' current proficiency levels and needs. Also, our conceptual framework can be used to design adaptive scaffolds that help students develop and apply SRL behaviours in other computer-based learning environments.","subject":"Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Metacognition, Independent Study, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Causal Models, Learning Processes, Novices, Guidelines, Teaching Methods, Student Behavior, Behavior Change, Learning Strategies, Instructional Effectiveness, Feedback (Response), Middle School Students, Cues, Outcomes of Education, Computer Assisted Instruction","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Exploring the Relationship between Process Data and Contextual Variables among Scandinavian Students on PISA 2012 Mathematics Tasks","author":"Costa, Denise Reis, Chen, Chia-Wen","description":"Given the ongoing development of computer-based tasks, there has been increasing interest in modelling students' behaviour indicators from log file data with contextual variables collected via questionnaires. In this work, we apply a latent regression model to analyse the relationship between latent constructs (i.e., performance, speed, and exploration behaviour) and contextual variables among Scandinavian students (i.e., Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) during their completion of three interactive mathematics tasks in the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to investigate whether a factor model is adequate for explaining the relationship between extracted process indicators from log files and students' performance on the three items; (2) to evaluate whether measurement invariance holds for the three analysed countries; and (3) to determine how well contextual variables [i.e., a student's background, availability, use of information and communication technology (ICT) resources, and learning conditions for mathematical literacy] correlate with the model's latent constructs. Our findings reveal that a three-factor CFA model is well-suited to the analysed data and that a weak measurement invariance model performs best. By including contextual variables in the modelling, we also highlight the differences in Scandinavian students' profiles. Specifically, higher economic social cultural status (ESCS) consistently led to higher math proficiency across all three countries. Norway did not show any gender differences in math proficiency, response time, or exploration behaviours. Experience with math tasks at school led to more exploration behaviours across all three countries. Swedish and Norwegian students who had more experience with pure math tasks at school were likely to obtain higher mathematics achievement scores and tended to interact more frequently with the testing platform when answering the three math items. When Danish students had higher ICT scores (i.e., more ICT resources available at school and home), they had lower response accuracy. There was, however, no effect of ICT on the three factors among Swedish and Norwegian students. Finally, we also discuss the implications and limitations of this study.","subject":"Achievement Tests, Secondary School Students, International Assessment, Foreign Countries, Mathematics Instruction, Task Analysis, Correlation, Mathematics Tests, Context Effect, Factor Structure, Profiles, Comparative Analysis, Socioeconomic Status, Mathematics Achievement, Computer Assisted Testing, Access to Computers, Technological Literacy, Cross Cultural Studies, Reaction Time, Gender Differences","source":"Large-scale Assessments in Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Scandinavia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden"},{"title":"Jordanian University Instructors&apos; Perspectives on Emergency Remote Teaching during COVID-19: Humanities vs Sciences","author":"Haider, Ahmad S., Al-Salman, Saleh","description":"Purpose: The study aims to probe into university instructors' reactions to adopting the remote online learning model brought by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The study investigates the instructors' perspectives, in the humanities and science classes, on the effectiveness of the emergency remote teaching (ERT) compared to face-to-face teaching. Design\/methodology\/approach: The data for the study were compiled from the responses of 127 instructors representing two private universities in middle and northern Jordan. The sample included 66 faculty members in the humanities and 61 in the sciences. The instructors' responses were elicited through a Likert-type questionnaire consisting of 20 items. Findings: The present study's findings have shown that online instruction is becoming more common despite the presence of some major challenges facing instructors. The results showed that the e-learning system seems to better suit the humanities courses compared to the sciences courses. The findings also showed that faculty members in the humanities are more satisfied with the effectiveness of the assessment tools utilized in the online courses than their colleagues in the sciences. In addition, humanities e-courses seem to provide a more interactive learning environment than e-courses in the sciences. Practical implications: More training for instructors on how to design online course syllabi to ensure effective delivery is needed. Instructors need to develop ways to encourage students to interact in virtual e-classes to the same level as the on-ground classes. Instructors also need to adopt the &quot;blended learning&quot; system as a transitional stage before switching completely to online learning.

The most recent meta-analyses on various types of mobile technology use for potential benefits of learning covered the empirical studies up to about nine years ago. Since then, the use of mobile technology in primary and secondary education has increased tremendously, and numerous empirical studies have been conducted on this topic, but their conclusions were inconsistent. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review is to re-examine this issue by meta-analyzing the empirical research studies from the last nine years, with a focus on cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes in primary and secondary education, and to examine the potential moderators that may have contributed to the heterogeneity across findings. Methods: Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we found 85 studies of 78 peer-reviewed papers (N = 9157) from electronic databases and major journals in educational technology and mobile learning between 2014 and 2022. We then examined 15 moderators that were expected to affect student learning outcomes. Results and Conclusions: Compared with traditional technology and non-technology groups, using mobile technology produced medium positive and statistically significant effects on primary and secondary students' learning, in terms of cognitive (g = 0.498, 95% CI [0.382, 0.614]), affective (g = 0.449, 95% CI [0.301, 0.598]) and behavioural (g = 0.339, 95% CI [0.051, 0.627]) learning outcomes. Further moderator analyses revealed that student factors (i.e., community type, students' socioeconomic status), learning process (i.e., hardware used, student-to-hardware ratio, teaching method) and study quality (i.e., learning topic\/content equivalence, degree of technology use in the control group) were among the variables that moderated the summary effect sizes for at least one learning outcome dimension significantly.

We used cross-linguistic structural priming to potentially boost competition from the L1 grammar during the processing of wh-questions in English. For L1-German learners (Experiment 1), sentence-final interpretations showed effects of conflicting L1 parses in the greater number of misinterpretations of English subject as object wh-questions than vice versa. In a follow-up experiment with a comparison group of L1-Japanese learners (Experiment 2), we found the reverse pattern in sentence-final interpretations, with lower accuracy on English object than subject wh-questions. The asymmetry in comprehension accuracy between Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that the effect observed among L1-German learners reflected grammar competition from the L1 rather than general L2 effects. In both experiments, we observed cross-linguistic priming from L1 object questions to L2 object questions in on-line processing. Yet, cross-linguistic priming did not enhance competition from L1 object questions on L2 subject questions in Experiment 1 as reflected in comprehension accuracy or eye-gaze during processing. Together, these findings present evidence of cross-linguistic structural priming for equivalent interpretations (object-object), but indicate that priming does not extend to competing L1 interpretations of word-order equivalent structures cross-linguistically (object-subject). We suggest that interference from conflicting L1-based grammatical parses is narrowly delimited in intermediate to advanced L2 sentence processing.","subject":"Contrastive Linguistics, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Grammar, Priming, English (Second Language), Eye Movements, Native Language, Sentences, Language Processing, Questioning Techniques, German, Japanese, Language Proficiency, Language Tests, Vocabulary Skills, Undergraduate Students, Foreign Countries, Accuracy, Computer Assisted Testing","source":"Second Language Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Germany"},{"title":"Impact of the Technology-Enabled Learning at MIER","author":"Raj, Mool","description":"This report evaluates blended learning implementation at the Model Institute of Education and Research (MIER), J&amp;K, India.

Children (aged 7-11 years) played a computerized card game with virtual peers that resembles natural advanced lexical acquisition, during which new words are learned from child speakers and are produced actively in peer-group interactions. Successful word learning was predicted by the amount of input in regional and foreign accents but not by exposure to other languages (i.e., bilingualism).

Methods: Following the protocol of systematic review, this study selected 83 articles from four major research databases and analysed them from five interrelated aspects: instructional context, technological features, instructional design, research design, and instructional effect. A meta-analysis was also conducted to determine the overall effectiveness of panoramic video on education and the moderating factors. Results and Conclusions: The results revealed a rapid upward trend in publication since 2018 with unequal distribution among regions and learning domains. Despite the technical advancement in immersion and interaction, panoramic videos were found to mainly support the acquisition of content and factual knowledge through direct instruction, and lack in-video scaffolding and assessment. Moreover, many interventions were one-time, short-term studies that are susceptible of novelty effect. Lastly, an overall medium effect (g = 0.711) of panoramic video was reported and six significant moderating factors were identified based on the meta-analysis results.

Junior high school students may experience difficulty in mental representation when learning micro concepts, which leads to problems such as unsatisfactory academic performance and low learning motivation. Augmented reality (AR) is an optimal choice for presenting abstract concepts and invisible phenomena. Consequently, this study developed an AR application including three-layer experiential learning activities and integrating multiple external representations (text, pictures, 3D models, operations, etc.). To assess the effect of the AR application on students' knowledge gains, learning motivation, and technology perception, an experiment was conducted with 95 ninth-grade students aged 13-15\u00a0years who were randomly assigned to two groups (AR and non-AR). The results show that the AR application helped increase students' knowledge gains. Although there was no significant difference in the retention test between the two groups, scores on the transfer test were significantly higher for the AR group than for the non-AR group. Moreover, the AR application significantly improved students' motivation to learn. Finally, students had a positive perception of AR technology.","subject":"Chemistry, Science Instruction, Grade 9, Scientific Concepts, Concept Formation, Computer Simulation, Experiential Learning, Program Effectiveness, Knowledge Level, Student Motivation, Student Attitudes, Computer Attitudes","source":"Journal of Science Education and Technology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Effects of Flipped Reading-Writing Constructivist Instruction on EFL Learners&apos; Writing Performance and Intercultural Sensitivity","author":"Wu, Wen-Chi Vivian, Hsieh, Jun Chen, Yang, Jie Chi","description":"This mixed-methods research explored the affordances of a writing instruction featuring constructivist learning, reading-writing connection, flipped learning, and online intercultural exchanges with regard to English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners' writing performance and intercultural sensitivity.

The present research focused on physics learning in such times because conceptual and computational literacy in physics is critical to the development of a scientifically and technologically literate society. Objectives: The present research aimed (a) to offer an objective assessment of whether performance differences in a physics course of the general education curriculum existed between the face-to-face medium (familiar mode of instruction) and the online medium (unfamiliar mode of instruction) for both male and female students, and then (b) to develop a response to the evidence collected to ensure a quality education for all parties involved. The research intended to fill two critical gaps in the extant literature: mixed findings concerning students' performance in the face-to-face and online mediums as well as scarce coverage of specific domains of knowledge that are critical to STEM learners. Methods: Students' performance was examined as a function of the type of assessment (formative and summative), instructional mode (online and face-to-face), and gender. An understudied student population of STEM students of Middle Eastern descent without prior formal exposure to online instruction was targeted. Results and Conclusions: In both formative and summative assessments, male students performed better online than face-to-face, whereas the performance of female students was either higher online or equivalent between instructional mediums. The evidence collected suggested that consideration be given to remedies that foster academic success in the face-to-face instructional medium, particularly for male students. Takeaways: An evidence-based approach to learning dismantled emotion-driven expectations regarding the impact of the online medium on physics learning, and encouraged new perspectives about instruction.","subject":"COVID-19, Pandemics, Physics, Science Education, In Person Learning, Electronic Learning, Instructional Effectiveness, Gender Differences, Formative Evaluation, Summative Evaluation, STEM Education","source":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Enhancing Students&apos; Understanding of Nerve Cells&apos; Structures and Their Symbiotic Functioning by Using Technology-Enhanced Instruction Incorporating Virtual Labs and Animations","author":"Byukusenge, C\u00e9line, Nsanganwimana, Florien, Tarmo, Albert Paulo","description":"Some science subjects are often perceived to be difficult and boring by students due to their nature and the way they are taught. This study sought to check the effectiveness of the technology-enhanced instruction method with comprehensive use of virtual labs and animations in teaching nerve cells' (neurons and glial cells) structures and functions. Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning provided the theoretical model to frame the study. This study used a quasi-experimental design of pre-test and post-test where four secondary schools all from the southern province of Rwanda were selected from two different districts. Two schools from Ruhango District were assigned to the experimental group while the other two schools from Muhanga District were assigned to the control group. The study involved 168 students, 83 forming the control group, and 85 forming the experimental group. The biology test based on nerve cells was used to assess the effect of teaching strategies before and after learning. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 23, and we computed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA. The results indicated that the students who learned nerve cells by use of technology-enhanced instruction of virtual labs and animations outperformed those who learned with conventional methods (M. exp. = 80.41% with SD = 10.32 versus M. cont. = 47.11% with SD = 10.68 and a p-value &lt; 0.05). The results also indicated that after learning with virtual labs and animations, the number of students who were able to perform each of the 20 questions of the test increased considerably.

A key problem with software training is that video tutorials are developed without considering the target audience. Although video tutorials are popular, little attention is given to their design features. This study aims to investigate how two multimedia research principles, visual cueing (VC) and practice type, influence task performance, mental effort and motivation. Design\/methodology\/approach: Three video tutorials on non-linear editing were viewed by 118 Computer Science undergraduate students with high information communication technology experience. To analyse the relationships between the research variables, a 2 (non-VC versus VC) \u00d7 2 (post-video viewing practice versus stepwise viewing-based practice (SVBP) mixed factorial design was used. Findings: The results indicated that neither VC nor SVBP influenced task performance; however, both practice type conditions led to higher levels of motivation. Research limitations\/implications: The incorporation of VC and practice type in complex software training is less likely to be beneficial for domain experts. Future studies should record eye tracking data to capture learners' behaviours whilst learning a software application. Moreover, practice targeted with immediate feedback should be incorporated as it enhances scaffolding. Practical implications: Neither practice type was considered effective by experts. A practice strategy with user-controlled pausing (i.e. markers) could enhance retention by allowing users to practice tasks after locating the most relevant parts of the video tutorial.

Additionally, EFL students are not engaged in the writing process since they lack the required information about the writing tasks. Objectives: The present study, therefore, applied a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach to explore the impact of a flipped writing classroom on EFL students' writing skills (i.e. writing content, writing organization, and language use) and writing motivation on the one hand and possibly recommend a better instructional procedure for students' writing skills and writing motivation in EFL context on the other hand. Methods: To this aim, two intact classes were selected as the participants of the study. The two classes were randomly assigned to a flipped classroom with 27 EFL students and a non-flipped classroom with 24 EFL students. The non-flipped classroom was instructed through conventional writing instruction over 16 sessions whereas the flipped classroom was taught with the same content in a flipped writing mode in 10 sessions. Two timed writing tasks, a writing motivation scale, and an individual semi-structured interview were used to gather the required data. Results and Conclusions: The findings indicated that the flipped writing classroom outperformed the non-flipped writing classroom in improving the EFL students' writing performance, writing organization, language use, and writing motivation; however, no significant differences were found between the two groups' writing content.

ARG-based education as a form of student-centered learning situates students in a learning environment that integrates virtual elements with physical environments through three-dimensional pictures and videos on mobile devices for educational purposes. To connect the use of digital tools into the language classrooms and allow learners to view the real world, this study examined the viability of ARG-enhanced education on English foreign language (EFL) learners' learning of giving and asking for directions in flipped and blended contexts. The study involved 60 EFL elementary students of homogenous English proficiency, organized into two comparative and one control group, with 20 participants in each group. For the pre-test, an 18-item multiple-choice test with one written and oral question was administered to assess the learners' knowledge of asking for and giving directions. After taking the pre-test, the two comparative groups received 16 sessions of ARG-enhanced education (one with a blended and the other with a flipped classroom approach), while the control group received placebo instructions. The flipped group received the instructional materials preceding the online group, while the blended group received instruction in both online and face-to-face classes. The control group received instruction in a face-to-face context. After 8-weeks of treatment sessions, all participants of the study took the post-test.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to clarify the content of programming ability, to verify the effectiveness of ER as a teaching method to improve students' programming abilities and the conditions for more effective instructional design. Methods: The method of meta-analysis was adopted to conduct this study. 4180 K-12 students from 36 studies with a total of 85 effect sizes were captured. Based on the contents of included literature, an ER programming ability model was put forward, which was composed of essential ability and generative ability. The meta-analysis of essential ability (N = 22) and generative ability (N = 64) was carried out respectively. Results and conclusion: The results showed that ER activity has a positive effect on the essential ability (Hedges' g = 0.539 CI [0.327, 0.752], p &lt; 0.001) and generative ability (Hedges' g = 0.535 CI [0.426, 0.643], p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the results of moderator analysis showed that utilizing ER to solve mathematics problems is able to more effectively develop students' essential ability, while the STEM interdisciplinary ER instruction had the largest effect on generative ability. Simultaneously, the individual programming form is conducive to students' essential ability, while the generative ability is significantly affected by the cooperative programming form. No matter for the evaluation of essential ability or generative ability, ER had the greatest effect on kindergarten children' programming ability. Moreover, the intervention duration ranging from 1 to 5 weeks, the samples size less than 50 and the choice of measurement scale can effectively improve students' programming ability.

The use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) to extend field experiences has motivated several research groups to develop software integrating iVR techniques with tools to interpret and derive geological information from DOMs. This virtual approach can also contribute to the development of geological and spatial thinking skills taught in the classroom and during field trips. The immersive virtual field trips (iVFTs) can provide students access to outcrops and additional data restricted to field learning activities while allowing additional interactions impossible in the field. iVFTs have been developed recently; however, the structuring of iVFTs for geology classes has not been presented in a way that inexperienced iVR users can make use of such systems. In this scenario, our work proposes a method to structure an iVFT using georeferenced data containers and the virtual reality software Mosis LAB while evaluating users' perceptions during an iVFT study case. The evaluation using technology acceptance model questionnaires showed that users were positively impacted by the observational iVFT experience, effectively supporting e-learning, and class field learning activities and preparations.

One primary consideration for adapting a presentational speaking course to online delivery is how students will experience communication apprehension and\/or public speaking anxiety in online communication contexts. The instructional communication field is rife with research about students' experiences with speech anxiety and communication apprehension. However, little work has explored how students' experiences may differ when the primary mode of course communication and course presentations is mediated through either synchronous or asynchronous modes of online communication. If these anxieties in face-to-face settings can deter students' academic and professional goals (Richmond et al., &quot;Communication apprehension, avoidance, and effectiveness&quot; [6th ed., Pearson, 2013]), researchers should investigate students' experiences in online courses.

Twenty-five Grade 4-7 mathematics teachers from the Eastern Cape responded to two questionnaires given at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown period and during the phased return to school. Questions focused on the strategies used to support mathematics learning. The results show that strategies focused on engaging caregivers through various technologies and getting resources into the home.

However, much of the scientific information on YouTube is inaccurate. Prior studies have mostly focused on how students evaluate textual online information sources and have not yet systematically examined how they evaluate authentic scientific YouTube videos. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine how students evaluate authentic scientific YouTube videos in comparison to scientific webpages. Methods: Eighth grade students ranked six YouTube videos on the topic of climate change, justified their rankings, and responded to metacognitive prompts designed to elicit their evaluation criteria and strategies. Students also responded to a parallel webpage evaluation measure. We analysed and compared students' evaluation strategies and criteria. We also examined which evaluation criteria predict students' judgments of YouTube video quality. Results and Conclusions: Students predominantly relied on evaluation of video content, focusing mainly on criteria of communicative quality and explanation quality. Students tended to neglect source expertise and information validity criteria. Students evaluated videos mostly similarly to how they evaluated webpages. However, affective experiences played a greater role in video evaluation; whereas task relevance and verbal quality played a smaller role.

The method composed by synthesizing project-based and collaborative learning methods was named &quot;Newspaper Preparation Method,&quot; and the course was delivered using this method. Exploratory design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative techniques are both used, was applied in the study. The sample of the study consists of 35 undergraduate students studying in the primary mathematics education department. The quantitative data analyzed through SPSS-25 while qualitative data analyzed through content analysis. The results of data analysis revealed that the pre-service teachers held positive attitudes towards the method. Also, participants realized that they gained skills such as proactivity, research, inquiry, reproductivity, authorship, teamwork, and socializing. Besides, pre-service teachers' prejudices were eliminated against the course, their motivation increased, their curiosity was triggered, and most importantly the pre-service teachers deemed themselves important. Moreover, this method has transformed the course from a boring program into an exciting and enjoyable part of the syllabus. Finally, pre-service teachers stated that they learned the class effectively and permanently, their vocabulary and general knowledge increased, and their computer literacy improved. It is predicted that this study will contribute to the literature through analyzing a hands-on method and inspire those teaching the history of mathematics.","subject":"Mathematics Instruction, Teaching Methods, College Mathematics, Undergraduate Students, Mathematics Education, Instructional Innovation, Cooperative Learning, Preservice Teachers, Preservice Teacher Education, Student Attitudes, Positive Attitudes, Attitude Change, Achievement Gains, Computer Literacy, History","source":"International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Incorporating Teacher Intelligence into Digital Games: An Expert System-Guided Self-Regulated Learning Approach to Promoting EFL Students&apos; Performance in Digital Gaming Contexts","author":"Chu, Shih-Ting, Hwang, Gwo-Jen, Chien, Shu-Yun, Chang, Shao-Chen","description":"In recent years, several studies have reported the potential of employing digital games in EFL (English as Foreign Language) courses to promote students' learning motivation. However, scholars have pointed out that students generally lack self-learning ability, which is the key to the success of learning a foreign language. Therefore, it is crucial to foster students' self-learning ability during the game-based learning process. In this study, an expert system was developed to facilitate self-regulated learning in digital game-based learning contexts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was employed in a university English course. The experimental group students learned with the self-regulated English vocabulary game (SR-EVG) approach, while the control group students learned with the conventional English vocabulary game (C-EVG) approach. The experimental results indicated that the use of the SR-EVG approach could improve learners' English vocabulary achievement and self-regulation compared with the C-EVG approach without increasing students' English learning anxiety. Moreover, through qualitative interviews, it was found that students who used the SR-EVG approach would focus on their learning due to goal-setting in the game and would pay more attention to the learning strategies they used.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computer Games, Vocabulary Development, Metacognition, Learning Motivation, Independent Study, Game Based Learning, Comparative Analysis, College Students, Achievement Gains, Goal Orientation, Student Attitudes, Conventional Instruction","source":"British Journal of Educational Technology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Relevant Mathematical Modelling Efforts for Understanding COVID-19 Dynamics: An Educational Challenge","author":"Meyer, J.

The mathematical tools that are used derive from nonlinear systems of difference equations (possibly viable at a high school level, using spreadsheets or adequate software) as well as nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations (therefore using mathematical tools and software well within the reach of undergraduate students of many courses). This purpose is accomplished by motivating students and learners to study existing SIR-type models and modifying them in order to have a fully understandable translation of dynamics for infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in several different realistic scenarios, that is to say, situations that consider social distancing policies, widespread vaccination programmes, as well as possible and even probable results when in the presence of negationist postures and attitudes. Several modelling choices referring to real-life situations are shown and explored. These models are analysed and discussed, implicitly proposing similar attitudes and evaluations in learning environments. Conclusions are drawn, stimulating further work using the described mathematical tools and resources.","subject":"Mathematical Models, COVID-19, Pandemics, Equations (Mathematics), College Mathematics, Secondary School Mathematics, Computer Software, Health Behavior, Mathematics Instruction, Mathematics Education","source":"ZDM: Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Learning English with Electronic Textbooks on Mobile Devices: Impacts on University Students&apos; Vocabulary Development","author":"Xodabande, Ismail, Hashemi, Mohammad R.","description":"The current study examined the use of electronic textbooks designed as mobile applications for learning vocabulary in English among Iranian university students. To this end, 95 university students in an experimental (N = 50) and a control group (N = 45) participated in the study. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was employed and over an academic semester, the participants used either traditional materials or mobile-based electronic textbooks for learning 600 words in English. To assess the outcomes from different learning conditions, receptive knowledge of the target vocabulary items was tested in three junctures of time (i.e. pre-, post-, and delayed post-test). Additionally, open-ended questionnaires and interviews were used to collect qualitative data from the experimental group to further investigate their perceptions of using mobile-based electronic textbooks for vocabulary learning. The findings revealed a significant main effect for time and both groups significantly improved their vocabulary knowledge from pre-test to post-test. Moreover, a significant main effect was found for using electronic textbooks on mobile devices, and the experimental group outperformed the control group on the post- and delayed post-tests. The qualitative findings revealed three perceived benefits, namely &quot;episodic learning,&quot; &quot;easy access to materials,&quot; and &quot;enhanced enjoyment&quot; for mobile assisted vocabulary learning through electronic textbooks. The perceived challenges were related to &quot;health concerns,&quot; &quot;distractions associated with mobile environments,&quot; and &quot;external pressure resulting from excessive mobile use&quot; among the participants.

Yet literacy is a fluid, deictic term, the meaning of which is context dependent, and digital literacies need to be defined and conceptualised within a specific context. Recent CALL literature highlights the interest in CDL from various perspectives, but how CDL is conceptualised by the VE participants themselves is not explored. Participants of this study were 37 trainee English language teachers in the UK and Turkey who joined a 6-week VE. Their ongoing reflections on CDL were captured through reflective e-portfolio entries following each VE task. Thematic analysis revealed four components of CDL in this specific VE: (1) participants' awareness of digital affordances for &quot;self-expression,&quot; (2) semiotic and interactional means to &quot;build connections,&quot; (3) ensuring &quot;inclusiveness&quot; of all community members, and (4) implications of &quot;socio-political contexts&quot; of each participant for meaning-making and interaction. We conclude that in future pedagogical implementations of VE, facilitators can foster trainee teachers' CDL development through more closely guided and informed reflection on the four themes presented in this paper. As such, this study makes a novel contribution to our understanding of CDL in VE settings for ELT teacher education by offering a social semiotic second language acquisition orientation within an interpretivist paradigm.","subject":"Critical Literacy, Digital Literacy, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Teacher Education, Computer Mediated Communication, Teaching Methods, Foreign Countries, International Programs, Cooperative Learning, Preservice Teachers","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom, Turkey"},{"title":"Integration of Virtual Microscopy Podcasts in the Histology Discipline in Osteopathic Medical School: Learning Outcomes","author":"Sakthi-Velavan, Sumathilatha, Zahl, Sarah","description":"Virtual microscopy podcasts (VMPs) are narrative recordings of digital histology images. This study evaluated the outcomes of integrating the VMPs into teaching histology to osteopathic medical students. The hypothesis was that incorporating virtual microscopy podcasts as supplementary histology resources to the curriculum would have a positive impact on student performance and satisfaction. Sixty-one podcasts of dynamic microscopic images were created using screen recordings of the digital slides. The VMPs were integrated as supplementary histology resources in multiple courses during the first and second years of the medical curriculum for three classes, a total of 477 osteopathic medical students. A voluntary and anonymous survey was obtained from the students using a questionnaire that included two open-ended questions. The overall performance of the three classes on the histology content of the preclinical course examinations was compared to historical controls of the previous two classes that did not have access to the VMPs. Most students indicated that the podcasts enabled more efficient study time and improved their confidence in the histology content on examinations. The findings indicated a positive association between podcast viewing and efficient study time utilization and class performance. The class average scores of the three consecutive cohorts that used the VMPs progressively increased by 7.69%, 14.88%, and 14.91% compared to the controls.

Integer arithmetic (i.e., calculations with negative numbers) is a difficult topic that is crucial for later mathematics. Thus, this study synthesized multiple theoretical perspectives to understand students' experiences playing games during an integer unit. A mixed methods design study was conducted to answer the primary question: How was student experience (motivation to learn and engagement) related to game features? Student perspectives about the three integer games they played and observations of student engagement during gameplay were analyzed using perspectives from game design and the Cognitive Demand framework for mathematical tasks. Overall, students positively perceived playing games, however, individuals' motivation and engagement varied in relation to game features. Students provided valuable insights for research and practice as to which game features were engaging or motivating and why. Speed-based synchronous games that exclusively used skill, rather than a chance-skill balance induced stress and decreased motivation for many students. Thus, a critical implication was to first do no harm by selecting or designing classroom games that have features of turn-taking and chance.

This review article looks at both Online Informal Language Learning and non-formal learning activities relevant to SA, with particular focus on the Erasmus + online learning support (OLS) platform and popular commercial non-formal learning apps such as Duolingo and Busuu. Such informal and non-formal learning activities also interact with formal language learning offered to SA students, some of which may also take place online. Formal, non-formal and informal learning can therefore be seen to constitute a personal learning environment (PLE) which is specific to each learner. Complex systems views of language learning, including usage based approaches and cognitive grammar, form a useful theoretical framework for understanding how second language (L2) skills may develop as learners are exposed to frequently occurring prototypes in salient contexts in input. While it is now widely accepted that such exposure has a significant impact on comprehension levels, research continues into individual differences between learners in terms of exposure time and cognitive, affective and linguistic engagement with the target materials. Data will be presented indicating that while formal and non-formal learning activities involve exposure times which are often insufficient for significant language development when taken in isolation, informal learning activities offer exposure times and forms of engagement which support language development for many learners.

We found that linguistic similarity within and between the threaded discussions was significantly varied, revealing the dynamic and unconstrained nature of the discourse. Further, word choice moderately predicted linguistic similarity between posts within threaded discussions (accuracy = 0.73; F1-score = 0.67), revealing that discourse participants' lexical choices effectively discriminate between posts in terms of similarity.

Researchers have investigated virtual learning for students with disabilities and have made recommendations including supplemental online resources for individualization and incorporating what we know works for students with disabilities, such as explicit instruction and assistive technology. Another recommendation for virtual learning, and the focus of this article, is the use of scaffolding. Since we know scaffolding is a high-leverage practice for students with disabilities, we can take what we know about scaffolding in face-to-face instruction and transform it to work in virtual settings. This article offers vignettes of a science classroom as two teachers plan for scaffolded instruction to support reading, which is critical in science learning.","subject":"Special Education, Web Based Instruction, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Students with Disabilities, Electronic Learning, Distance Education, COVID-19, Pandemics, Individualized Instruction, Direct Instruction, Assistive Technology, Science Instruction, Reading Instruction, Science Education, Barriers, Reading Comprehension","source":"Journal of Special Education Technology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Shared Reading and Science Vocabulary for Kindergarten Students","author":"Gibbs, Anna S., Reed, Deborah K.","description":"Kindergarten students commonly receive a limited amount of exposure to scientific concepts and informational texts. The present study used a multiple probe design across participants to determine the effects of shared reading instruction on three kindergarten students' science-related vocabulary acquisition in a virtual classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interventionist delivered explicit vocabulary instruction by reading aloud a science picture book and intentionally pausing to define, explain, and discuss vocabulary words that were unfamiliar to young students. Researcher-developed vocabulary probes were administered every fifth instructional session and measured specific words taught during instruction. Results of virtual shared reading instruction indicate positive effects (Tau-U = 0.222-0.933) on kindergarten students' science vocabulary learning. Students, their instructor, and caregivers all perceived the shared reading instruction as beneficial for science vocabulary development. These findings suggest explicit science vocabulary instruction during shared reading is beneficial to students and feasible for teachers to implement in a virtual classroom.","subject":"Reading Instruction, Science Instruction, Vocabulary Development, Kindergarten, Young Children, Virtual Classrooms, COVID-19, Pandemics, Reading Aloud to Others","source":"Early Childhood Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Influence of Blended Instruction on Students&apos; Learning Effectiveness: The Role of Flow","author":"Tang, Qing, Zhang, Tao, Jiang, Lixia","description":"The rapid development and extensive application of information and communication technologies has facilitated blended instruction, which is regarded as the &quot;new normal&quot; in the field of modern education and has become the focus of academic research.

The research question addresses how D[superscript 3] can be used to develop primary teachers' knowledge about teaching science with digital technologies. Design\/methodology\/approach: During two semesters, 14 primary science teachers from three different schools participated in an in-service course at the university. Five D[superscript 3] workshops lasting 4 h each were conducted with the aim to analyze, design and implement digital tools based on the needs of teachers and students. This includes discussions about the technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework and further recommendations about how to choose, design, implement and evaluate digital tools for different teaching and learning situations. In between the workshops, the teachers were told to reflect on their experiences with colleagues and students and share their ideas and reflections to support collegial learning. Findings: The results indicate that D[superscript 3] has an opportunity to promote deep learning experiences with a framework that encourages teachers and researchers to study, explore and analyze the applied designs-in-practice, where teachers take part in the design process. This study further indicates that having teachers explicitly articulates their reasoning about designing digital applications to engage students' learning that seems important for exploring the types of knowledge used in these design practices and reflecting on aspects of their teaching with digital technologies likely to influence their TPACK. Research limitations\/implications: This research indicates that the increasing prevalence of information communication technology offers challenges and opportunities to the teaching and learning of science and to the scientific practice teachers might encounter. It offers solutions by investigating how primary teachers can design their own digital technology to meet students' science learning needs. One limitation might be that the group of 14 teachers cannot be generalized to represent all teachers. However, this study gives implications for how to work with and for teachers to develop their knowledge of digital technologies in teaching. Practical implications: As this project shows teachers can take an active part in the digital school development and as such become producer of knowledge and ideas and not only become consumers in the jungle of technical applications that are implemented on a school level. Therefore, it might well be argued that in science teaching, paying more careful attention to how teachers and researchers work together in collaborative settings, offers one way of better valuing science teachers' professional knowledge of practice. As such, an implication is that digital applications are not made &quot;for&quot; teachers but instead &quot;with&quot; and &quot;by&quot; teachers. Social implications: The society puts high demands om teachers' knowledge and competencies to integrate digital technologies into their daily practices. Building on teachers' own needs and concerns, this project addresses the challenge for teachers as a community to be better prepared for and meet the societal challenge that digitalization means for schools. Originality\/value: Across the field of science education, knowledge about the relation between teachers' use of digital technology and how it might (or might not) promote students' learning offers access to ideas of how to design and implement teacher professional development programs. This offers enhanced communication opportunities between schools and universities regarding school facilities and expectations of technology to improve teachers' experiences with integrating technology into their learning and teaching. This pragmatic approach to research creates theory and interventions that serve school practice but also produces challenges for design-based researchers.","subject":"Instructional Design, Teaching Methods, Learning Processes, Technological Literacy, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Teacher Attitudes, Information Technology, Science Teachers, Elementary School Students, Decision Making, Teacher Workshops, Collegiality, Faculty Development, Learning Experience, Guidelines, Science Instruction, Student Needs, Technology Integration, Computer Software","source":"Interactive Technology and Smart Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"An Attitudinal Study of 5th-Grade Teachers&apos; Perceptions about Mathematics and the Influence on Instruction","author":"Knight, Margaret","description":"Research suggests that math anxiety correlates directly with individuals' views of mathematics-related experiences. Research also suggests that math anxiety may begin in early elementary grades and remain into adulthood. This study examined how teachers' experiences, perceptions, and mathematics confidence levels influence mathematics instruction. To understand teachers' perceptions of mathematics, the researcher used a qualitative phenomenological approach to probe into their earliest memories of mathematics before entering school and their experiences during formal education. Seven 5th-grade teachers with two to fourteen years of experience agreed to participate in the study. The participants responded to ten open-ended questions focused on mathematics instruction and seven interview questions examining participants 'experiences with mathematics. The researcher also observed mathematics instruction in each teacher's classroom. The results indicated that teachers recalled fond early memories of mathematics and felt reasonably confident about their math instruction. Some teachers struggled with mathematics as elementary students, while others excelled. The majority of participants completed the basic requirements for mathematics in high school. Most teachers did not engage in a mathematics methods course focused on standards-based elementary mathematics. Teachers' weak areas in mathematics corresponded with similar studies regarding complex mathematics topics. Several key components of mathematics instruction were absent during observations. Future research may need to increase the number of observations and the sample size.","subject":"Grade 5, Mathematics Anxiety, Correlation, Elementary School Teachers, Teacher Attitudes, Self Efficacy, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Phenomenology, Educational Experience, Learning Experience, Lesson Plans, Mathematics Achievement","source":"Online Submission","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"South Carolina"},{"title":"A Synthesis of Professional Development Targeting Literacy Instruction and Intervention for English Learners","author":"Shelton, Alexandra, Hogan, Erin, Chow, Jason, Wexler, Jade","description":"An important way to address the literacy needs of English learners (ELs) is to ensure that ELs receive evidence-based literacy instruction and intervention.

This report is the first effort to build a national picture of state-, district-, and school-provided infrastructure specifically for social studies instruction and also the first to provide national estimates of what social studies curriculum materials elementary teachers regularly use for their instruction. The infrastructure examined is much less robust for social studies than for other core academic subjects, especially at the elementary level. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence showing that social studies instruction is underrepresented in the U.S. education system. The findings imply that improvements to social studies teaching and learning require much more than piecemeal efforts.

The authors share real-world examples from the classrooms of ESOL teachers, unpack the teachers' thinking about their instruction, and identify six core practices that are foundational to teaching multilingual students: knowing your multilingual students, building a positive learning environment, integrating content and language instruction, supporting language and literacy development, using assessment, and developing positive relationships and engaging in advocacy. The book focuses on how K-12 teachers can use these core practices in ways that humanize their instruction--positioning students as whole human beings, valuing the assets and resources they bring to the classroom, actively involving them in rigorous instruction that draws on their experiences and knowledge, responding to each unique learning context, and disrupting traditional power dynamics in education. This text will help pre- and inservice teachers of multilingual students to center equity and justice in their practice and understand how to move humanizing mindsets into action. The book features: (1) Identifies and describes core practices for teaching multilingual students; (2) Offers opportunities to analyze teachers' instruction using core practices; (3) Includes templates and additional resources that help teachers extend the use of core practices to their own planning; (4) Supports teacher educators in preparing teachers to move humanizing mindsets to humanizing practices; and (5) Provides access to supplementary video clips depicting teachers as they engage in these practices and discuss their use.[Foreword by Christian J.

In this study, we employed a one-group, pretest-posttest design to evaluate whether 41 struggling primary grade writers who attended a university-based summer learning program would increase in writing ability, given a commercially available process writing unit differentiated to provide more support. A Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) unit was modified for use in the program: The content was streamlined, the volume of writing was reduced, the instructional explicitness was strengthened, increased feedback and student product goals were integrated, and the instruction was small group. We analyzed the data by students' entering level of intervention need (i.e., Tier 3, Tier 2) as determined by Written Expression Curriculum-Based Measurement (WE-CBM) Correct Writing Sequences (CWS) scores. Students who entered at Tier 2 level (N = 8) showed significant mean gains on the TCRWP On-Demand Performance Assessment and CWS assessment. Their pretest and posttest Test of Early Written Language-3 (TEWL-3) scores were comparable. Students who entered at Tier 3 level (N = 33) showed significant mean gains on all assessments. Analyses of progress relative to CWS end-of-year performance targets revealed five of eight Tier 2 students scored within Tier 1 at posttest. Three continued to score within Tier 2.

Many empirical studies in this area have yet to elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from 2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized programming and student-centered instructional approaches were facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover, CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2) applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3) generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12 contexts.","subject":"Computation, Thinking Skills, Mathematics Skills, Mathematics Education, Elementary Secondary Education, Mathematics Instruction, Teaching Methods, Student Centered Learning, Geometry, Mathematical Logic","source":"International Journal of STEM Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Exploring Primary Grades Teachers&apos; Perceptions of Their Students&apos; Mathematics Self-Efficacy and How They Differentiate Instruction","author":"McNeill, Hayley, Polly, Drew","description":"The purpose of this basic, exploratory study is to examine primary grades (K-2) teachers' perceptions of the self-efficacy of their students in mathematics, whether or not there is a difference in the self-efficacy between students based on their performance, and to\u00a0gather information about how teachers are differentiating instruction.

However, there are only a few studies that have shed empirical evidence on the relationship of attitudes and inclusive teaching approaches, such as differentiated instruction. In this vein, the present study tackles this research gap and aims to explore teachers' attitudes specifically towards the inclusive practice of DI in Germany. Aims: The present study aimed to investigate teacher profiles based on their attitudes towards differentiated instruction, as well as further to explore whether teachers differentiated instructional implementation varies between the teacher profiles. Sample: The sample consists of 450 teachers (M[subscript age] = 42.89, SD = 10.48, 65% female), from different school tracks in Germany. Methods A two-step cluster analysis was performed in order to identify teacher attitude profiles concerning their implementation of differentiated instruction. Moreover, an analysis of variance was conducted in order to identify variations in terms of the implementation of differentiated instruction across the three clusters. Results: Results from the cluster analyses indicate three distinct teacher attitude profiles: Cluster 1 'The valuing-teacher', Cluster 2 'The non-valuing-teacher' and Cluster 3 'The challenged-but-valuing-teacher'. Moreover, the findings reveal gender and school track differences between the three teacher attitude profiles. Lastly, an analysis of variance indicated that teachers' differentiated instruction practice varied significantly across the clusters. Conclusions: The findings from the present study indicate that teachers not only perceive the value of DI but also the insufficient resources. Thus, it can be assumed that teachers identify both the 'positive' and the 'negative' aspect of DI, and more importantly, they can recognize both attitude domains towards DI in a similar or different level. Consequently, the results show that attitudes in the context of inclusion cannot be characterised as continuum with two distinct poles.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Teacher Attitudes, Individualized Instruction, Inclusion, Gender Differences, Teacher Characteristics, Secondary School Teachers","source":"British Journal of Educational Psychology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Germany"},{"title":"EFL Literacy Instruction as Reflected in Elementary School Textbooks in Israel","author":"Fuchs, Stephanie, Katzir, Tami, Kahn-Horwitz, Janina","description":"Israel is one of many countries in which English is not the spoken language.

The association between mindsets and academic achievement has been examined in different academic subjects, such as biology and math. However, no previous study has examined the effects of language learning mindsets (LLMs) and math mindsets (MMs) on academic success in an English medium instruction (EMI) setting in which English, rather than the first language of the students, is used for teaching content (e.g., mechatronics engineering). Purpose\/Hypothesis: This study explores the relationship between Turkish mechatronics engineering undergraduate students' domain-specific mindsets, LLMs and MMs, and their academic success. Design\/Method: Student test scores for English medium and first-language medium courses were collected from fourth-year students studying mechatronics engineering (n = 68) at a public university in Turkey. Students also completed the LLM and MM inventories. Results: Regression analyses revealed that growth LLM and MM were positive predictors of EMI and Turkish medium of instruction (TMI) academic success, whereas fixed LLM and MM were negative predictors of EMI and TMI academic success. Conclusions: In both EMI and TMI courses, a growth mindset in math and language learning can profoundly predict students' academic achievement in a mechatronics engineering program. We argue that domain-specific mindsets can effectively explain the self-theories of intelligence and achievement.","subject":"Engineering Education, Language of Instruction, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Self Concept, Academic Achievement, Academic Ability, Correlation, Mathematics Skills, Undergraduate Students, Student Attitudes, Scores, State Universities, Predictor Variables, Foreign Countries, Intellectual Development","source":"Journal of Engineering Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"Trust in Principals, Leaders&apos; Focus on Instruction, Teacher Collaboration, and Teacher Self-Efficacy: Testing a Multilevel Mediation Model","author":"\u00c7oban, \u00d6m\u00fcr, \u00d6zdemir, Nedim, Bellibas, Mehmet S\u00fckr\u00fc","description":"A vast amount of contemporary research has been devoted to defining effective school leadership roles and practices and measuring their influence on school processes, structures and outcomes. This paper examines the effects of trust in principals and school leaders' focus on instruction on teacher collaboration and teacher self-efficacy. Using teacher survey data collected from 45 lower secondary Turkish schools across the country in the 2018-2019 academic year, this study employs multilevel structural equation modelling with Bayesian estimation to investigate the structural relationships between trust in principals, alongside leaders' focus on instruction, and teacher collaboration and teacher self-efficacy. The study confirms previous research, indicating that trust in principals has a crucial role in teachers' emphasis on instruction and that these principals' instructional leadership practices enhance teachers' sense of efficacy both directly and indirectly through teacher collaboration. The research concludes that, while the way these practices are carried out might differ across contexts, the principals' leadership practices focusing on teaching and learning still matter for teachers' beliefs and practices in non-western countries.

The data presented is from a more in-depth study completed during the 2017-2018 academic year. Few studies have implemented think-aloud in evaluating deaf adolescents' reading challenges and the efficacy of strategy use. This study provided insight into both of these issues. Results show an increase in the variety of strategies used by students and frequency of strategy use post-intervention. Results also indicate improved comprehension scores for two students. Close examination of the data, however, reveals ongoing metacognitive challenges (such as lack of consistent identification of key unknown words and lack of awareness of comprehension breakdowns) and inconsistency in the efficacious use of strategies.

These students often experience widespread and persistent reading comprehension challenges. A systematic review and meta-analysis, anchored in a construction-integration model of reading comprehension, was undertaken to examine single-subject research design (SSRD) and group design studies aimed at remediating reading comprehension challenges in students with ASD. Reading comprehension instruction was operationalized by surface, textbase, and situation model levels. Random effect modeling with robust standard error estimations suggested small yet statistically significant intervention effects. Situation model-level interventions demonstrated the highest intervention effects in group design studies. Across designs, retelling and curriculum-based question-answering measures demonstrated larger effect sizes than cloze and norm-referenced measures. Methodological quality analysis suggested that few individual SSRD and group studies had high design quality with large intervention effects. We concluded that reading comprehension instruction focused on the situation model level should be prioritized for students with ASD, and future studies should reduce bias in designing intervention studies.","subject":"Autism Spectrum Disorders, Students with Disabilities, Reading Difficulties, Reading Comprehension, Reading Instruction, Teaching Methods, Intervention, Instructional Effectiveness","source":"Reading Research Quarterly","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Instructional Quality of Two Beginning Mathematics Teachers for Three Years: What Professional Competency Makes a Difference?","author":"Park, Mimi, Kim, Yeon","description":"Mathematics teaching is challenging particularly for teachers who have just started their careers. Research on this sort of teacher has focused separately on their knowledge, identity, or instructional quality. Yet, teaching mathematics as a profession requires synthetic and comprehensive competency. To fill this gap, this study investigates the relationship between changes in instructional quality and professional competency for teaching mathematics in terms of knowledge, skills, and identity. The current study recruited two beginning mathematics teachers who had the same teacher education backgrounds and worked at the same high school. We collected and analyzed video and audio recordings of their instruction and meetings and interviews about instruction. The findings reveal how their instructional quality changed during the first 3\u00a0years of teaching in addition to their heterogeneous professional competency for teaching mathematics. While both had high levels of mathematical knowledge for teaching, they differed in the extent of their skills for ambitious teaching and identity concerning mathematics instruction. Based on the findings, we argue that teacher education needs to value all aspects for professional competency synthetically, for indeed possessing mathematical knowledge alone is insufficient for a high quality of instruction. We also discuss approaches in teacher education about skills and identity for teaching mathematics.","subject":"Educational Quality, Instructional Effectiveness, Beginning Teachers, Mathematics Teachers, Teacher Competencies, High School Teachers, Knowledge Level, Teaching Skills, Professional Identity","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Re-Thinking the Online Distance Instruction Based on Students&apos; Feedback","author":"Simonova, Ivana, Faltynkova, Ludmila, Kostolanyova, Katerina, Klimszova, Slavomira","description":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools at all levels were often closed and online distance instruction (ODI) was applied. The main objective of this research was to discover the main didactic features of online distance instruction; and based on the collected data to define didactic recommendations towards improving the quality of the process. Five hypotheses were set that evaluated students' opinions in the areas of teachers' support for learners within ODI, types of sources exploited within ODI, means used for practising and fixing new knowledge within ODI, assessment of learners' performance within ODI, and students' feedback on ODI. In total, 272 respondents from upper secondary and higher education institutions participated in the research. Each respondent described the process of online distance instruction in two courses they selected of 64: (1) in a course that they appreciated, liked, enjoyed, and considered efficient from the point of view of their learning; (2) in a course that caused them discomfort in learning, as it was conducted in a way that did not suit them, and their learning did not bring the expected learning outcomes. Data were collected via a questionnaire; Ch\u00ed-square test, adjusted residuals, and t test for comparison of means were calculated. Before the research started, teachers were trained in online distance instruction.

Administration and language teachers disagree on what needs to be improved in a changing societal environment. Professional pride and appreciation are strongly demanded in a profession that is still being established, and challenges specific to adult education translate into priorities in delivering instruction. In the German setting, expressions culminate in prerequisites, and challenges lie in the way external factors influence course design and instruction.

Methods: Students completed an activity either before or after instruction (explore-first or instruct-first conditions). In Experiment 1, the activity included contrasting cases; in Experiment 2, the activity instead included a rich dataset. Students completed a post-test assessing procedural knowledge, conceptual knowledge and transfer. Results: In Experiment 1, students in the explore-first condition demonstrated similar procedural knowledge, higher conceptual knowledge and higher transfer than students in the instruct-first condition. In Experiment 2, there were no significant differences in learning outcomes between explore-first and instruct-first conditions.

Drawing on extensive and current research, the authors show how secondary educators can use students' own language and lived experiences, coupled with authentic science practices, to provide rich and relevant language support. Using a science unit as a shared text, readers will learn how to gather rich knowledge about emergent bilinguals, unpack the ideas and language demands of Next Generation Science Standards, strategically embed language and literacy standards in the curriculum, and sequence learning activities around an anchoring phenomenon, a text, and an assessment. In the process, readers will come away with a repertoire of planning tools and examples of how to support emergent bilinguals in using language to collaborate with others and to interpret and produce texts that are central to learning and doing science. &quot;Planning Science Instruction for Emergent Bilinguals&quot; blends theory and practice so readers understand both how and why this planning process can be used to disrupt social inequity for emergent bilinguals.

However, whilst the notion of DI is not new, studies on the effectiveness of DI with respect to student outcomes remain relatively unclear. This may be due partly to the operationalization of DI as well as the narrow focus of many studies on academic performance, thus neglecting other pertinent student outcomes. To address this, the current study aims to examine the impact of a specific DI strategy, namely differentiating according to readiness level and student interest, on intrinsic motivation and perceived competence. Two classes of Primary Six (Year 6 equivalent) students participated in the study, of which one class was pre-classified as high readiness, whilst the other class was pre-classified as low readiness. The research design followed a quasi-experimental single group pre-post-test design and took place in English language classes over a period of five lessons. Results indicated that there was an increase in the level of students' intrinsic motivation and perceived competence in both classes. However, there were no differences in the impact between students with high and low readiness levels. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a specific DI strategy on intrinsic motivation and perceived competence.","subject":"Individualized Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness, Readiness, Student Interests, Student Motivation, Self Concept, Competence, Elementary School Students, Grade 6, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction","source":"Educational Research for Policy and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Evaluating the Rationale and Evidence Supporting Executive Functions Skills Instruction in the Classroom: A Critical Review","author":"D'Intino, Joseph","description":"Executive functions are widely considered as an umbrella term for the higher order cognitive processes that contribute to goal-directed behavior.

To promote the development of executive functions among youth within educational settings, some theorists and clinicians have proposed methods of explicitly instructing executive functioning skills, such as planning, organization, time management, and self-regulation skills. This critical review serves to evaluate the theoretical rationale and the supporting evidence of the six most cited handbooks for improving executive functions skills among elementary and high school students via class-wide instruction. Research that cited these handbooks and that addressed whole-class instruction of executive skills was evaluated and critiqued according to the four levels of the Every Students Succeeds Act. The overall evidence supporting each handbook was then critiqued as lacking, emerging, or sufficient. Although the handbooks are informed by theory and clinical experience, the supporting research is limited to mostly Level 3 and 4 evidence, as defined by the ESSA framework, including only a handful of case studies and small sampled quasi-experimental studies. Overall, the evidence supporting the explicit instruction of executive functioning skills through a class-wide approach is lacking and more rigorous research is still required.

While promoted as a recent innovation, the repurposing of science instruction to improve the health of demographic groups has a longer history traceable to segregated and colonial schooling. Using a historicizing approach, this study explores how certain U.S. science classrooms have become clinics of preventative care aimed at transforming groups into healthy citizens. Analysis identifies how U.S. science education studies have used psychological, sociological, and anthropological lenses to divide students into populations, classifying some as needing intervention to improve their minds (e.g., basic health knowledge), home lives (e.g., daily habits), and cultural beliefs (e.g., attitudes toward science and medicine). Through systematic analysis of U.S. science education journals and sources cited therein, I map shifts over three periods: the rise of urban, segregated, and colonial schooling (1901-45), postwar desegregation and international development (1946-89), and equity reforms (1990-2021). Despite declines in deficit language, analysis suggests the intervention space of the science-class-as-clinic still demarcates groups as not yet fully reasoning, self-regulating, or agentic, and as needing the applied relevance of preventative health. Paradoxically, efforts to redress disparities may reinsert older distinctions by positing groups as educationally and medically at-risk--implicitly locating inequities within students rather than the unjust systemic conditions they face. I conclude with implications for research and practice, highlighting approaches that do not treat educational and health inequities as problems to be fixed in the child, family, or community.","subject":"Science Instruction, Minority Group Students, Prevention, Health Promotion, At Risk Students, Educational History, Urban Schools, School Segregation, Colonialism, School Desegregation, Equal Education, Educational Change, Access to Health Care","source":"Science Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Representation of Science and Engineering Practices and Design Skills in Engineering Design-Integrated Science Units Developed by Pre-Service Teachers","author":"Mumba, Frackson, Rutt, Alexis, Chabalengula, Vivien Mweene","description":"The current US science education reforms call for integrating engineering design in science instruction requires teachers to develop and teach engineering design-integrated science (EDIS) lessons. However, very few teachers have received training in engineering and how to integrate engineering design into science lessons. In response to this challenge, our teacher education program has been training secondary pre-service science teachers in engineering design and how to develop EDIS instructional materials. Thus, this study reports on the representation of science and engineering practices and engineering design skills in the EDIS instructional units developed by participant pre-service teachers, in aggregate and by science discipline and by different sections within the units. Results show that all science and engineering practices and design skills were included in the units. However, engineering practices and design skills were covered more than science practices in the EDIS instructional units.

In doing so, a sample of 67 first-year students took part in a study with a non-equivalent control group pretest--posttest design. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: one receiving explicit information without further exercises (EI group), another receiving structured input activities comprising both referential and affective activities without explicit information (SI group), and the third group receiving processing instruction containing both explicit information and structured input activities (PI group). First, Ehrman and Leaver's (E &amp; L) Construct questionnaire was employed to categorize the participants into ectenic and synoptic learners in each group. Afterward, a General Language Proficiency Test (GLPT) and a Target Structure Test were administered. After the treatment, the learners took a posttest modeling the pretest. The independent samples t-tests run in each group revealed no significant differences between the ectenic and synoptic learners' performance regarding the components of PI. However, the findings suggested that the ectenic learners benefited least from the SI activities, and the advantageous effect of PI was mainly related to EI.

Specifically, using administrative data from the school district, we investigated to what extent students made gains in reading during the 2020-2021 school year relative to the pre-COVID-19 typical school year in 2018-2019. We further examined whether the effects of students' instructional modality on reading growth varied by demographic characteristics. Overall, students had lower average reading achievement gains over the 9-month 2020-2021 school year than the 2018-2019 school year with a learning loss effect size of 0.54, 0.27, and 0.28 standard deviation unit for Grade 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Substantially reduced reading gains were observed from Grade 3 students, students from high-poverty backgrounds, English learners, and students with disabilities. Additionally, findings indicate that among students with similar demographic characteristics, higher-achieving students tended to choose the fully remote instruction option, while lower-achieving students appeared to opt for in-person instruction at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year. However, students who received in-person instruction most likely demonstrated continuous growth in reading over the school year, whereas initially higher-achieving students who received remote instruction showed stagnation or decline, particularly in the spring 2021 semester. Our findings support the notion that in-person schooling during the pandemic may serve as an equalizer for lower-achieving students, particularly from historically marginalized or vulnerable student populations.","subject":"COVID-19, Pandemics, Reading Achievement, Achievement Gains, Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5, Urban Schools, Student Characteristics, School Districts, Elementary School Students, In Person Learning, Electronic Learning, Distance Education","source":"Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Evidence of Efficacy of the &quot;Integrated Literacy Study Group&quot; Professional Learning Program to Enhance Reading Instruction for Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders","author":"Benner, Gregory J., Filderman, Marissa J., Barnard-Brak, Lucy, Pennefather, Jordan, Smith, Jean Louise M., Strycker, Lisa A.","description":"This article reports on a pilot study of the &quot;Integrated Literacy Study Group,&quot; a digitally delivered professional learning intervention to prepare elementary school teachers to provide evidence-based reading instruction and behavioral strategies to students with or are at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders.

Past research in this area tends to foreground either the curriculum or teachers' practices. We propose a more comprehensive view of science instruction, one that requires attention to teachers' practice, the instructional task, and students' engagement. In this study, by examining the implementation of the same lesson across three different classrooms, our analysis of classroom videos and artifacts of students' work revealed how the interaction of teachers' practices, students' intellectual engagement, and a cognitively demanding task together support rigorous instruction.

Dialogic writing assessment is an approach to conducting writing conferences that foregrounds students' composing process so that teachers can assess and support that process with instructional feedback. Because such feedback is immediate, teachers can observe how students take it up. While dialogic assessment has shown promise as an approach to revealing and supporting students' writing processes in English Language Arts classrooms, it remains to be explored how this approach can support developing writers in other subject areas.

This book aligns Montessori didactic materials and pedagogy, developed over a century ago, with current research on reading development. Readers will gain a solid overview of the Montessori philosophy and method, specifically those related to reading and language development, enabling them to support their practice in today's educational context while inspiring the wider field of education. The authors explain how the Montessori approach is inherently aligned with the Science of Reading in that they are both scientifically based and contain methods that follow a logical, systematic, and explicit progression of teaching and learning. Montessori education supports instructional differentiation that is cognizant of children's need for independence and highly mindful of literacy and language development. This book provides valuable contributions to all educators implementing Science of Reading and structured literacy in their practice, and is a must-have for Montessori teachers (preschool to grade 3) and those that prepare, coach, and supervise them. This book: (1) Aligns the Montessori curriculum to reading research, currently known as the Science of Reading; (2) Explains how the Montessori curriculum builds reading skills, background knowledge, and vocabulary across disciplines; (3) Shows educators how to balance state requirements and standards with maintaining a pedagogy aligned with Montessori principles; (4) Provides descriptions of teaching materials, classroom examples, and images; (5) Demonstrates how to use Montessori methods to support multiculturalism and differentiation to meet the needs of diverse students; (6) Includes suggested progressions of development, such as phonological awareness, that extend lessons using the Movable Alphabet; and (7) Explores multisensory approaches to language and literacy instruction.

Design\/methodology\/approach: A general linear model using 837 student evaluations from 191 US public higher education institutions investigates the impact on student performance and how performance was related to a number of covariates, namely, online experience of instructor prior to shut downs, discipline of study and size of institution. Findings: The analysis finds an overall grade point average (GPA) increase of 0.10 (out of 4.0) associated with the shift away from face-to-face instruction. In exploring potential covariates, only institutional size was significant in explaining this increase in GPA. This supports the notion that despite hardships inherent with the abrupt switch to online education across the country that student grades as a whole did not suffer. Research limitations\/implications: The source of data was self-reported. In addition, GPA is an imperfect measure of student learning. Despite this, because GPA is highly correlated with student satisfaction, retention and matriculation, it is relevant. Practical implications: This study suggests that the rapid transition to online instruction did not negatively impact student performance and may have marginally increased these marks. These findings were cross-disciplinary and not influenced by the instructor's prior online teaching experience. These findings support the idea that institutions and instructors should be more willing to use a variety of delivery modes going forward. Originality\/value: The data set used is uniquely large and varied in the number of institutions, professors, students and discipline.

Noting the paradoxes and dynamics of the welfare-state policy of 'school for all under one roof' at the intersections between the policy and practice level, we posit that migrant students are regulated as a homogeneous group that is expected to be 'the same' but is simultaneously considered to be 'different' from other, majority students. The findings thus reveal the paradox of welfare-state education policies and practice: while macro scale policy for migrant education aims to emphasise difference through MTI, the social consequences at the micro level show the opposite; namely, that MTI produces feelings of sameness and belonging among migrant students.","subject":"Native Language Instruction, Social Systems, Immigrants, Educational Policy, Foreign Countries, Policy Analysis, Educational History, Student Attitudes, Educational Practices, Social Integration, Individual Differences, Student Diversity, Elementary Secondary Education, Educational Experience, Comparative Education, Second Language Learning","source":"European Educational Research Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands"},{"title":"Enhancing Students&apos; Concept Understanding through Collaborative-Metacognitive Use of Science Literature","author":"Daloos, Ma.

Self-determination skills include: 1) decision-making, 2) goal setting, 3) self-awareness, 4) problem-solving, 5) self-advocacy, 6) self-monitoring, and 7) self-efficacy. Researchers suggest that youth with or at-risk for emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are less knowledgeable about self-determination skills and how to apply them to their daily lives. This is particularly true for those served in restrictive education settings (e.g., juvenile justice facilities) who often struggle with setting goals and self-monitoring progress. Equipping youth with or at-risk for EBD in restrictive education settings with self-determination skills is a critical aspect of positive youth development. The purpose of this manuscript is to assist staff in juvenile justice facilities with strategies so as to infuse self-determination instruction into five key areas: 1) resiliency, 2) assessments, 3) treatment\/programming, 4) education, and 5) transition. An overview of each area is provided, along with examples of self-determination integration.

Chinese characters represent three types of phonetic regularity: regular, semi-regular, and irregular depending on the degree of reliability of the pronunciation information provided by the phonetic component. This study investigated whether adult non-native Chinese learners can use partial phonological information encoded in semi-regular characters to learn the pronunciations of new characters. A total of 55 college students, enrolled in an intensive Chinese program with varying proficiency levels, were taught the pronunciations of 18 novel compound characters of three phonetic regularity types over three trials. Non-native Chinese learners of advanced and intermediate levels learned the pronunciations of regular characters (initial-same and final-same), which contain full information about pronunciation, and semi-regular characters (initial-different, final-same), which contain partial information about pronunciation, significantly better than irregular characters (initial-different and final-different), which contain misleading pronunciation information. The performance difference between semi-regular and irregular characters decreased over trials. Novice students demonstrated limited ability in using partial information to learn to pronounce characters compared to intermediate and advanced students. These results provide implications for effective character instruction for adult learners of Chinese with varying Chinese proficiency levels.","subject":"Orthographic Symbols, Reading Processes, Language Proficiency, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Pronunciation Instruction, Decoding (Reading), Phonetics, Undergraduate Students, Novices, Advanced Students, Comparative Analysis, Phonology, College Second Language Programs, Chinese","source":"Language Teaching Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Teaching Writing in Primary Education (Grades 1-6) in Australia: A National Survey","author":"de Abreu Malpique, Anabela, Valcan, Debora, Pino-Pasternak, Deborah, Ledger, Susan","description":"Providing adequate writing instruction and practice in schools is an essential cornerstone of writing development and it affords a diagnostic approach for teachers. But what writing instruction is being practiced in Australian primary schools? The aim of this study was to survey a sample of teachers (n = 310) about their instructional practices for writing and their preparation and self-efficacy to teach writing. The majority of the teachers surveyed indicated they allocated on average less than three hours per week for writing practice in their classrooms, with findings further showing a large variability in the frequency of writing practice ranging from 15\u00a0min to 7.5\u00a0h per week. Findings suggested an emphasis placed on teaching foundational skills, such as spelling, over the teaching of process skills, such as planning and revising. Results further indicated that less emphasis is placed on teaching handwriting and typing. The majority of participating teachers reported implementing only six of the 20\u00a0different instructional practices included in the survey on a weekly basis, with school-home strategies being the least frequently reported strategies to foster students' writing development. Most teachers expressed positive beliefs about their preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing significantly and statistically accounted for variability in using evidence-based practices, teaching foundational skills, and teaching process skills.

Content analysis of the in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 informants reveals that the teachers and students all demonstrated varying degrees of decolonial awareness related to the marginalized status of Chinese philosophy in Anglo-Eurocentric disciplinary systems and adopted the following strategies to decolonialize the curriculum and foster epistemic justice in the unequal geopolitics associated with knowledge production: (1) historicizing Chinese philosophy as a modern discipline that has emerged from inter-knowledge dialogues across philosophical traditions and is still in constant tension with the complex interplay of the semi-colonial, imperial, and Cold War legacies; (2) abandoning the Anglo-Eurocentric benchmark by pluralizing the disciplinary contemporaneity, and (3) cultivating epistemic trust in Chinese through intercultural translation. Moreover, the flexible shuttling between Chinese and English in EMI classrooms and tutorial sessions helped the informants to observe the decolonial awareness that was inherent in their understanding of the discipline-specific ontology. The findings suggest the agentive potential of teachers and international students to foster epistemic justice in EMI curriculum design and implementation that counters the hegemony of English as a colonial force.

As the COVID-19 pandemic took form and continued to impact education in the following 2020\/2021 academic year, multiple concerns were raised about possible negative effects on students' learning. The current longitudinal replication study examined this proposition for second-grade students in Norway. In a previous investigation (Skar et al. Journal of Educational Psychology 114:1553-1566, 2022), we found that scores for quality of writing, handwriting fluency, and attitude toward writing of first-grade children tested immediately after emergency remote instruction ended in the Spring of 2020 (During COVID-19 cohort) were lower than the scores of first-grade students from the same schools tested a year earlier before the start of the pandemic (Before COVID-19 cohort). In the present study, we compared the scores for the During COVID-19 cohort (333 girls, 308 boys) on these same writing measures 1\u00a0year later at the end of second grade to a During COVID-19 cohort of second-graders (888 girls, 780 boys) from the same schools tested 2\u00a0years earlier before the start of the pandemic.

This unexpected switching to online teaching was challenging for both teachers and students, and restrictions that were put in place because of pandemic made this challenge even greater. However, new ways of teaching might also open new opportunities for students' learning. The research question driving our study was as follows: how do students regulate their learning and specifically their choice of resources and peer learning in university mathematics classes that are fully taught online as offered during the COVID-19 pandemic? We report on a longitudinal, qualitative study in which students recorded a brief audio diary twice a week over one whole semester (14\u00a0weeks). We focused on three students who completed 70 interviews in total and finished the semester with varying degrees of success. The results show how the students structured their studying (e.g., the roles that deadlines or synchronous teaching events played). They illustrate the strengths and limitations of digital materials provided by the lecturer and the use of complementary media. Further, the pandemic uncovered the double-edged role of simple, often anonymous exchanges (e.g., via Discord servers), with few binding forces for either side, and the significance of stable learning partnerships for students' success. Our research highlights aspects that should be focal points when comparing traditional instruction and online instruction during the pandemic from a self-regulatory perspective.

Factors such as the curriculum, instructors' beliefs about second language learning, and their confidence play a role in this discrepancy.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Teaching Methods, Student Attitudes, Teacher Effectiveness, Teacher Student Relationship, Pronunciation Instruction, Foreign Countries, Secondary School Students, Comparative Analysis, Cross Cultural Studies, Immigrants, Refugees, Experienced Teachers, Educational Background, Student Characteristics, Teacher Characteristics, Error Correction, Feedback (Response), Language Proficiency, Questionnaires, Multilingualism","source":"PROFILE: Issues in Teachers' Professional Development","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Australia, Japan"},{"title":"Preparing Law Enforcement Officers to Engage Successfully with Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Evaluation of a Performance-Based Approach","author":"Hinkle, Karlie A., Lerman, Dorothea C.","description":"Law enforcement officers (LEOs) may use physical force unnecessarily or escalate problem behavior when attempting to gain the compliance of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Copenhaver &amp; Tewksbury in American Journal of Criminal Justice 44:309--333, 2019).

Prior research has revealed links between teacher beliefs about pronunciation teaching and teachers' own experience (e.g. amount of teacher training and teaching experience). However, no research has to date focused on how teachers' experience and their beliefs are intertwined, possibly affecting teacher assessments of L2 speakers' pronunciation. For this study, 77 Japanese pre-service teachers of English completed an online questionnaire examining their beliefs about the teaching of English pronunciation and eliciting details about their L2 teaching and learning experience. Additionally, pre-service teachers assessed 40 Japanese secondary school students performing an extemporaneous speech task, rating these speakers for comprehensibility, accentedness, and fluency. Results showed that pre-service teachers could be categorized into two distinct profiles, defined by joint contributions of pre-service teachers' experience (a mixture of language learning\/teaching experience and pronunciation-related instruction) and their beliefs (teachability of L2 pronunciation and approaches to its teaching). Pre-service teachers with more experience appeared to be more skeptical about how (easily) L2 pronunciation can be learned and taught and also provided harsher accentedness ratings, compared to pre-service teachers with less experience, revealing links between experience, beliefs, and speech assessments. Taken together, the findings reveal how pre-service teachers' experience might shape their beliefs and assessments, implying that teacher educators must encourage future teachers to hold positive views about the teachability of L2 pronunciation by shifting their attention toward communicatively oriented dimensions of L2 speech and by providing teachers with pedagogical skills to target these dimensions.","subject":"Preservice Teachers, Student Attitudes, Language Teachers, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Speech Communication, Task Analysis, Intelligibility, Classification, Profiles, English (Second Language), Schemata (Cognition), Pronunciation, Pronunciation Instruction, Learning Experience, Secondary School Students, Language Fluency, Teaching Methods, Teaching Skills, Foreign Countries, Teacher Education Programs","source":"Language Teaching Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Japan"},{"title":"Applying Co-Teaching Models to Enhance Partnerships between Teachers and Speech-Language Pathologists","author":"Zimmerman, Kathleen N., Chow, Jason C., Majeika, Caitlyn, Senter, Reed","description":"U.S. schools are required to educate students in the least restrictive environment (LRE).

This research paper utilized the Descriptive-Correlational research design to determine the level of grammatical and academic writing competence and to determine possible associations between them. The ninety (90) respondents were from the Grade 10 students enrolled in Special Science Class selected using a stratified sampling technique. The researcher-made questionnaire was given to the students through an online platform that has gone through validity and reliability testing. The statistical tools used were the mean and standard deviation to determine the levels of competence, and the Spearman Rank Order coefficient ? was used to determine the relationship between grammar and academic writing competence. The results in the grammar (M=28.29, SD=3.92) and academic writing tests (M=20.37, SD=3.25) revealed that the students are moving towards mastery, likewise, it showed that there is no significant relationship between the grammatical competence and the students' academic writing competence (p-value = 0.3121). Several variables are also measured to determine the influence of these factors, such as sex and parents' educational attainment. This study revealed that the students' sex has no significant difference in the students' level of competence in grammar and academic writing, while the students' parents' highest educational attainment has a significant difference with the students' academic writing competence, especially with parents' that has a post-graduate degree.

One of the most powerful lessons a teacher must learn is that classroom management is not about control; it's about delivering the support and facilitating the routines that will make the classroom work for each student, and thus, set all students free to be successful learners. In &quot;Leading and Managing a Differentiated Classroom,&quot; Carol Ann Tomlinson and Marcia B. Imbeau explore the central priorities and mindsets of differentiation and provide practical guidelines for making effective student-centered, academically responsive instruction a reality. Their classroom management approach is based on three critical understandings: (1) When students are engaged, they have no motivation to misbehave; (2) When students understand that their teacher sees them as worthwhile people with significant potential, it opens doors to learning; and (3) The classroom can't work for anybody until it works for everybody. Written for K-12 teachers and instructional leaders, this book is packed with strategies for structuring and pacing lessons, organizing learning spaces and materials, starting and stopping class with purpose, setting up and managing routines, and shifting gears if something isn't going well. It also gives teachers the guidance they need to help students, colleagues, and parents understand the goals of differentiated instruction and contribute to its success. Along with examples of recommended practice drawn from real-life classrooms at a variety of grade levels, you will find answers to frequently asked questions and specific advice for balancing content requirements and the needs of learners. You'll gain confidence as a leader for and in your differentiated classroom and be better prepared to teach in a way that's more efficient and rewarding for you and more effective for every student in your care.","subject":"Teacher Leadership, Classroom Techniques, Individualized Instruction, Elementary Secondary Education, World Views, Teacher Student Relationship","source":"ASCD","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Teacher Candidate Self-Efficacy and Ability to Teach Literacy: A Comparison of Residency and Traditional Teacher Preparation Models","author":"Mazzye, Doreen L., Duffy, Michelle A., Lamb, Richard L.","description":"This comparative study explored self-efficacy and ability for scientifically-based literacy instruction between a traditional and residency model of teacher preparation.

Results: The multivariate analyses across grade groups revealed the continued progress in children's performances on morphological awareness but not on phonological and orthographic awareness. More important, hierarchical regressions exhibited the same pattern across grades, suggesting that morphological awareness was the sole consistent indicator of reading comprehension in all grades. Finally, lexical inferencing ability contributed to reading comprehension only in fifth-grade students after accounting for the effects of metalinguistic awareness.

Children with disabilities have a right to services that address their IEP goals during the pandemic, and teachers are being asked to be innovative and flexible and work with families to create equitable learning opportunities to support children's interactions with each other. During this unusual and difficult time, many families do not have access to email to answer questionnaires, limited capacity to answer phone calls, unreliable or no access to the internet, or no or inadequate devices to support instructional platforms. District and school leaders need to support teachers in identifying and addressing these challenges to provide equitable access to learning opportunities.

However, many children have difficulty using fractions, especially those struggling with mathematics. In this study, we examined the effect of a Tier 2 multicomponent fraction intervention for fifth graders, using a multiple-probe design across groups. The intervention included multiple instructional components: (a) explicit instruction; (b) multiple representations; (c) addressing misconceptions; (d) flexibility, reversibility, and generalizations; and (e) self-graphing. The intervention addressed fraction concepts and skills that need to be taught at Grade Levels 3 to 5 based on the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics content standards. The researcher provided the intervention in an intervention classroom at a U.S. charter school three times a week. The total session length ranged from 885 to 906 min across the groups. The results of this study indicated a functional relation between the fraction intervention, and all six students' percentages of correct answers obtained using fraction probes. The results from the fidelity of intervention and assessment and social validity during the intervention were also reported.

The study was carried out through basic qualitative research design. Qualitative research is conducted with an aim to uncover facts about individuals' experiences, perceptions, and perspectives toward a particular phenomenon. The participants of the study were 201 teachers, working in different grades and majors. Of the participants, 58% (n = 116) were female and 42% (n = 85) were male. The data collection tools included an electronic opinion form and focus group interview. The collected data were analyzed through content analysis. Findings of the study indicated that professional development activities and innovative implementations made teachers happy regarding their instructional practices. Second, teachers felt unhappy when they disregarded students' individual differences. Third, teachers' instructional goals were related to improving their content knowledge and technological competencies. They needed administrative support and time to achieve their instructional goals.

Even so, some of these videos achieve good ratings on online platforms. A possible reason is that explainer videos with misconceptions foster an &quot;illusion of understanding&quot;--the mistaken belief that a topic has been understood. Misconceptions close to everyday experiences might appear more attractive than scientifically correct explanations. This experimental study (N = 149 physics learners with a low prior knowledge on average, sample of convenience) was conducted to explore this effect. Two explainer videos were developed to be comparable in terms of comprehensibility and duration. The explanatory approach was the only difference between the two videos. While the experimental group watched a video introducing the concept of force using misconceptions, the control group watched a scientifically correct video. Learners from the experimental group developed an equal belief of understanding, but more misconceptions and fewer scientifically correct conceptions than those from the control group. We argue that this illusion of understanding might become problematic (a) in physics instruction because students who have watched a misleading video might regard further teaching in school as irrelevant, and (b) learners might tend to rate videos including misconceptions better on an online platform like YouTube. Future studies should examine these two possible consequences.","subject":"Misconceptions, Physics, Video Technology, Science Instruction, Science Education, Beliefs, Scientific Literacy, Accuracy, Student Attitudes, Scientific Concepts, Instructional Effectiveness","source":"International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Impacts and Experiences of Corequisite Remediation for Latinx Students.

However, there is limited evidence available on differential impacts of corequisite models by race and ethnicity. To better understand the potential for differential impacts of English corequisites for Latinx students, this study leverages data from a randomized control trial across five large urban community colleges across Texas. We also utilize student survey data to develop a deeper understanding of how corequisites shape the experiences of Latinx students in their college-level English courses. Latinx students in our study colleges saw larger benefits from taking corequisite English than non-Latinx students in terms of gateway course completion. The survey findings suggest that corequisites provided an environment where Latinx students felt less academically overwhelmed and less bored relative to patterns observed for traditional DE course enrollees. However, Latinx students in corequisites also reported being less likely to participate in class discussions and ask questions relative to their non-Latinx peers.","subject":"Hispanic American Students, Community College Students, English Instruction, Required Courses, Remedial Instruction, Student Experience, Outcomes of Education, Racial Differences, Ethnicity, Emotional Response, Psychological Patterns, Student Participation, Equal Education, Control Groups, Academic Achievement","source":"Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Texas"},{"title":"School Qualifications and Youth Custody.

They spend an average of 7 months in youth custody and such incarceration has been related to negative outcomes in the longer term even if they can establish themselves in the labour market. In this paper, we evaluate whether there is a relationship between GCSE qualifications in English and maths and the probability of youth custody using administrative data in England. We are hindered in this because the majority of young people who end up in youth custody are not entered or fail their GCSEs in these subjects. Although regression results are consistent with educational achievement being a factor in why people end up in youth custody, they strongly suggest that both non-entry\/low achievement and youth custody are correlated with severe vulnerabilities which are partially picked up by the explanatory variables available in administrative data (in particular indicators for special needs, disadvantage and being from some ethnic minority groups).

However, relatively little research has systematically investigated the learning processes that support teachers to skillfully enact these challenging pedagogies. In this study, we used a mixed-methods, case-comparison design to examine one kind of teacher learning routine, Mental Simulations for Teacher Reflection (MSTR), for advancing robust teacher learning in the context of one mathematics-focused instructional coaching intervention. Specifically, this study draws from a large, state-wide representative dataset to select carefully matched, contrasting cases to analyze the quality of coach-teacher conversations for teachers who showed very similar baseline instructional quality but then large differences in levels of improvement. We began by qualitatively coding detailed transcripts from selected coach-teacher pairs as they reflected on lesson artifacts (i.e., lesson plans, student work, and coach observations) using MSTR as an analytical lens. Next, quantitative analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which mental simulations characterized significant differences in the conversations of high- vs. low-instructional growth pairs. Lastly, additional qualitative analyses explored finer-grain distinctions in the quality of mental simulation talk in high- vs. low-growth pairs. Results: Quantitative analyses showed high-growth pairs were significantly more likely to engage in mental simulation talk compared to their low-growth counterparts. Moreover, the high-growth pairs were much more likely to initiate (i.e., raise an instructional ambiguity or problem for discussion) as well as complete (i.e., generate and weigh alternative instructional strategies) a MSTR routine. Qualitative analyses further revealed that engaging teachers' in-depth pedagogical reasoning to connect specific teaching moves to conceptual learning goals in mental simulations was a key distinction of the high-growth coaches. Conclusions: These findings indicate MSTR captured meaningful variation in coaching quality in this context. Notably, all coaches discussed the same instructional topics with teachers (i.e., teaching--learning goals and dimensions) and engaged in the same training that did not explicitly include MSTR, suggesting the possibility that MSTR captured a more implicit process of effective coaches. This study thus offers insight into the 'black box' of teacher learning and how it can be supported in similar professional learning contexts.","subject":"Cognitive Processes, Simulation, Schemata (Cognition), Reflective Teaching, Mathematics Instruction, Coaching (Performance), Teacher Improvement, Mathematics Teachers, Teaching Methods, Teacher Effectiveness, Interaction","source":"International Journal of STEM Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Tennessee"},{"title":"What if It Were Otherwise?

Then we interviewed 30 high school English Language Arts teachers from across the U.S., asking them to imagine what, how, and why they might teach with these alternative prompts in mind. Compared to their responses to a current Common Core aligned exam, when teachers responded to the alternative prompts, they were more likely to imagine selecting texts by authors of color, plan a wide variety of discussion-based and writing activities, highlight the ethical dimensions of the teaching of literature, and envision the pleasure of aligning their beliefs with their instructional choices.

Among students with higher prior algebraic knowledge, higher in-game progress was related to higher algebraic knowledge after the intervention. Higher in-game progress was also associated with higher end-of-year mathematics achievement, and this association was stronger among students with lower prior mathematics achievement.

One way to deal with this problem is through teaching about the Nature of Science (NOS). NOS can be understood as a pedagogical construct aiming to foster the understanding of the main characteristics of scientific work. Recently, several researchers have advocated that we should consider pluralism within science when teaching about NOS. Accordingly, there have been efforts to develop ways of promoting instruction on NOS considering the specificity of distinct scientific fields. Aligned with this perspective, this paper aims to put forward a model for teaching NOS in the context of biological education. This model, named &quot;Integrative Model for Teaching NOS in Biological Education&quot; (IM-NOSBIO), is based on three pillars. The first is the Family Resemblance Approach to Nature of Science (FRA), developed by Erduran and Dagher. The second consists in the Conceptual Framework of Biology proposed by Scheiner. The third is the Pragmatic Conception of Models as Epistemic Artifacts put forward by Knuuttila. We propose that IM-NOSBIO has the potential to promote teaching and learning about different aspects of scientific knowledge and practice by taking advantage of how they present themselves in biological sciences teaching. To illustrate this potential, we offer an example of how this model can be used for teaching about certain aspects of NOS based on the history of the cell theory.","subject":"Scientific Principles, Science Instruction, Biology, Teaching Methods, Biological Sciences, Cytology","source":"Science & Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Go-Lab Platform, an Inquiry-Learning Space: Investigation into Students&apos; Technology Acceptance, Knowledge Integration, and Learning Outcomes","author":"Sui, Chi-Jung, Chen, Hsin-Chueh, Cheng, Ping-Han, Chang, Chun-Yen","description":"Utilizing an inquiry-learning space (ILS) via the Go-Lab platform, we investigated students' technology acceptance, knowledge integration [KI] process, and learning outcomes of both the high-achiever KI student and low-achiever KI student.

The analysis of students' interaction in the ILS and domain knowledge tests was conducted through descriptive statistics, t-tests, Pearson's correlation, and content analysis to indicate the direction and relationship between students' KI processes and learning outcomes. A technology acceptance questionnaire was analyzed through descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation to reveal whether students accepted learning on the Go-Lab platform. The study showed that (i) students responded positively to the perceived usefulness of the Go-Lab platform, (ii) the high-achiever KI students could gradually construct links from simple to complex and diverse among genetic ideas, and the low-achiever almost built simple links, but (iii) the high-achiever and low-achiever KI students had similar learning outcomes. These findings have implications that the instruction design of knowledge integration tasks promotes students' Mendelian genetics conceptual understanding and KI progress.","subject":"Student Attitudes, Technology Integration, Technology Uses in Education, High Achievement, Low Achievement, Inquiry, Genetics, Science Instruction, Grade 7, Knowledge Level, Interaction, Value Judgment, Scientific Concepts, Concept Formation, Foreign Countries","source":"Journal of Science Education and Technology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"title":"Application of Human Capital Theory to Understand Funding Inequities in Dual Language Programs","author":"Doane, Jenna","description":"Language is a form of human capital. Human capital refers to skills an individual needs to succeed within the labor market. Originating from The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 (Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1968), one of many purposes of dual language programs (DLPs) was to provide equal access to classroom opportunities for all students, regardless of their native language. The goal of bilingual programs is to promote the literacy of the English language and their home language. Two-way DLPs in schools were created to help strengthen the English literacy of non-native-English-speaking students, while simultaneously supporting their performance in school. English-speaking students are also within the classroom, while instruction is split between English and the home language of the non-native English speakers. Despite the original focus of equity in these programs, there seems to have been a growing interest in DLPs from native English speakers whose goals are most closely related to human capital and globalization views. In addition, disparities in funding highlight the lack of value placed on DLPs when it comes to equity for non-native English speakers, which are ultimately rooted in the history of oppressive bilingual education policies. The globalization view, coupled with funding inequities, could lead to resource hoarding among certain groups, ultimately negatively affecting English learners' labor market outcomes later in life due to an inability to access DLPs and utilize the benefits that come from them.","subject":"Educational Finance, Equal Education, Bilingual Education Programs, Native Speakers, English, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Human Capital, Global Approach, Bilingual Education, Educational Legislation, Access to Education, Educational Opportunities, Educational Equity (Finance), Educational Policy, Power Structure, Resource Allocation, Social Justice","source":"Journal of Education Human Resources","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Differential Effects and Success Stories of Distance Education in COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Development of Reading Comprehension in Primary Schools","author":"Segers, Eliane, In 't Zandt, M., Stoep, J., Daniels, L., Roelofs, J., Gubbels, J.","description":"In the current study, the development in reading comprehension performance of students in lower-SES versus higher-SES schools during and after school closures due to COVID-19 lockdowns was examined, and compared to a normed reference group. Furthermore, we explored protective factors against negative effects at the time of school closures, by pinpointing successful practices in a sub sample of resilient lower-SES schools. The total sample consisted of 2202 students followed from grade 2-4. Overall, we found that students in lower-SES schools made less progress over time than students in higher-SES schools. On average, students made less progress during the lockdowns, but here, the interaction with SES was not significant. Students' reading comprehension levels partially recovered after the lockdowns. Questionnaire-data revealed that schools were better prepared during the second lockdown, with teachers making more use of digital means, and providing more online reading instruction. In addition, collaboration with the parents seemed to have improved. The in depth interviews with resilient lower-SES schools revealed that the introduction of online education and investing in educational partnerships with parents may have helped to minimize the negative impact of lockdowns. We conclude that lockdowns have a negative effect on the development of reading education, but that students are resilient. Digital means and partnership with parents may be seen as protective factors to attenuate the negative effects of emergency remote teaching.","subject":"Outcomes of Education, Distance Education, COVID-19, Pandemics, School Closing, Reading Comprehension, Elementary School Students, Socioeconomic Status, Parent Participation, Reading Achievement, Reading Instruction, Technology Uses in Education, Partnerships in Education, Resilience (Psychology), Educational Practices","source":"Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Online Education via Media Platforms and Applications as an Innovative Teaching Method","author":"Sofi-Karim, Mahdi, Bali, Ahmed Omar, Rached, Kardo","description":"Online teaching has globally become a part of the learning process and has been more well-established in developed countries. In developing countries, online teaching or e-Learning is not practiced or recognized officially by educational organizations and policymakers. On the other hand, it is well-known that computers and technology are the future; in such a case, the advancement of distance-learning or online learning is immensely remarkable. It has reduced teachers' and students' introversion concerning e-learning and technology and has provided a platform for learning new technologies and developing new skills. The recent COVID-19 lockdown impelled governments to start implementing E-learning in schools, which resulted in several challenges. This study attempts to analyze and interpret the challenges and potentials of implementing online learning by surveying through an online questionnaire using 'Google Forms' (N = 968) with responses from high school and primary school English teachers during the first week of March through the last week of April. The findings revealed that most teachers had negative perceptions of implementing e-learning for several reasons, including lack of essential facilities such as electricity, electronic devices, and the absence of required skills. The actual contributions of students and educators are also among the major obstacles. This research suggests introducing Information Communication Technology modules across media platforms and applications in the education departments, opening intensive courses for teachers, and developing educational facilities in the education departments and schools to overcome these limitations and challenges.","subject":"Teaching Methods, Instructional Innovation, Electronic Learning, Web Based Instruction, COVID-19, Pandemics, Information Technology, Elementary School Teachers, High School Teachers, Teacher Attitudes, Language Teachers, Program Implementation, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Foreign Countries","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Iraq"},{"title":"Integrating Intercultural Communicative Competence into an Online EFL Classroom: An Empirical Study of a Secondary School in Thailand","author":"Lee, Tzu-Yin, Ho, Yun-Chi, Chen, Che-Han","description":"Intercultural communicative competence (ICC) has been widely acknowledged as a core element of today's foreign language education. However, even though the importance of intercultural language teaching is commonly recognized among adult learners and at the post-secondary level, teachers of adolescent English learners often find it hard to effectively incorporate culture into English learning because of the lack of an instructional model facilitating their students' intercultural development and English learning experiences. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether integrating intercultural learning into an online EFL curriculum can elevate teenage EFL students' L2 motivation, intercultural communicative competence, and English proficiency. The researchers used a quasi-experimental design by randomly selecting two eighth-grade classes in a secondary school in northern Thailand, with one class designated as the experimental group (N = 31) and the other as the control group (N = 28). The effects of this teaching experiment were then examined using both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings demonstrated that the students in the experimental group showed a greater improvement compared with those of the students in the control group after an 8-week, interculturally embedded English curriculum. The results suggested that ICC is conducive to adolescent EFL students' intercultural development as well as their English learning motivation and outcome. The applications of ICC-based EFL instruction in similar contexts are discussed.","subject":"Intercultural Communication, Communicative Competence (Languages), English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Learning Motivation, Language Proficiency, Secondary School Students, Comparative Analysis, Foreign Countries, Cultural Awareness, Learning Experience, Grade 8, Online Courses, Teaching Methods, Achievement Gains, Student Improvement","source":"Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Thailand"},{"title":"Embracing Pivotal Teaching Moments: Elementary Teachers&apos; Role in Advancing High Cognitive Levels of Mathematics Discourse","author":"Olawoyin, Omomayowa, Kribs, Christopher M., Joswick, Candace","description":"The study of pivotal teaching moments (PTMs) offers significant insights into mathematics classroom interactions. PTMs are student-generated instances within a lesson that provide opportunities for teachers to modify planned instruction (Stockero &amp; Van Zoest, 2013). Given the importance of interactions and discourse in students' mathematical growth and understanding, we examine them in the context of &quot;PTM episode triples.&quot; PTM episode triples consist of three main elements: (1) a PTM, (2) a teacher response to the PTM, and (3) the immediately ensuing student utterance. Analysis of data from nine elementary mathematics lessons shows that teacher responses that explicitly &quot;pursued students' thinking&quot; elicited\u00a0significantly higher cognitive levels of student discourse than teachers who &quot;ignored or dismissed&quot; PTMs or simply &quot;acknowledged [PTMs] but continued as planned.&quot; While many researchers have focused on PTM episode &quot;doubles&quot; (combinations of student-generated interruptions and the teacher's response), no studies to our knowledge have addressed PTM episode &quot;triples&quot; as we have. Implications of these findings prove helpful for identifying concrete ways that educators can increase the cognitive level of student discourse within their classrooms. Further, our integration and modification of existing theory and frameworks for analyzing PTM episode triples--incorporating the relationship between PTMs and teachers' responses to them, on the one hand, and the cognitive level of the ensuing student utterance, on the other hand--are a unique contribution to the field and provide a method by which researchers and educators can study classroom practice.","subject":"Elementary School Teachers, Mathematics Instruction, Cognitive Processes, Discourse Modes, Teacher Response, Student Behavior, Interaction, Student Reaction, High Achievement, Classroom Environment, Educational Practices, Adjustment (to Environment)","source":"Mathematics Education Research Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Language, Mother-Tongue Education and Sustainable Development: Some Reflections on Gandhian Thought","author":"Pandey, Avinash Rambachan","description":"Mother-tongue education has increasingly become a keyword in formulations of development goals, especially the Sustainable Development Goals (2015). Achievement of these goals acquires a grave sense of urgency in light of the ever-increasing threat to the very fabric of our linguistic diversity. The basic premise of this article is that Gandhian thought can serve as a guiding principle in our struggle to stem the tsunami of language endangerment. Engagement with Gandhian thought enables us to critically examine the current presuppositions about development and the role of language in nation-building (especially in schools) and also inspires us to look for more sustainable alternatives. This article aims at examining the linguistic world order that Gandhi envisaged--an order where languages do not encroach upon each other. In postulating such a world order, Gandhi shows a keen awareness of the dangers that languages such as English could pose to mother tongues. Furthermore, diversity is not seen as a 'management' problem but rather a necessary condition for all that is human. Emphasis on ensuring that the child in school is an active producer rather than a passive consumer of knowledge, as well as envisaging the school as a resource centre for the neighbourhood ensures that the mother tongues (L-languages) and languages taught in schools (H-languages) enter into a harmonious and symmetrical pedagogical relationship rather than a relationship of violent conflict, which characterises the current linguistic world-order. The article argues that such a pedagogical relationship serves as a necessary component of any sustainable developmental paradigm.","subject":"Native Language Instruction, Educational Philosophy, Language Skill Attrition, Language Maintenance, Language Role, Social Integration, Language Attitudes, English (Second Language), Multilingualism, Language of Instruction, Sustainable Development, Language Usage, Language Planning, Educational Environment, Second Language Learning, Second Languages","source":"Contemporary Education Dialogue","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Adapting a Cooking, Food Budgeting and Nutrition Intervention for a Rural Community of American Indians with Type 2 Diabetes in the North-Central United States","author":"Brown, Meagan C., Hawley, Caitie, Ornelas, India J., Huber, Corrine, Best, Lyle, Thorndike, Anne N., Beresford, Shirley, Howard, Barbara V., Umans, Jason G., Hager, Arlette, Fretts, Amanda M.","description":"American Indian (AI) communities experience persistent diabetes-related disparities, yet few nutrition interventions are designed for AI with type 2 diabetes or address socio-contextual barriers to healthy eating.

Educators must identify early on whether students may struggle in order to target remediation. The purpose of the study was to elucidate whether an assessment tool administered before the start of a professional anatomy course correlated with allied health students' course performance. Students over four years were given a quiz covering anatomy knowledge they were expected to know upon matriculation to their professional program. A supplemental data form was administered at the course's conclusion to identify prior anatomy experience and topics in which students felt deficient. Pre-quiz scores significantly correlated with examination performance throughout the course. Students reported feeling most deficient in neurobiology (54.9%) and anatomy terminology (39.1%). Videos were created to target these deficient knowledge areas; students who watched the videos did better in course assessments than those who did not. Most respondents (98.0%) recommended students take an undergraduate anatomy course prior to starting a health professional program. These results indicate that a quiz assessing anatomy knowledge among matriculating students may identify students with the potential to struggle in a professional anatomy course early on. Responses outlined areas in which students felt deficient, which allows educators to target topics early with intervention tools such as the review videos in this study. Finally, most respondents strongly recommended undergraduate coursework in anatomy prior to starting a professional health program, which outlines students' recognition that a solid foundation in anatomical knowledge is important to success in professional programs.","subject":"Anatomy, Student Evaluation, Allied Health Occupations Education, Science Instruction, Video Technology, Undergraduate Students, Prerequisites, Remedial Instruction, Correlation, Science Tests, Knowledge Level, Identification, Graduate Study","source":"Anatomical Sciences Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Can Flipped Classroom Pedagogy Offer Promising Perspectives for Mathematics Education on Pandemic-Related Issues? A Systematic Literature Review","author":"Cevikbas, Mustafa, Kaiser, Gabriele","description":"Educators sometimes effect changes in education through the implementation of new ideas, and sometimes extraordinary circumstances force them to change their educational approaches, as during the COVID-19 crisis. Although we live in a digital age, the limited use of technology in education, particularly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers' insufficient experience with online or hybrid learning and teaching approaches resulted in several countries being unprepared for education during the pandemic. The flipped classroom (FC) is an innovative pedagogy with the potential to engage students in mathematics education using hybrid education combined with online and face-to-face learning, which is especially important during a pandemic. However, despite the high expectations surrounding this innovative approach, to date, no systematic literature review has discussed the opportunities and pitfalls of FCs in mathematics education regarding pandemic-related issues. In the present systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap and highlight the importance of flipping mathematics instruction during the pandemic and beyond. The results, which are based on textual analysis of 97 eligible articles, demonstrate that FC is a promising pedagogy that has numerous benefits for mathematics teaching and learning, although it is not a panacea for pandemic-related issues, as it also has several significant pitfalls. Overall, if the mechanism of mathematics education is to be crisis-ready, we should learn from experiences during the pandemic. In this regard, the current review contributes to research in mathematics education with the aim of gaining insight into successful implementations of FC pedagogy, not only during the pandemic but also beyond the crisis era of a pandemic.","subject":"Flipped Classroom, Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Pandemics, COVID-19, Technology Uses in Education, Barriers, Educational Benefits, Futures (of Society)","source":"ZDM: Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Assessing Writing Motivation: A Systematic Review of K-5 Students&apos;\u00a0Self-Reports","author":"Alves-Wold, Aline, Walgermo, Bente Rigmor, McTigue, Erin, Uppstad, Per Henning","description":"For attaining success in writing, motivation is essential. Crucially, instruction is dependent on knowing the student's capabilities and inner drives. To date, research on writing has yet to establish a consistent framework for assessing writing motivation, and often fails to acknowledge students' self-reports, rather favoring evaluations of students' writing motivation made by others, such as teachers and researchers. This limbo state originates partly from a general skepticism towards the trustworthiness of elementary students' self-reports. Nonetheless, the validity of such self-reports has been acknowledged in adjacent fields, such as reading. Aiming to establish a knowledge base from studies addressing students' voices, the present study adopts the method of a systematic review and investigates how writing motivation has been assessed in empirical studies (1996-2020) through K-5 students' self-reports. Of the 7047 studies identified through database search, 56 met the inclusion criteria and are examined in this review. Results indicate that (a) &quot;storytelling&quot; is the genre most used to operationalize writing in the investigations, (b) surveys and interview questions measuring students' &quot;attitude&quot; towards writing are the most common type of self-report used, and (c) students' voices are weighted differently across the studies. Findings suggest that future research should (1) work to counteract existing biases in writing tasks, (2) provide a rationale for their choice\/design of measure of motivation, and (3) report clearly whose voices are being heard (e.g., students', teachers', or researchers') and the appropriateness of this choice regarding study purpose, design, and findings.","subject":"Elementary School Students, Writing Attitudes, Student Motivation, Measurement Techniques, Writing Instruction, Self Evaluation (Individuals), Educational Research, Research Methodology","source":"Educational Psychology Review","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Science at the Center: Meaningful Science Learning in a Preschool Classroom","author":"Raven, Sara, Wenner, Julianne A.","description":"Even though children are natural scientists, many preschools isolate and limit science, which can cause children to miss out on valuable learning experiences and school readiness skills. Additionally, minimizing science at the preschool level fails to set a solid foundation for K-12 science education. In this single case study, we focused on the experiences and daily work of one constructivist-oriented preschool teacher who utilized science-based guided play and emergent curriculum as vehicles for important aspects of preschool learning. Findings demonstrate that with careful planning and intention, science can be utilized as a context for nonscience preschool learning objectives outlined by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, such as socioemotional development and early literacy. Further, being purposeful about taking up children's ideas about science can lead to rigorous engagement in the three dimensions of science found in the &quot;A Framework for K-12 Education&quot; as well as the Nature of Science. What is notable in this case study is that the teacher did not fundamentally alter her instruction, nor did she take up a prescribed science curriculum; rather, she utilized children's science noticings and wonderings about the world to build meaningful learning experiences. In this way, we see the efforts and outcomes of this teacher being attainable by other preschool teachers. From these findings, we put forward the Integrated Preschool Science Framework that can be used by researchers and teacher educators to think more deeply about how placing science at the center of preschoolers' learning can provide rich opportunities for supporting preschools in multiple learning domains.","subject":"Preschool Children, Preschool Education, Science Instruction, School Readiness, Play, Science Curriculum, Social Emotional Learning, Emergent Literacy","source":"Journal of Research in Science Teaching","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Effects of Teacher, Automated, and Combined Feedback on Syntactic Complexity in EFL Students&apos; Writing","author":"Thi, Nang Kham, Nikolov, Marianne","description":"Although studies on written feedback have confirmed the effectiveness of multiple sources of feedback in promoting learners' accuracy, much remains to be discovered about its impact on other aspects of language development.

In response to this need for research, the study investigated the effects of teacher, automated, and combined feedback on students' syntactic complexity over a 13-week semester. Our data collection included 270 students' texts including their drafts and revised texts and pre-and post-test writing.

Regardless of feedback from multiple sources, paired sample t-test results indicate no significant differences between initial and revised texts, resulting in minimal variance between comparison pairs. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the pre-and post-writing assessment in all complexity measures. These findings suggest that providing feedback on students' writing does not lead them to write less structurally complex texts. The syntactic complexity of their revised essays varied among high-, mid-, and low-achieving students.

The dominant group's confusion about intra-race mixedness and perceptions of Hannah as non-mixed complicated her situation. Hannah had little access to a majority heritage (New Zealander) identity, but also found her specific heritage identities occluded by an imposed single (&quot;Asian&quot;) identity. Nonetheless, on entering university both participants showed a strong desire to embrace their Koreanness through HL education or socialization with coethnic peers.

Data were collected from two intervention groups who engaged in a series of modeling lessons with the aid of digital tools for visualizing and explaining particle behavior across varied material phenomena. The two intervention groups engaged in a common set of modeling activities but differed in the use of one digital tool. Intervention students were interviewed in the week before the beginning of the intervention and the week following the completion of the intervention to assess the development of their models of matter. To provide a baseline for comparison, we assessed a third group of kindergarten children who did not receive any instruction on matter in the same time frame as the intervention students. Data were coded using cognitive science techniques of verbal protocol analysis. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to explore changes across the pre- and post-intervention interviews.

These limitations originated from a variety of sources, including state, school, and district leaders and family and community members, and encompassed a wide span of topics, including, but not limited to race- or gender-related topics. The multifaceted nature of these limitations highlights how teachers exist in an increasingly complex policy environment in which they must consider and weigh not only their own perspectives but also the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, along with numerous messages and directives from a variety of sources about what and how to teach. In this complex environment, the authors found that teachers' responses to restrictions on their classroom instruction ranged broadly from compliance with to resistance against these restrictions; teachers also engaged in numerous strategies to navigate the existence of these restrictions. Moreover, limitations placed on how teachers can address contentious topics may be leading to consequences for teachers' working conditions and for student learning. Teachers perceived that teaching students under these limitations has become more difficult and that these limitations make it more difficult to engage students in learning, support students' critical thinking skills, and develop students' ability to engage in perspective taking and empathy building.

Design and method: A quantitative study using a pre-\/post-intervention study design assessed nutritional knowledge, food preparation skills, cooking skills confidence, attitudes towards nutrition, and future diet and food practices among GAA players (n = 336) across the Island of Ireland who took part in a practical food skills and nutrition education workshop. Findings: The workshop was effective in improving culinary knowledge, skills and confidence. Post-session, in comparison with men, women were 'definitely' more confident in preparing the dish they cooked during the session (p [less than or equal to] 0.05) and in using a cooker to prepare a meal or snack (p [less than or equal to] 0.05). While nutrition knowledge improved for many participants, women knew 'a lot' more about the quantity of each type of food they needed to consume (p = 0.013) and portion sizes (p = 0.003). Most participants indicated that in the future, they were likely to try out other recipes (94%, n = 310), more likely to prepare a meal themselves (93%, n = 307) and make healthier food choices (92%, n = 304). Originality: Results indicate the benefits of an integrated nutrition education and food skills workshop in improving players' knowledge of nutrition and increasing confidence in relation to food preparation and cooking. As gender differences were found across a range of key knowledge and confidence outcomes, future food and nutrition education programmes may need to be tailored to take account of this.","subject":"Food, Nutrition, Eating Habits, Program Effectiveness, Workshops, Cooking Instruction, Athletes, Self Efficacy, Knowledge Level, Futures (of Society), Nutrition Instruction, Gender Differences, Health Behavior, Foreign Countries, National Organizations, Athletics","source":"Health Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Ireland"},{"title":"Revisiting Faculty Members&apos; Goals for the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory","author":"Connor, Megan C., Rocabado, Guizella A., Raker, Jeffrey R.","description":"Over a decade has passed since faculty members' goals for the undergraduate chemistry instructional laboratory were first investigated on a large, national scale in the United States. This study revisits these goals, using data from a 2022 national survey of chemistry faculty members in the United States (n = 521) to investigate current objectives, including how those goals vary with course, institutional context, and receipt of funding for improving undergraduate chemistry courses. A modified version of the Faculty Goals for Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory Instrument was used to measure goals, with psychometric evidence providing support for its use across the studied contexts, with the exception of the general chemistry laboratory. Goals were associated with course and receipt of funding but not institution type, both with regard to institutions' highest chemistry degree awarded and approval from the American Chemical Society to award certified bachelor's chemistry degrees. Results suggest that faculty members may adopt a distinct set of goals not immediately associated with the practice of chemistry in the general chemistry laboratory. Further, goals increasingly focus on providing research experience and cultivating disciplinary knowledge and skills with progression through the chemistry curriculum; this focus increases more abruptly when moving from large-enrollment lower-level courses to small-enrollment upper-level courses. Findings imply a need for increased efforts focused on (1) evaluating goals for the general chemistry laboratory, including whether those goals contribute to overarching curricular objectives, (2) promoting adoption of evidence-based pedagogies in large-enrollment contexts to better align instruction with the practice of chemistry, (3) supporting faculty members in procuring funding to improve courses, and (4) refining professional societies' evaluation criteria for undergraduate chemistry programs.","subject":"College Faculty, College Science, Undergraduate Study, Science Instruction, Science Laboratories, Goal Orientation, Evidence Based Practice, Educational Objectives, Chemistry, Science Process Skills","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Intelligent Tutoring Systems for Word Problem Solving in COVID-19\u00a0Days: Could They Have Been (Part of) the Solution?","author":"del Olmo-Mu\u00f1oz, Javier, Gonz\u00e1lez-Calero, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, Diago, Pascual D., Arnau, David, Arevalillo-Herr\u00e1ez, Miguel","description":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to the lockdown of schools in many countries, forcing teachers and students to carry out educational activities remotely. In the case of mathematics, developing remote instruction based on both synchronous and asynchronous technological solutions has proven to be an extremely complex challenge. Specifically, this was the case in topics such as word problem solving, as this domain requires intensive supervision and feedback from the teacher. In this piece of research, we present an evaluation of how technology is employed in the teaching of mathematics, with particular relevance to learning during the pandemic. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic review, revealing the almost complete absence of experiments in which the use of technology is not mediated by the teacher. These results reflect a pessimistic vision within the field of mathematics education about the possibilities of learning when the student uses technology autonomously. Bringing good outcomes out of a bad situation, the pandemic crisis may represent a turning point from which to start directing the research gaze towards technological environments such as those mediated by artificial intelligence. As an example, we provide a study illustrating to what extent intelligent tutoring systems can be cost-effective compared to one-to-one human tutoring and mathematic learning-oriented solutions for intensive supervision in the teaching of word problem solving, especially appropriate for remote settings. Despite the potential of these technologies, the experience also showed that student socioeconomic level was a determining factor in the participation rate with an intelligent tutoring system, regardless of whether or not the administration guaranteed students' access to technological resources during the COVID-19 situation.","subject":"COVID-19, Pandemics, School Closing, Distance Education, Mathematics Instruction, Word Problems (Mathematics), Problem Solving, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Intelligent Tutoring Systems","source":"ZDM: Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Effect of Web-Mediated, Blended, and Purely Online Learning on EFL Learners&apos; Writing Achievement in the Iranian Context: A Comparative Study","author":"Dousti, Masoumeh, Amirian, Zahra","description":"In the era of web-based technology, the conventional instructions seem archaic and need to be replaced or improved with more novel technology-enhanced instructions (TEIs) that have been reported to enrich the instructional settings by providing further innovative teaching and learning opportunities. As a result, the present study aimed at not only examining but also comparing the effectiveness of web-mediated, blended, and purely online learning instructions on EFL learners' writing achievement in the Iranian context. Therefore, 49 homogenous participants were randomly assigned into the web-mediated leaning (WML) group that attended the workshop physically at predetermined times, the enriched virtual blended learning (EVBL) group that not only was provided with online sessions but also received compulsory in-person instructional sessions, and the purely online leaning (POL) group that merely received an online instruction. All learners delivered four argumentative essay writing pre-tests, performed the WebQuest tasks, engaged in pair\/group works, completed all the sub-tasks, and finally wrote four essays as post-tests. The results of paired-samples t-tests revealed that EFL learners' achievement in writing skill as a whole and writing sub-skills improved significantly from pre-tests to post-tests in all the WML, EVBL, and POL groups. The mentioned finding was vindicated considering the peculiar characteristic of EFL learners and the distinctive nature of TEIs. In addition, the results of one-way between-groups ANOVA indicated that WML and EVBL groups outperformed the POL group in the overall writing achievement, which was explained in the light of technology-related dimension, the interaction dimension, and the conventional perspective of education dimension. The presented findings can provide insights for stakeholders to incorporate more TEIs in developing EFL contexts.","subject":"Web Based Instruction, Blended Learning, Electronic Learning, English (Second Language), Writing Achievement, Foreign Countries, Writing Skills, Second Language Learning","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Iran"},{"title":"An Online Course on Applied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology through Case-Based Learning","author":"Plasencia, Javier","description":"An undergraduate online course on Applied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology was developed through different formats of case study that included lecture, class discussion, small-groups discussion, and individual work.

This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional &quot;outside of the computer&quot; activities to strengthen students' engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis, including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys' engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls' motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity.","subject":"STEM Education, Disproportionate Representation, Females, Program Design, Program Implementation, Skill Development, Career Pathways, Learner Engagement, Youth, Career Awareness, Student Motivation, Inclusion, Gender Issues","source":"Smart Learning Environments","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Adjusting to Linguistic Diversity in a Primary School through Relational Agency and Expertise: A Mother-Tongue Teacher Team&apos;s Perspective","author":"Hedman, Christina, Magnusson, Ulrika","description":"This paper explores the role of collaborative teacher agency in facilitating translingual adjustments in a linguistically diverse primary school in Sweden. We focus on three multicompetent language teachers, who taught minoritized languages in the marginalized Mother Tongue (MT) subject, Modern Languages, and offered Multilingual Study Mentoring. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork, including teacher interviews and fieldnotes from everyday MT practices and preparations for an annual musical performance, we investigated how the teachers adjusted to the students' multilingual repertoires through &quot;relational agency&quot; and &quot;distributed expertise&quot; (Edwards, A. 2011. Building common knowledge at the boundaries between professional practices: Relational agency and relational expertise in systems of distributed expertise. &quot;International Journal of Educational Research&quot; 50(1). 33-39). These adjustments affected the offered language provisions beyond what was required, based on students' linguistic competencies and parental involvement. Didactic adjustments also afforded migrant students literary experiences that starkly contrasted with the limited literacy content in beginner courses in Swedish. These &quot;responsive professional actions&quot; (Edwards, A. 2011. Building common knowledge at the boundaries between professional practices: Relational agency and relational expertise in systems of distributed expertise. &quot;International Journal of Educational Research&quot; 50(1). 33-39, p. 39) thus impacted on the students' opportunities for multilingual development, expanded language registers, including verbal art, and linguistic inclusion. Through these actions, language was reformulated as asset, and we find that &quot;an ethics of care&quot; (Watkins, M. 2011. Teachers' tears and the affective geography of the classroom. &quot;Emotion, Space and Society&quot; 4(3). 137-143) was closely intertwined with this relational agency.

Yet studies in the field have yielded inconsistent results in young elementary school students indicating a need to further examine this topic. This is particularly urgent for young children during the foundational years of early elementary school when they are learning critical academic skills including reading. Method: We examined the relationships between reading motivation, school-based well-being as covitality, and literacy achievement in 268 second graders in the process of reading acquisition in Hebrew. Well-being and reading motivation were examined by questionnaires designed and\/or adapted for young elementary school students and literacy skills by language and reading tests. Results: Findings showed a positive correlation between reading motivation and full-scale covitality scores, as well as most of its first order factors (gratitude, optimism, zest and persistence). Furthermore, both reading motivation and covitality were positively correlated to reading skills and language abilities. Significant differences were found between students with low-medium reading motivation and those with high motivation in all covitality subfactors and most literacy measures, in favour of children with high reading motivation. Conclusions: The worrisome picture, that children with low reading motivation also report low levels of covitality, suggests that proper attention should be paid throughout first grade to both reading motivation and school-based well-being, both of which might affect learning. Because children's cognitive readiness is related to their socioemotional well-being, children with poor language abilities and emergent literacy skills may require special support to prevent their expected reading difficulties and the negative emotions attached to them. Thus, designing reading instruction programmes that implement motivational aspects should be a high priority interest for educators that teach young children.","subject":"Elementary School Students, Grade 2, Reading Motivation, Well Being, Correlation, Reading Achievement, Reading Skills, Student Characteristics, Language Skills, Emergent Literacy, Reading Difficulties, Reading Instruction, Mental Health","source":"Journal of Research in Reading","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Challenges and Opportunities for Expatriate Faculty Teaching Graduation Seminar Classes in Japanese Universities","author":"Hawkes, Martin, Adamson, Calum","description":"This paper considers the issues facing expatriate instructors teaching English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) graduation seminars\u00a0(commonly\u00a0known as the &quot;zemi&quot; in Japan) in Japanese universities and aims to establish better conditions to build Communities of Practice.\u00a0Since the term &quot;graduation seminar&quot; is widely used globally, and might lead to preconceptions from readers, zemi is the term that will be used in this paper as a common example of Japanese English.

With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense-making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross-national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video-based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model-based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., &quot;construction,&quot; &quot;use,&quot; &quot;evaluation,&quot; and &quot;revision&quot; of scientific models) in regular, day-to-day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model &quot;construction&quot; more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions\/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores--despite a complete lack of model &quot;evaluation&quot; and &quot;revision&quot; in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in &quot;both&quot; nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices. Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena, constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science\/deliver content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g., inquiry-based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis on actualizing modeling as an authentic &quot;sense-making&quot; endeavor.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Comparative Education, Science Education, Models, Elementary School Science, Science Instruction, Teaching Methods, Scores, Inquiry, Instructional Effectiveness, Authentic Learning","source":"Science Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United States, Germany"},{"title":"Developing a Model for Interdisciplinary Collaboration for STEM Graduate Students","author":"Kim, Eun Gyong, Baldwin, Matthew, Shin, Aeri, Peyton, Carter, Fanguy, Mik","description":"For English as a foreign language (EFL) graduate students in STEM, with the need to publish in an international journal comes the double burden of developing general English language skills and discipline-specific writing skills.

This study investigates how discipline-specific SW courses were developed for graduate students at a Korean science and engineering university, if the courses were successfully implemented, and what could be done to improve the offering of such courses. The study uses a mixed methods research design, informed by the research paradigm of pragmatism. The dataset used in the present study includes interviews, questionnaire surveys, and performance measurement. Interviews were conducted with six language and five content professors and nine teaching assistants, and 42 students involved in the development and offering of the SW courses. A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting interviewees. In addition, two types of questionnaire surveys were conducted among the students who had taken the courses: 225 participated in the university survey and 312 in the program survey. In addition, a pretest and posttest were given to measure students' improvement in their SW performances. For data analysis, text analysis and descriptive statistics were used. The results show that the courses were well received by all those involved. Students expressed appreciation for their instructor's individual attention and feedback on their writing. Moreover, students' posttest scores showed substantial improvement. On the other hand, the study raises such issues as difficulties in collaboration between the language and content professors and the need to enhance the course's relevance to students' major fields.

Using extracts from a practitioner study conducted in a high school EFL classroom in Shanghai, this paper illustrates how different linguistic and semiotic resources are deployed in a teacher's and students' translanguaging practices in order to achieve pedagogical goals, thus demonstrating the possibilities that pedagogical translanguaging encompasses. The paper argues that practitioners should be encouraged to make full use of these resources so as to create arenas of opportunity for the students.","subject":"High School Students, Teaching Methods, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Usage, Code Switching (Language), Foreign Countries, Semiotics, Classroom Communication, Chinese, Teacher Student Relationship, Language Teachers","source":"ELT Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"China (Shanghai)"},{"title":"The Intersection of Perceptions of Classroom Openness with Civic Engagement among Young Urban Adolescents in Science Classroom","author":"Wui, Ma.

Survey data including student perceptions of classroom openness, which indicates perceived levels of social and political discussions in the classroom, and personal characteristics such as gender, science engagement, and English Learner (EL) status were collected in 6th-grade science classrooms in an urban intermediate school. Civic engagement was measured using the personally responsible and participatory types of citizenship. Results from hierarchical linear regressions showed that student perceptions of classroom openness uniquely predicted the personally responsible citizen but not participatory citizen after controlling for personal characteristics. Science engagement and gender were significant predictors of both citizenship types.

The insight of the intelligibility principle has greatly impressed researchers in China's English education, but has &quot;very limited and weak&quot; impacts on English pronunciation teaching and learning in China. English education in China has been systematically conducted from schools to universities under the direction of national syllabi and curriculum standards issued by the Ministry of Education. Using the documentary research method, this paper, the first try of its kind, takes a historical look at China's national syllabi and curriculum standards for schools issued after 1949, focusing on the conception of the nature and the role of pronunciation and pronunciation teaching, pronunciation goals, teacher's role, as well as requirements or suggestions about what to teach and how to teach. By tracing the process of developments in pronunciation teaching notions and principles that were and\/or are officially advocated in China, the paper reveals two important facts. First, the English national syllabi and curriculum standards have encompassed both the nativeness principle and the intelligibility principle, though implicitly giving dominance to the former one, which in part accounts for the favor for the nativeness principle in formal English education, especially in schools, in China. Second, with the notion of English as a lingua franca adopted in the syllabi and curriculum standards, the intelligibility principle has been gaining more and more weight. Consequently, by elaborating that the two principles are by nature not incompatible, it is proposed that the current curriculum standards go further to take balanced attitudes towards the two principles so as to lead Chinese English teachers and students to set more realistic and instrumental-pragmatic pronunciation goals in line with varying English learning purposes. The findings and the proposal could be adopted by teachers and learners so as to change the school reality and may shed light on future relevant revisions of the current national English curriculum standards, teaching material development, teacher training, and pronunciation teaching methodology research.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Pronunciation Instruction, Intelligibility, National Curriculum, Standards, Educational History, Pronunciation, Language Role, Learning Processes, Educational Objectives, Language Attitudes, Language Variation, Native Speakers","source":"Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"title":"Gathering Rich Data on Preservice Science Teachers&apos; Pedagogical Content Knowledge through Their Lesson Plans","author":"Kaya, Zehra, Nafiz Kaya, Osman","description":"The purpose of this study was to, first, examine the potential of lesson plans (LPs) of preservice science teachers (PSTs, N = 631) as a source for gathering rich data on their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and, second, qualitatively describe PSTs' reasons for the level of data richness in their LPs on PCK.

Researchers often attribute deficit talk by mathematics teachers (MTs) to their biased beliefs and perceptions. From an interactional approach, namely conversation analysis and discursive psychology, I offer an alternative perspective on how deficit talk is produced in PD interactions. The analysis shows the rhetorical functions of deficit talk, which are designed for MTs to manage their accountability with a range of potential issues and to portray themselves as competent teachers. The analysis also reveals the action-performing nature of deficit talk (e.g., refusing a request) situated in the social interaction. To conclude, this paper suggests that mathematics teacher educators need to attend to the micropolitical nature of deficit talk and their co-participation in the production of deficit talk as they formulate ways to respond to deficit talk in PD interactions.","subject":"Faculty Development, Mathematics Teachers, Mathematics Instruction, Self Concept, Equal Education, Teacher Attitudes, Discourse Analysis, Disadvantaged, Accountability, Teacher Competencies, Teacher Effectiveness, Teacher Educators","source":"Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Beyond Questions: A Fellowship of Opportunities for Fostering Preschoolers&apos; Story Comprehension","author":"Collins, Molly F.","description":"Much attention has been paid to storybook reading as a context for supporting preschoolers' emergent language and literacy.

This allows its application to be extended to further training areas as well as constituting an effective approach for need analysis and a preparatory action for numerous training activities (guided discussion with experts, observation on practice, modeling, etc.).","subject":"Inservice Teacher Education, Elementary School Teachers, Secondary School Teachers, Early Childhood Teachers, Feedback (Response), Automation, Teacher Attitudes, Cognitive Processes, Beliefs, Teacher Effectiveness, Teacher Behavior, Learning Processes, Individualized Instruction, Foreign Countries","source":"Research on Education and Media","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Italy"},{"title":"Classroom Practices and Peer Social Status in Junior High School","author":"Di Stasio, Maria Rosaria, Savage, Robert","description":"This study investigates the association between classroom practices and individual social status outcomes in junior high.

To investigate gender-related effects in biology education, a sample of 303 sixth-grade students (M[subscript age] = 11.31\u00a0years, SD[subscript age] = 0.58\u00a0years) participated in a 3-h teaching unit on harvest mice that was taught in either an autonomy-supportive or controlling manner. The results revealed a significant effect of the treatment on self-determined motivation, with the effect being stronger for the boys. In the treatment with controlling teaching behavior, gender-related differences in self-determined motivation became apparent. In contrast, the gender gap was mainly smaller in the treatment with autonomy-supportive teaching behavior. Thus, the results suggest that satisfying the need for autonomy appears to be an effective means to help bridge the gender gap in biology lessons.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Science Instruction, Biology, Gender Differences, Self Determination, Personal Autonomy, Grade 6, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Student Motivation","source":"European Journal of Psychology of Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Germany"},{"title":"Finding &quot;Otherness&quot; in Music and Pedagogy: A Critical Ontological Analysis of an Immersive International Music Education Exchange Program","author":"McBride, Nicholas R., Nicholson, George","description":"This study sought to investigate how a cohort of American preservice graduate students in music education reconceptualize their pedagogical lens after participating in an immersive cultural music exchange program in China.

J., Savelsbergh, E. R., van Joolingen, W.

In secondary education, the introduction of SRT could provide a great opportunity for students to engage in physics theorizing, but this opportunity is largely being missed in current teaching practice. One reason could be that secondary students lack some knowledge of electromagnetism that was central to Einstein's argument. Therefore, we conducted an educational reconstruction to develop a teaching approach that would not rely on advanced understanding of electromagnetism, yet retain the modes of reasoning that were characteristic of Einstein's approach. In our reconstruction, we identified the light postulate, which is notoriously difficult for students to grasp, as a central concept. We developed a teaching and learning sequence in which students perform relativistic thought experiments and try different interpretations of the light postulate. Through these activities, students experienced how the new concepts meet the requirements for a good theory. Experimental evaluation of the teaching and learning sequence indicates that this can be a fruitful approach to introduce SRT to secondary students.","subject":"Physics, Scientific Concepts, Secondary School Science, Science Education, Science Process Skills, Magnets, Science Instruction, Teaching Methods, Science Experiments, Science Activities, Light","source":"Science & Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Word and Child Characteristics in Vocabulary Learning of Native English Speakers and Bilingual Learners","author":"Zhang, Jie, Lo, Meng-Ting, Lin, Tzu-Jung","description":"This study investigated how word and child characteristics affect children's ability to learn the meanings of novel words.

Using postqualitative methods, this analysis addresses two framing questions: How does turning attention towards the unfolding relations in a writing class illuminate some possibilities of response-able pedagogies? What becomes possible when the teaching of writing emphasises 'becoming' (rather than products\/achievement)? In response to the first question, turning attention towards the unfolding relations in the class context made new ways of conceptualising writing possible: writing as following energies; writing as making; and writing as producing\/traversing boundaries. Considered together, these interwoven practices contributed to the response-able pedagogy of writing-as-becoming. In response to question two, the response-able pedagogy of writing-as-becoming shifted the teaching emphasis from controlled outcomes to the affective experience of connection.

This study investigated how pedagogical documentation was used and adopted among professionals in Finnish ECEC in the wake of a new normative curriculum in 2016 that made pedagogical documentation mandatory. Theoretically, the study is based on educational research that has a close affinity to the Reggio Emilia approach to documentation. The empirical data (N = 135) was derived from a questionnaire that was sent out to ECEC centres in one larger municipality in Finland. Our empirical data was examined using a mix of quantitative and qualitative content analysis.

Barthes's concept helps students to recalibrate the value of an author's biography and the author's interpretation when analyzing a text. Just such a power recalibration takes place for teen characters in Green's &quot;The Fault in Our Stars.&quot; Hazel, the protagonist, demonstrates sharp literary critique informed by Barthes's theory when she engages with most texts. However, she initially rejects the Death of the Author approach when it comes to interpreting one idolized piece of literature: her favorite novel.

A wide range of adverse childhood events--including physical, verbal, emotional, and sexual abuse; chronic bullying; community or domestic violence; and food and housing insecurity--can lead to a host of negative outcomes. However, when schools provide developmentally supportive responses to these challenges, post-traumatic growth becomes possible. In &quot;Trauma Responsive Educational Practices,&quot; Micere Keels examines the neurobiology of trauma; presents mindfulness strategies that strengthen student self-regulation and extend professional longevity; and demonstrates how to build pedagogically caring relationships, psychologically safe discipline, and an emotionally safe classroom learning climate. Keels also shows educators how to attend to equity and use trauma as a critical lens through which to plan instruction and respond to challenging situations with coregulation. It's important to understand that trauma is subjective and complex, treatment is not prescriptive, and recovery takes time. This book helps educators support students on that road--not merely to survive trauma but to focus on their strengths and flourish with effective coping skills.","subject":"Trauma, Trauma Informed Approach, Educational Practices, Student Needs, Coping, Metacognition, Caring, Safety, Classroom Environment, Teacher Student Relationship, Equal Education, Social Support Groups, Learning","source":"ASCD","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Effects of and Preference for Student- and Teacher-Implemented Good Behavior Game in Early Elementary Classes","author":"Peltier, William, Newell, Kristen L., Linton, Elizabeth, Holmes, Sarah C., Donaldson, Jeanne M.","description":"Disruptive behavior during instruction is a common problem in elementary classrooms.

The effects of the GBG on disruptive behavior and peer interactions were evaluated using a combined reversal and multielement design. Student preference for conditions was assessed via a group arrangement of a concurrent-chains preference assessment. All versions of the game reduced disruptive behavior compared to baseline, but the rate of disruptive behavior was slightly higher during the teacher-implemented sessions in Class 1. Few peer interactions occurred during the game; however, negative interactions increased slightly in both classes during the GBG. Students overwhelmingly preferred the student-implemented version of the game.

The advent of personalized EdTech, which automatically tailor learning environments to individual learners, gives renewed relevance to the topic. EdTech researchers and practitioners are confronted with the same basic question: What is the right amount of agency to give to learners during their interactions with EdTech? This question is even more relevant for younger learners. Our aim in this paper is twofold: First, we outline and synthesize the ways in which agency is conceptualized in three key learning disciplines (philosophy, education, and psychology). We show that there are different types and levels of agency and various prerequisites for the effective exercise of agency and that these undergo developmental change.

Methodologically, we explore the affordances of CAE in combining internal and community dialogues to make sense of our identities, which are situated at the nexus of the personal and the cultural. Each one of us describes and analyzes one major tension that has been part of our professional identity negotiation as TESOL practitioners in the US. Addressing our research question, we conceptually argued that tensions are inevitable in our identity work and found that border-crossing and in-betweenness predominantly characterized our identities as TTPs. We cross borders and carve out in-between spaces, identities, and voices for ourselves in our professional lives.","subject":"Language Teachers, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Professional Identity, Teacher Attitudes, Teacher Collaboration, Ethnography, Cultural Differences","source":"TESOL Quarterly: A Journal for Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages and of Standard English as a Second Dialect","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Generation Z Goes to Math Class: How the Effective Mathematics Teaching Practices Can Support a New Generation of Learners","author":"Marin, Katherine Ariemma, White, Stephanie J.","description":"Middle and high school students are part of Generation Z (birth years 1997-2012), a group that is emerging as very different from their parents and teachers. This article considers ways that generational research about Generation Z learners and NCTM's Effective Mathematics Teaching Practices can be used to inform and innovate practice in the mathematics classroom. Research suggests that while Generation Z learners are digitally engaged, they often display a lack of tech savvy. Generation Z students thrive on personalization and are often uncomfortable with collaborative learning. And the social movements of the early 2000s have shaped their world view. The authors provide resources, such as real-world tasks rooted in social problems, and instructional suggestions for teachers. Teachers who consider the characteristics and preferences of Generation Z in their planning can enact mathematics lessons that better connect to Generation Z learners. With the Effective Mathematics Teaching Practices as a guide, teachers can design and deliver innovative lessons that support Generation Z learners to promote deeper understanding of mathematical content.","subject":"Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Age Groups, Instructional Design, Lesson Plans, Instructional Innovation, Middle School Students, High School Students, Digital Literacy, Student Characteristics, Preferences, Instructional Effectiveness","source":"School Science and Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Mathematics and Science Teacher Educators&apos; Use of Representations of Practice: A Mixed Methods Study","author":"Austin, Christine K., Kosko, Karl W., Heisler, Jennifer L.","description":"This study sought to explore math and science teacher educators' use of various media to represent practice within methods courses. There is little understanding of why certain media is used over other representations and the rationale for these choices. Specifically, the study focused on the prevalence and familiarity of teacher educators with comics and animations, standard videos, and 360 videos. This mixed methods study utilized a survey and interviews to ascertain math and science teacher educators' level of familiarity and perceived usefulness of representations of practice. Results indicate that standard video is by far the most used representation of practice in methods classes with three themes explaining this finding: access to representations of practice, dimensions of representation, and pertinacity of using representations. Familiarity with representations of practice relates to teacher educators' perceptions of access thereby indicating a need for teacher educators to have better access to representations. Implications of this study include supporting current literature about the relationship between the level of familiarity and perceived usefulness in media along with the potential need for a central platform that houses these representations of practice resources for teacher educators.","subject":"Mathematics Teachers, Science Teachers, Teacher Educators, Multimedia Materials, Multimedia Instruction, Methods Courses, Familiarity, Video Technology","source":"School Science and Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Development, Factor Structure, and Reliability of the Shared Instructional Leadership Scale in Public Secondary Schools","author":"Zhan, Xi, Anthony, Anika B., Goddard, Roger, Beard, Karen Stansberry","description":"Shared instructional leadership may support informed decision making on matters of curriculum, instruction, and assessment.

Reading difficulties and disabilities are commonly found in this population. Nonetheless, speech disfluencies have not been explored in adult struggling readers (ASRs). In the current study, we examined the rate of stuttering in ASRs as well as the relationships between their speech fluency and reading skills. A total of 120 participants were interviewed about their experiences with reading and administered standardized reading and reading-related assessments. Speech fluency and the criterion for stuttering were based on the interview. About 18.3% of the sample met the criterion for stuttering. ASRs who stutter (ASRs-S) and ASRs who do not stutter (ASRs-NS) did not differ in their reading and reading-related skills. ASRs-S had higher rates of negative correlations between reading and reading-related skills compared with ASRs-NS. Correlation patterns between performance on standardized assessments point to higher rates of uneven skills or dissociations in ASRs-S. These findings may have implications for the assessment and instruction for ASRs.

This exploratory study was to examine the salient patterns problem solvers demonstrated using MERs when they engaged in a single-player, three-dimensional architecture game that requires the acquisition and application of math knowledge and thinking in game-based context problem solving. We recorded and systematically coded the behaviors of using MERs demonstrated by 20 university students during 1.5 hours of gameplay.

Overall, the teachers showed high levels of awareness of the benefits of oral corrective feedback. They nominated pronunciation errors as the most important target for correction in the primary context. In practice, although pronunciation and grammar accounted for the majority of the total errors, leading to the majority of total feedback moves, the frequency of feedback per error was much higher for vocabulary errors. Prompts were reported by teachers to be more effective and more favourable than reformulations, but this preference was not reflected in the classroom observations, in which a large number of didactic recasts were used. The observed discrepancies are interpreted in relation to contextual factors and the influence of different sets of beliefs on practices.

As the field of language learning motivation seeks to develop frameworks for motivational teaching practice, a richer understanding of learners' individuality is crucial in shaping practices that respond to learners' needs. The present study examines the role of learners' personality and teachers' practice in shaping motivation and self-efficacy in language learning. Drawing on data gathered from 277 learners of English in Hong Kong, aged 11-14 years, and 24 lesson observations, across 10 classes, the study applies hierarchical multiple regression analysis to reveal a significant role of personality and teachers' motivational practice in predicting language learning motivation and self-efficacy.

Four parents from different families whose children were between the ages of four to five participated in this study. These parents were interviewed about their experience and history of using technology and their thoughts about technology as a tool for language and cultural learning. Four narratives were constructed to describe parents' experiences, histories, opinions, cultural values and beliefs. Parents' perspectives were influenced by a variety of intertwined factors, including their own childhood language learning experiences, their histories of using technology, their cultural values and beliefs about learning, the purpose of technological experiences, and the quality of available technological resources.

Explorative routines in this theorisation may refer not to inquiry-based activity but to the result of a student's routine moving from being process-oriented to becoming outcome-oriented, a deritualisation. Choice of tasks as well as a teacher's moves offer students different opportunities to engage in rituals, explorative routines and deritualisations. Through nuancing the space spanned by opportunities to engage in rituals and explorative routines respectively, we describe and contrast classroom practices in three lessons from three contexts. The lessons share a commonality in encouraging explorative routines as a starting point, yet being adapted towards ritual activity through decreased openings for student agentivity, fewer invitations for students' own substantiations or both. We argue that such adaptations are driven by the teachers' commitment to reach mathematical closure in a lesson, to balance considerations of the classroom community and individual students and to meet curricular requirements.

To address this issue, we integrate findings from psycholinguistics and educational sciences in order to identify how effective pedagogical practices for monolingual children can be extended to pedagogical practices for bilingual children. We show that both monolingual and bilingual children benefit from teaching strategies that strengthen the mental connections between semantically and phonologically related words, and that for bilingual children, these strategies should support both within- and cross-language connections. We argue that by stimulating the use of the home language in the classroom, translanguaging strategies like multilingual label quests and multilingual reading and writing can strengthen cross-language connections and, thereby, facilitate cross-linguistic lexical transfer. For closely related languages, stimulation of the home language has the additional benefit of implicitly facilitating the transfer of cognate vocabulary.

Overall, individual trajectories for respectful behavior and rule-following behavior were not dependent on classroom groupings. However, across behaviors and settings, classroom norms significantly predicted individual behavior. These findings extend classroom norms research into an EBD setting and suggest that classroom norms may promote or inhibit positive behavior within self-contained classrooms for students with EBD.

Our contribution has the aim of showing that basic mental models about exponential growth are important for understanding media reports of COVID-19. Furthermore, we highlight how the coronavirus pandemic can be used as a context in mathematics classrooms to help students understand that they can and should question media reports on their own, using their mathematical knowledge. Therefore, we first present the role of mathematical modelling in achieving these goals in general. The same relevance applies to the necessary basic mental models of exponential growth. Following this description, based on three topics, namely, investigating the type of growth, questioning given course models, and determining exponential factors at different times, we show how the presented theoretical aspects manifest themselves in teaching examples when students are given the task of reflecting critically on existing media reports. Finally, the value of the three topics regarding the intended goals is discussed and conclusions concerning the possibilities and limits of their use in schools are drawn.","subject":"Mathematical Models, Mathematical Concepts, COVID-19, Pandemics, Mathematics Instruction, Critical Thinking, Mass Media","source":"ZDM: Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Q?uality of Teaching Practices for All Students: Multilevel Analysis of Language-Responsive Teaching for Robust Understanding","author":"Neugebauer, Philipp, Prediger, Susanne","description":"The quality of curriculum resources and teaching practices can constrain or promote students' opportunities for mathematics learning, in particular, students with diverse language proficiency.

Given that such closures are justified public health measures, this raises the question of compensating children for school closures. In this article I address the question of compensation from the perspective of a popular theory of justice: luck egalitarianism. In doing so, I examine a problem with applying luck egalitarianism to children, called the agency assumption. I then argue this assumption results in a dilemma for luck egalitarianism and suggest how this dilemma can be overcome. I argue that the resulting form of luck egalitarianism reveals something interesting about compensating children for school closures: luck egalitarianism requires us to address all bases of justice-relevant inequality among children--COVID-19-related and beyond. Although much of the current discussion of compensating children for such closures has focused narrowly on the need to make up for lost instruction time or to prevent reductions in educational achievement, I argue that a luck egalitarian conception of justice requires us to go beyond merely compensating children for educational losses and instead aim for radical equality in education.","subject":"COVID-19, Pandemics, School Closing, Equal Education, Social Justice, Academic Achievement, Access to Education, Educational Change, Social Differences, Elementary Secondary Education","source":"Studies in Philosophy and Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Exploring Student Teachers&apos; Perceptions of Assessment Ethics across University-Based Teacher Education Programs in Iran","author":"Darabi Bazvand, Ali","description":"It is acknowledged that assessment ethics is an integral part of teacher education. Unlike sizable published research on students' perceptions of assessment in higher education, very little is reported on student teachers' perceptions of assessment ethics across university-based teacher education programs. This study aimed to explore Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) student teachers' perceptions of assessment ethics in the classroom. Qualitative (phone interview) data from 15 TEFL teacher candidates were collected and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Based on the informants' responses, three overarching issues in assessment ethics emerged and are namely related to (a) assessment development (i.e., content underrepresentation, one-dimensional assessment, surprise items), (b) assessment administration(i.e., time, noise, and inconsistency in educators' behaviors), and (c) assessment scoring and communication (i.e., lack of transparency in feedback provision' 'misalignment of grading practice,' and 'breaching confidentiality in grade communication'). Furthermore, it was revealed that assessment is, for a great part, teacher-initiated and summative-oriented.

These efficacy beliefs are open to change during initial teacher education and become more resistant to change once the teacher enters the workforce. Therefore, it is important to measure mathematics teacher efficacy early in initial teacher education and identify low efficacy beliefs. This study measured the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of 402 prospective primary teachers. Arising from Rasch analysis of the efficacy scores of these teachers, 22 participants who displayed a range of mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs were interviewed to gain insights into factors affecting these beliefs. Participants communicated greater confidence in tasks requiring procedural (tell-items) than conceptual knowledge (explain-items). Both low and high efficacy participants reported traditional experiences of mathematics teaching and learning as students. However, high efficacy participants reported mastery of mathematics within these traditional contexts, whereas their low efficacy peers did not report mastery. Furthermore, all participants reported how memories of their school mathematics experiences informed their level of efficacy when thinking about teaching mathematics, thus revealing the powerful influence of mastery experiences.","subject":"Preservice Teachers, Elementary School Teachers, Teacher Effectiveness, Mathematics Instruction, Self Efficacy, Self Concept Measures, Attitude Change, Knowledge Level","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Education [Bildung]-Literality-Competence: On Competing Tasks of Public Schools and the Need for New Links between Teaching and Educational Research","author":"Benner, Dietrich","description":"Purpose: The article distinguishes between the three concepts of standardization of the tasks of pedagogical action in modern educational systems: the traditional concept of standardizing educational goals through curricula, the literacy concept of psychometric standardization, and the concept of competence, which can be developed in different ways.

Our inductive and deductive approach to analyze 12 students' 132 journal entries during a TESOL methods class showed developing understandings of translanguaging theory and pedagogy influenced by (a) experience with theories of bilingualism grounded in language separation as historically understood in TESOL, (b) tensions regarding the application of translanguaging theory to praxis (Li, 2017), and (c) tensions between language and testing within the context of neoliberalism (Zeichner, 2014) guiding language teaching and learning in the K-16 context.

In this study, we investigated how teachers reasoned proportionally on a nonroutine ratio task and the extent to which their proportional reasoning was able to predict their overall understanding of the relevant concepts: ratios and proportional relationships. Using data collected from 238 US mathematics teachers, we found that teachers' proportional reasoning could be grouped into four categories: incorrect, additive, relative, and proportional reasoning.

The contextual factor of DOI was found to be significantly influential in the TPACK of EFL teachers. Such an effect was negatively related to the technological knowledge of the EFL teachers; however, it was not significantly related to their pedagogical and content knowledge. The possible reasons are discussed accordingly followed by theoretical and practical implications entailed in this study.","subject":"Technology Integration, Technological Literacy, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Context Effect, Language Teachers, Administrator Attitudes, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Hierarchical Linear Modeling, Correlation","source":"Asia-Pacific Education Researcher","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"title":"Capturing Variations in How Spelling Is Taught in Primary School Classrooms in England","author":"Esposito, Rosanne, Herbert, Elisabeth, Sumner, Emma","description":"Mastering spelling is important for children to progress in writing. The National Curriculum in England details spelling lists linked to each year group in primary education. Assessment practices also emphasise the importance of teaching spelling. However, to date, little is known about how teachers feel about teaching spelling nor the instructional methods that they use in primary schools in England. This study addresses this gap by investigating approaches to teaching spelling. An online survey was distributed to primary-based teaching staff with roles in supporting teaching and learning. The survey asked for information about the respondents' teaching experience and school setting, and about their attitudes and approach to teaching spelling. The survey was completed in full by 158 respondents. Approaches to teaching spelling were varied and over two-thirds of the sample highlighted that their school did not have a spelling policy. The importance of explicit teaching of spelling was supported by the majority of teachers. This judgement was more frequent and rated more highly by teachers supporting younger children. Teachers largely reported devising their own spelling resources, highlighted that the curriculum spelling lists lack guidance for teaching spelling strategies and questioned their suitability for pupils of varying abilities. A range of spelling programmes and strategies were recorded. The findings provide insight into universal instructional approaches. Practical implications for teacher training and professional development are discussed.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Spelling, Elementary School Teachers, Teaching Methods, Teaching Experience, School Policy, Direct Instruction","source":"British Educational Research Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom (England)"},{"title":"Transcending Borders: The International Baccalaureate&apos;s Systemic Approach to Educating the Whole Person. Case Study","author":"Hegseth, Whitney","description":"The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) endeavors to promote both challenging academic instruction and more holistic aims--namely, intercultural understanding and respect. Throughout its history, the IB system has managed at least three ongoing tensions, which stem from its multifaceted aims and which the system has evolved to manage. These three tensions are between: (1) academic rigor and equitable access; (2) more traditional academic achievement and more holistic teaching and learning; and (3) providing supports to schools and teachers to promote fidelity of implementation and also permitting practitioners enough discretion for local adaptation. These tensions are especially apparent at three points in time throughout the IB system's reform journey: when IB began in the 1960s, when the Primary Years Programme was created in 1997, and when the PYP was enhanced in 2018. As enduring as these tensions may be, the IB system also offers policymakers lessons on how to manage them.

Such policy reform has been constructed in relation to a perceived gap in research about knowledge of the best way to educate or train new teachers. Using Lee S. Shulman's concept of signature pedagogies we consider the varying ways in which theoretical ideas are underpinned by common models of, and approaches to, teacher education pedagogy. We mobilise Shulman to analyse five models, which we categorise as 'knowledge-first' or 'people-first', to see the extent to which, if at all, there is a theoretically informed signature pedagogy for initial teacher education. Our analysis shows that there is no one discernible knowledge base or theory that underpins a signature pedagogy for teacher education, but a suite of possibilities about how a signature pedagogy of teacher education could be understood. Moreover, it is our contention that policy reform of initial teacher education based on econometric analysis fails to recognise the most important dimension of a signature pedagogy, learning how to act with integrity as a professional teacher.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Teacher Education, Instruction, Educational Policy, Educational Change, Integrity, Professional Identity, Professionalism, Educational Objectives, Teaching (Occupation), Teacher Education Curriculum, Schools of Education","source":"London Review of Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom (England)"},{"title":"Experiencing Autonomous Futures: Engaged Learning with Next Generation Technology","author":"Kassens-Noor, Eva, Durst, Noah, Decaminada, Travis, Parcell, Jake","description":"Digital software has been proliferating in the classroom, frequently replacing students' hands on experiences.

This study examines the potential impact of hands on experiences on student knowledge, skills, and values regarding emerging technology in the context of a course that employed traditional learning, defined as theoretical applications of next generation technology, namely autonomous vehicles during the first half, and hands on experiences with physical emerging technologies related to domotics, during the second half. Using three diagnostics, tweets, reflections, and discussion posts, we suggest that hands on experiences allowed students to more easily identify potential challenges with, and reduced their fears regarding, emerging technology. Additionally, our findings suggest that traditional learning methods may decrease familiarity with most technologies, whereas hands on experiences increased familiarity. Hands on experiences also appear to reverse several other trends associated with traditional learning. Ultimately, given the proliferation of technologies in the modern world and the impacts of automation, hands on experiences may be even more valuable than expected to students as they enter the workforce.","subject":"Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Robotics, Experiential Learning, Familiarity, Photography, Equipment, Telecommunications, Handheld Devices, Graduate Students, Conventional Instruction, Transportation","source":"Active Learning in Higher Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"A Synthesis of the Conceptualization and Measurement of Implementation Fidelity in Mathematics Intervention Research","author":"Bos, Samantha E., Powell, Sarah R., Maddox, Steven A., Doabler, Christian T.","description":"In intervention studies, high rates of &quot;implementation fidelity&quot; are important markers of a study's success; however, the definition of implementation fidelity is both complex and dynamic. In this synthesis, we examined the dimensions of implementation fidelity measured and reported in 99 studies in which researchers utilized a mathematics intervention for elementary students (i.e., Grades 1-5). We examined implementation fidelity following recommendations made by Dane and Schneider (1998), O'Donnell (2008), and DeFouw et al. (2009) to capture a comprehensive representation of the implementation fidelity data collected and reported within mathematics intervention studies. We organized our conceptualization of implementation fidelity into four overarching categories and nine dimensions within those categories: intervention design (i.e., theories of change and logistics), fidelity of implementor (i.e., adherence, quality of delivery, dosage, and implementor knowledge or experience), student engagement, and treatment analysis (i.e., treatment differentiation and analysis of implementation fidelity). Overall, findings indicate many author teams reported adherence data and dosage data, but significantly fewer studies reported quality of delivery data, student engagement data, or treatment differentiation data. In addition, author teams were more likely to report at least one form of logistics, such as implementor support, than theories of change.

The study draws on the voices of teachers and Japanese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) who encountered difficulties or dilemmas in L2 interaction due to cross-culturally different interactional rules. It focuses on developing L2 learners' repair strategies to enhance their interactional repertoires in relation to the reasons behind classroom silence. The study regards silence and learner-initiated repair as intertwined interactional resources frequently occurring within the same sequence but with distinct functions. Silence functions as an interactional cue, preluding forthcoming repair, whereas repair practices can play a crucial role in the progress of interaction. CA-informed pedagogical approaches help learners to self-mediate classroom silence and thereby promote interaction, by encouraging them to use repair strategies. This study presents a framework for developing CA-informed material through a needs analysis, reflective observation of L2 interaction, and learner-initiated repair. It aims to raise awareness of essential interactional repertoires rarely explored in English language teaching (ELT) material design. It suggests that ELT material adopting CA perspectives can be an indispensable bridge mediating classroom interaction.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Error Correction, Classroom Communication, Needs Assessment, Teaching Methods, Discourse Analysis, Language Teachers, Cultural Differences, Cues, Material Development, Instructional Materials, Foreign Countries, Barriers, Student Participation","source":"TESOL Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Japan"},{"title":"Emotional Tensions as Rewards: An Emerging Teacher Leader&apos;s Identity Construction in EFL Textbook Development","author":"Gao, Yuan, Cui, Yaqiong","description":"Textbook development plays an important role in teacher development and educational reforms.

The construction of both roles may involve great efforts to manage challenges and tensions encountered during the textbook creation process. Grounded in the Douglas Fir Group's (2016) framework of multilayered complexity of language development and situated in a Chinese higher education context, this 3-year longitudinal case study examined how Gee, a newcomer in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teaching who also led the reform team, formed her identities as both an EAP teacher and a reform leader through her active tension engagement with an EAP textbook development process.

We examined the impact of task difficulty and supervision on whether participants would follow written instructions to use repeated testing over restudying. In Study 1, we found that when supervised, instructions to test resulted in changes in the self-regulated learning behaviors such that participants tested more often than they studied, relative to participants who were unsupervised during learning. This was true regardless of the task difficulty. In Study 2, we showed that failure to shift study strategies in unsupervised learning was likely due to participants avoidance of testing rather than failure to read the instructions at all. Participants who tested more frequently remembered more words later regardless of supervision or whether or not they received instructions to test, replicating the well-established testing effect (e.g., Dunlosky et al. in &quot;Psychol Sci Public Interest&quot; 14:4-58, 2013. http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/1529100612453266).

While research over the past three decades have documented pedagogical benefits of teaching mathematics using children's literature, research into teachers' perceptions regarding the use of such resources is virtually non-existent. The study thus filled this research gap by drawing responses from open-ended survey questions of 94 in-service and 82 pre-service teachers in Australia. A thematic analysis revealed 13 perceived barriers classified under five themes with Lack of Pedagogical Knowledge and Confidence, and Time Constraint, representing 75% of all perceived barriers. Moreover, 14 perceived enablers were identified and classified under five themes with Pedagogical Benefits and Love of Stories representing around 70% of all perceived enablers. Findings also showed that most of the teachers in the study (around 75%) never or infrequently used children's literature in their mathematics classrooms. The study highlights the role of professional learning and teacher training in ensuring that both in- and pre-service teachers have the necessary pedagogical knowledge, experience and confidence in using children's literature to enrich their mathematics teaching.","subject":"Elementary School Teachers, Preservice Teachers, Teacher Attitudes, Barriers, Affordances, Childrens Literature, Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Foreign Countries, Knowledge Level, Self Efficacy, Time","source":"Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"title":"University-Level EFL Students&apos; Views on Learning English Online: A Qualitative Study","author":"Okyar, Hatice","description":"The main aim of this article is to determine Turkish EFL (English as a foreign language) students' perceptions about learning English through distance education (henceforth DE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To realize this aim, the study adopted a qualitative research design and used the metaphor elicitation technique, semi-structured telephone interviews, and an online focus group interview to collect data. The results of the analysis show that most of the students prefer face-to-face English education in a classroom setting rather than online education. Despite some positive comments about DE like it being more comfortable for shy students, students' attitudes toward DE were found to be mostly negative because of the challenges they faced like technical problems, health and focus issues, a lack of interaction and speaking practice in the target language, feelings of anxiety and isolation and low motivation, and DE not addressing all learning styles effectively. Using several qualitative data collection tools, this study provides valuable insights into the thoughts and experiences of students about online English language learning, which can be taken into account to enhance future online language teaching and learning efforts.

It critiques dominant discourses and debates pertaining to multiculturalism and cultural identity, set against the current backdrop of growing social stratification and unequal access to quality education. It addresses current discourses concerning globalisation, ideologies and the state, as well as approaches to constructing national, ethnic and religious identities in the global culture. It explores the ambivalent and problematic connections between the state, globalisation, and the construction of cultural identity. The book also explores conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches applicable to research on the state, globalisation, multiculturalism and identity politics. Drawing on diverse paradigms, ranging from critical theory to globalisation, the book, by focusing on globalisation, ideology and cultural identity, critically examines recent research dealing with cultural diversity and its impact of identity politics. Given the need for a multiple perspective approach, the authors, who have diverse backgrounds and hail from different countries and regions, offer a wealth of insights, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the nexus between multiculturalism and national identity. With contributions from key scholars worldwide, the book should be required reading for a broad spectrum of users, including policy-makers, academics, graduate students, education policy researchers, administrators, and practitioners.","subject":"Cultural Pluralism, Global Approach, Self Concept, Cultural Awareness, Cultural Influences, Secondary School Curriculum, Civil Rights, Foreign Countries, Adult Education, History Instruction, Textbooks, Nationalism, Refugees, Social Networks, Student Motivation, Academic Achievement, Inclusion, Educational Research, Educational Trends","source":"Globalisation, Comparative Education and Policy Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Canada, Syria"},{"title":"Transforming Schools for Multilingual Learners: A Comprehensive Guide for Educators. 2nd Edition","author":"Zacarian, Debbie","description":"Much has changed in the ten years since this book was first published. A celebrated triumph, it provided state, district, school, and teacher leaders with a comprehensive guide to support multilingual learners to reach their full potential. From selecting the appropriate program model to partnering with families and infusing federal and state laws governing the education of multilingual learners and the rights of their families into all we do, the key messages that made the first edition of this book a renowned success have been re-examined in the second edition with a robust lens to meet these demanding times. This second edition supports educators to design and enact policies, practices, and structures for multilingual learners (MLs) to feel a sense of safety, belonging, value, and competence. Topics explored in the book include: (1) a discussion of the changes to federal and state policies and their impact on MLs and their families; (2) strategies to move from a deficit- to an asset-based approach that values multilingualism; (3) nine principles to design and deliver high-quality lessons in multiple languages and across disciplines; (4) practices to identify and support MLs with learning differences and disabilities; and (5) steps for building long-lasting family-school partnerships. Reflecting changing trends in leadership, this new edition supports superintendents, principals, curriculum supervisors, coaches, mentors, teachers, and other stakeholders in their collaborative efforts to create and sustain successful language assistance programs.

While the fields of bilingual education and disability studies have been traditionally kept separate, Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez argues that many of the constructs researchers and educators employ in their respective fields can be combined to improve instruction. This book establishes a dialogue among important constructs such as issues of assimilation and ableism, and the expansion of identity, agency, and humanistic pedagogies. It then looks at how these constructs can be used to better understand children who have been assigned inflexible labels that do not cohesively represent their bilingual\/bicultural identities and their varied ways of learning. The text explores the limitations of categorizing children into &quot;boxes,&quot; particularly those of minoritized backgrounds, and focuses on actual practices that will engage and empower learners. The book features: (1) Combines the fields of bilingual education and disability studies so that bilingual students with disabilities can be understood and taught from a strengths-based perspective; (2) Includes activity invitations to help teachers create high-quality learning spaces; (3) Provides sample work from diverse elementary school--aged children, as well as children's responses to the learning activity; (4) Proposes curriculum to expand what identity and agency look like in schools embracing more humanistic pedagogies.","subject":"Bilingual Students, Students with Disabilities, Elementary School Teachers, Elementary School Students, Labeling (of Persons), Minority Group Students, Student Needs, Learning Activities, Curriculum","source":"Teachers College Press","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Effect of Initial Design Experience on Students&apos; Development of Scientific Understanding","author":"Ladachart, Luecha, Radchanet, Visit, Phothong, Wilawan","description":"Background: In countries that endorse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education as an educational movement, design-based learning is deemed a pedagogical approach. Purpose: Because the integration of the engineering design process and scientific investigation has been an issue in science education, this study examined the effect of initial design experience on students' understanding of pulleys. Methodology\/Approach: We used quasi-experimental research, comparing two experimental groups with one control group in terms of their understanding of pulleys, measured by 10 multiple-choice conceptual questions. We used a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests to compare the groups prior to and after design-based learning. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare the pre- and postscores of each group. Findings\/Conclusions: The results indicate that, while the experimental groups did not have a better understanding of pulleys than the control group did in the pretest, they outperformed the control group in the posttest. Moreover, although the control group did not demonstrate a significant improvement, the experimental groups did so with large effect size. Implications: Based on the premises of experiential education, it is suggested that, for design-based activities to be effective, students should design using their prior knowledge before engaging in scientific investigation.","subject":"STEM Education, Teaching Methods, Comparative Analysis, Scientific Concepts, Concept Formation, Machine Tools, Design, Engineering, Science Instruction, Scores, Learning Activities, Prior Learning, Scientific Research, Multiple Choice Tests, Experiential Learning, Foreign Countries, Secondary School Students, Rural Areas","source":"Journal of Experiential Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Thailand"},{"title":"The Servants of Two Discourses: How Novice Facilitators Draw on Their Mathematics Teaching Experience","author":"Schwarts, Gil, Elbaum-Cohen, Avital, P\u00f6hler, Birte, Prediger, Susanne, Arcavi, Abraham, Karsenty, Ronnie","description":"Professional development (PD) courses are the main context for mathematics teachers' lifelong learning. Leaders with expertise are needed to facilitate these courses; thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the nature of this profession, its core practices, and the challenges it entails. This paper focuses on a specific group of facilitators: experienced mathematics teachers who have just begun facilitating PD courses in addition to their classroom teaching. To better understand these novice facilitators' practices, a commognitive approach was implemented to examine how they draw on their mathematics teaching experience when leading PD courses. In commognitive terms, these practitioners draw on multiple professional discourses, but mostly on the discourses of teaching and facilitation. The analysis of the challenges and affordances associated with participating in these two professional discourses showed that novice facilitators bring into play their teaching practices in four distinct ways: enacting a familiar practice, negating a familiar practice, questioning the relevance of a familiar practice, and generating a new practice based on their teaching experience. We claim that novice facilitators' well-established identity as teachers is both a challenge and an asset in grounding successful facilitation practices. Overall, facilitators modify their teaching experience through the adoption, adaptation, and retraction of their teaching practices. Implications for the preparation and support of facilitators, within processes of upscaling PD programs, are discussed.","subject":"Experienced Teachers, Mathematics Teachers, Novices, Facilitators (Individuals), Faculty Development, Mathematics Instruction, Teaching Experience, Educational Practices, Cognitive Processes, Discourse Analysis","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Embodied Mathematical Pedagogy to Liberate Racialized and Multilingual Bodies","author":"Liu, Shimeng, Takeuchi, Miwa Aoki","description":"When language is defined narrowly in mathematics classrooms, racially and linguistically minoritized students in classrooms could be systematically positioned as &quot;learners of deficiency.&quot; Recent scholarship calls for expanding the notion of language to emphasize embodied expression of mathematical ideas. Taking a critical perspective to understand racialized experiences of using languages in disciplinary learning spaces, this article proposes the reconceptualization of embodiment as a language for racialized multilingual learners. This study was conducted in a Grade 1 classroom in a linguistically and racially diverse school in Canada. Through a series of professional development sessions, we worked with an experienced teacher to redesign the normalized and institutionalized pedagogy toward greater mobility of racialized multilingual learners' bodies, which was intertwined with their intellectual liberation. Focusing on the spatiality of pedagogy, the previously restrictive areas in the school were transformed into a place that augments embodied expression of mathematical ideas and agentive participation of minoritized learners. The analysis focused on the embodied discourse that participating racialized multilingual students used to actively engage in mathematical discussion. Our findings show that the designed pedagogy, characterized by the spatial and temporal expansion of the learning environment, offered more spaces for uncertainty and spontaneity with the decreased control of the teacher as an explicator. Our article furthers anti-colonial approaches to understand the intersection of racialized bodies and language in mathematics education.","subject":"Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Multilingualism, Minority Group Students, Racism, Language Usage, Grade 1, Elementary School Students, Faculty Development, Discourse Analysis, Classroom Communication, Teacher Student Relationship, Foreign Countries","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Canada"},{"title":"The Effect of Implementation Intentions on Event-, Time-, and Activity-Based Prospective Memory in Typically Developing Children","author":"Yang, Tian-Xiao, Zhang, Shi-Yu, Wang, Ya, Su, Xiao-Min, Yuan, Chen-Wei, Lui, Simon S.

Implementation intention is a useful strategy for improving PM function in adults. Yet the effect of implementation intentions in children, and whether factors such as age, gender, and WM capacity could modulate its effect remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of implementation intentions on PM in 154 children at 7-11 years of age. The standard group received standard instructions on PM task, whereas the implementation intention group received additional PM instruction, which comprised the &quot;if . . . then . . .&quot; format and guided visual imagery of the PM scenario. Participants completed the computer-based PM tasks (tapping into focal event-, time-, and activity-based PM) and the WM tests. The results showed that the two groups exhibited similar focal event-, time-, and activity-based PM performance. Although age and gender did not modulate the effect of implementation intentions on PM, WM capacity moderated the implementation intention effect on time-based PM. Specifically, higher WM capacity predicted higher implementation intention benefit. These findings suggest that children with higher WM capacity may have higher chance to benefit from the implementation intention strategy.","subject":"Memory, Children, Intention, Age Differences, Gender Differences, Short Term Memory, Foreign Countries","source":"International Journal of Behavioral Development","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"title":"Gender Differences in High School Students&apos; Perceived Values and Costs of Learning Chemistry","author":"Gong, Xiaoyang, Bergey, Bradley W., Jin, Ying, Mao, Kexin, Cheng, Yan","description":"Students' perceived values and costs of learning chemistry influence their performance and intentions of choosing chemistry-related majors or careers.

Qualitative content analyses revealed that students' perceived values for chemistry could be categorized into five broad categories: utility value, epistemic value, intrinsic value, aesthetic value, and social value. Chi-square tests and multidimensional scaling revealed that boys and girls perceived values and costs in different ways: relational utility value was more salient to boys while practical utility value and epistemic value were more salient to girls; Girls perceived greater distinctions among different types of values (i.e., epistemic- and emotional-related values) and costs (i.e., emotional and ego cost) than boys. Independent t tests showed that boys reported mostly higher values and lower costs than girls. Hierarchical multiple regression found that gender, intrinsic value, social value and cost significantly predicted students' chemistry exam scores. In addition, the interaction between gender and social value was identified.

Assessing understanding of reaction mechanisms can be evaluated holistically, wherein the entire mechanism is considered; however, we assert that such an evaluation does not account for how learners variably understand mechanistic components (e.g., nucleophile, electrophile) or steps (e.g., nucleophilic attack, proton transfer). For example, a learner may have proficiency of proton transfer steps without sufficient proficiency of a step where a nucleophile and electrophile interact. Herein, we report the development of a generalized rubric to assess the level of explanation sophistication for nucleophiles in written explanations of organic chemistry reaction mechanisms from postsecondary courses. This rubric operationalizes and applies chemistry education research findings by articulating four hierarchical levels of explanation sophistication: absent, descriptive, foundational, and complex. We provide evidence for the utility of the rubric in an assortment of contexts: (a) stages of an organic chemistry course (i.e., first or second semester), (b) across nucleophile and reaction types, and (c) across prompt variations. We, as well, present a case study detailing how this rubric could be applied in a course to collect assessment data to inform learning and instruction. Our results demonstrate the practical implementation of this rubric to assess understanding of nucleophiles and offer avenues for establishing rubrics for additional mechanistic components, and understanding and evaluating curricula.","subject":"Scoring Rubrics, Organic Chemistry, Scientific Concepts, Student Evaluation, Evaluation Methods, Knowledge Level, College Science, College Students","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Florida"},{"title":"Adapting under Pressure: A Case Study in Scaling Faculty Development for Emergency Remote Teaching","author":"Gomez, David R., Swann, William, Willms Wohlwend, Mary, Spong, Stephanie","description":"This case study examines the adaptation of an existing online, asynchronous faculty development resource at the University of New Mexico to support the unanticipated need for all instructors to teach remotely starting in spring 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To enhance student engagement and academic achievement in language learning, personalized language learning (PLL) can be employed to consider individual learning needs. Personalized review learning has emerged to facilitate PLL as a promising means of enhancing the long-term preservation of skills and knowledge in language education. In this paper, a personalized review learning approach is proposed that improves behavioral engagement and academic achievement in language learning through e-books. It involves implementing an e-book system, namely BookRoll, which allows users to browse uploaded learning materials anytime and anywhere, in concert with a personalized review learning system based on repeated retrieval practice. To evaluate the effects of this approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted on two classes of sophomore undergraduate students majoring in accounting who were enrolled in a Japanese course. 47 students from one class were assigned to an experimental group, whereas 44 students from another class were assigned to a control group. The duration of the experiment was 8\u00a0weeks. The experimental group learned using both the e-book system and personalized review learning system, whereas the control group learned only using the e-book system. The experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in terms of both behavioral engagement and academic achievement. The findings indicate that the proposed approach enhanced the students' PLL experiences.","subject":"Individualized Instruction, Second Language Learning, Academic Achievement, Electronic Publishing, Books, Learner Engagement, Japanese, Undergraduate Students, Learning Management Systems","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Relationships between Teaching Presence, Connected Classroom Climate, and Deep Learning within the Rotational Synchronous Teaching Model","author":"Gong, Di, Yang, Harrison Hao, Wu, Di, Dai, Jinjun","description":"The rotational synchronous teaching (RST) model has attracted attention as it can increase the teaching presence and connected classroom climate in multiple synchronous classroom learning environments.

A Study to Design and Explore the Uses of Educational Music Games for Adults and Young Learners","author":"Wang, Yi-Hsuan","description":"The study aimed to examine the learning effects of integrating various game elements into game-based learning materials to enhance learning for learners of different age groups. Two sets of game-based music learning materials were designed. The version with full game characteristics was developed with a narrative story, diverse game behaviors, and game mechanisms, while the simple design version kept basic game behaviors only for game interaction, and removed other game-based elements. A total of 50 young students and 41 adults were invited to participate in the experiment and separately use the two versions of the game-based materials. In order to understand how their performance changed and their reflections on the use of the game-based learning materials, a pre- and post-test, questionnaire and interview were conducted, and the data were analyzed. Despite learners in various age groups having different preferences regarding the game design, the statistical analysis revealed that the simple version helped the learners of both age groups to achieve better learning performance than the full version. The game-based environments proved to be helpful for promoting students' learning motivation and performance, but the results suggest that instead of designing educational games with as many gamification elements as possible, game developers should take learners' cognitive learning load and information processing ability into consideration when developing games. The game elements could be refined through reducing overly complicated game mechanisms and keeping the basic game-like interaction so as to achieve both the instruction purpose and gameplay engagement.","subject":"Gamification, Game Based Learning, Music Education, Program Effectiveness, Age Differences, Educational Games, Design, Young Adults, Preadolescents, Educational Technology, Animation","source":"Journal of Educational Computing Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Commitment to the Profession of ELT and an Organization: A Profile of Expat Faculty in South Korea","author":"Moodie, Ian","description":"Despite its attention in the field of education, occupational commitment has received little attention in language teaching research. To address this gap, the study generates an occupational commitment profile of expatriate English language teachers and investigates how commitment relates to their age, sex, teaching experience, and qualifications. Eighty-two native English-speaking teachers at a private university in South Korea participated in the study by completing a survey measuring their affective, continuance, and normative commitment to the profession of English language teaching (ELT) and to their workplace. The descriptive results indicated that the sample had high affective commitment to the profession of ELT but low overall commitment to their organization. Results from MANCOVA, which controlled for the covariates of age and sex, indicated that respondents with teacher qualifications from their home countries tended to have higher levels of affective and normative commitment to the profession of ELT and to their workplace than respondents without teacher qualifications. However, no differences in commitment were found between respondents with ELT qualifications and respondents without ELT qualifications, nor were any differences found in commitment associated with ELT experience. Because affective-normative dominant profiles are associated with better workplace outcomes, such as effort given to an organization and lower turnover intentions, further consideration of this finding should be of high priority in language teacher commitment research.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Teacher Qualifications, Foreign Nationals, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Work Attitudes, Job Satisfaction, Profiles, Teaching Experience, Correlation, Age Differences, Gender Differences, Native Speakers, Higher Education, College Faculty","source":"Language Teaching Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"South Korea"},{"title":"Audio-Visual Input for Learning L2 Vocabulary and Grammatical Constructions","author":"Mu\u00f1oz, Carmen, Pujadas, Ge\u00f2rgia, Pattemore, Anastasiia","description":"This article addresses the benefits of audio-visual input for learning second language (L2) vocabulary and grammatical constructions.

Study 2 targets grammar acquisition in two groups of university students with an intermediate proficiency level who view 10 episodes over five weeks, one group with captions and one without captions. Results of both studies show significant correlations between language gains and frequency in the input, but the size of the frequency effect appears to depend on the type of support provided by the on-screen text. The analyses also show no significant advantage of captions or subtitles for vocabulary learning at this proficiency level, a significant advantage of captions over no captions for grammatical constructions learning, as well as the significant role of proficiency.

Work life balance today, especially in times of COVID where home and work place have transgressed boundaries is an imperative precursor for the well-being of an individual. A satisfying job well-integrated into life, balances the overall mental and emotional quotient of working women particularly in the current pandemic in which the workplace is posing a new and unlike set of challenges and problems for women. Research suggests that work place problems faced by the Indian women are mostly long working hours, less recognition of work, lack of motivation and stress related issues, but the new normal of working remotely from home now is altogether an unexpected work scenario. With respect to emerging nations, problems of work life balance among women in the education sector are not well researched. Increased women employment has led to a swelling attention from academia and industry on WLB. With greater access to better educational opportunities, increasing number of women are entering the workforce, and shifting from being home-makers to the organized work force, thereby necessitating an urgent need to examine this phenomenon. Carrying on with online classes remotely has become the order of the day, and it is becoming stressful when both school and personal life operate from the same space.

Both present contextualized prompts similar to previous studies, followed by response options with accompanying audio to control for intonation and pauses. Results suggest a number of key findings: (1) by the high intermediate level, L2ers acquire the relevant syntactic and syntax information structure interface competencies for both predicate types; (2) native speakers and L2 groups exhibit optionality, and only differ in nuanced ways; and (3) advanced learners show signs of acquiring syntactic and syntax-information structure competencies in numerous contexts, but display minor differences regarding optionality with corrective focus, an interface incorporating multiple interfaces (syntax-prosody pragmatics). Unlike the predictions of the Interface Hypothesis (IH), this subtle, non-native-like divergence is characterized by divergent knowledge of optionality similar to that found among native speakers. Attempting to understand more completely the development of native-speaker optionality, we also conduct a corpus study of child-directed Spanish from CHILDES and find that, although syntactic theory explains much of the data, it cannot account for all of the variability in the data.

However, to date, science education research has paid surprisingly little attention to the use of idealizations in fostering students' model competence and understanding of the nature of science (NOS). The starting point for the theoretical reflection in this paper is that insufficient consideration of idealizations in the science classroom can lead to learning difficulties. The following discussions should help to clarify the terms &quot;idealization&quot; and &quot;model&quot; and their relationship to each other. An example is drawn from physics. At least two cases can apply when considering model usage in the classroom. In the first case, to understand an observed phenomenon, a model (as a representation) of the situation to be explained is constructed. At this point, it is necessary to perform idealization. Seemingly, this step is still neglected in much of the science education literature but is well addressed in the philosophy of science. In the second case, existing models to work with are introduced, perhaps alongside a real experimental situation. This approach is called working with models in science education. This paper focuses primarily on the first case. Against the background of model building, a positioning and conceptual approximation of idealizations take place. To organize the idealization process, a framework of several categories of idealization adopted from science philosophy is offered. The framework is intended to stimulate explicit reflection about how models are constructed. The construction of a model by idealization is illustrated through an example from geometrical optics. Finally, the considerations presented are discussed in the context of the literature, and suggested research topics are provided.","subject":"Science Education, Scientific Concepts, Educational Research, Science Instruction, Teaching Methods, Models, Philosophy, Concept Formation, Epistemology","source":"Science & Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Teachers&apos; Perceptions of Brandon&apos;s Matrix as a Framework for the Teaching and Assessment of Scientific Methods in School Science","author":"Cullinane, Alison, Hillier, Judith, Childs, Ann, Erduran, Sibel","description":"This article utilizes a framework for classifying different scientific methods suggested by a philosopher of science (Brandon &quot;Synthese,&quot; 99, 59-73, 1994) called Brandon's Matrix. It presents findings from teachers who took part in a funded project in England that looked at the nature of scientific methods in science investigations. Science investigations are an integral aspect of science education and, as such, are often included in high stakes examinations. Therefore, teachers need to have a good understanding of a\u00a0range of scientific methods and their purposes in science investigations. The framework was used to ask teachers to classify science investigations based on how they teach them. It was also employed to devise assessments to measure students' understanding of scientific methods. The teachers were introduced to the new approaches and their perceptions were gathered to understand if they supported this as a framework for their classroom practice. Evidence from the study suggested that Brandon's Matrix appealed to teachers as a framework for practical science in schools, and they see potential benefits for its use in the teaching, learning, and assessment of science. Findings from the study showed it appealed to the teachers as a tool for classifying scientific methods, and how they also recognized the importance of assessing practical work and had an appreciation of the constraints and drivers in the current curriculum and assessment requirements\u00a0in England.

Bivariate and regression analysis pointed to complex relationships between the explanatory and outcome variables. On bivariate analysis, findings included statistically significant associations between gender, mathematics attainment, preparedness to teach, and one or both of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. In the regression analysis, gender was statistically significantly associated with outcome expectancy, while preparedness to teach and mathematics attainment were statistically significantly correlated with personal efficacy.

Our main aim was to investigate whether digital reading practices and reading engagement (reading motivation and metacognitive strategies) could act as protective factors, individually and collectively, promoting academic resilience among students with low SES. We conducted a multi-group structural equation model analysis with serial mediators to identify the characteristics of resilient students and their resilience pathways. We used a nationally representative sample of US adolescents from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 data. The results indicated that engaged readers--internally motivated and strategic--were resilient readers. Reading engagement was a source of resilience and helped them achieve high proficiency in reading as a consequence. Reading motivation and metacognitive strategies worked in tandem and sequentially to build resilient and strong readers and were also important mechanisms for linking digital reading practices to reading achievement. We thus highlight simultaneous motivational and strategic development in reading for low-SES students. It is particularly critical to increase students' overall level of reading motivation and to strengthen its pathways to metacognitive strategies and reading achievement. This process would be enhanced further by incorporating digital reading practices into instruction for engaged reading. Digital reading was related to reading motivation, and then to better awareness of metacognitive strategies, which in turn was shown to be linked to increased reading achievement for all students.","subject":"Resilience (Psychology), Literacy Education, Student Motivation, Cognitive Processes, Learner Engagement, Low Income Students, Reading Comprehension, Achievement Tests, Secondary School Students, Foreign Countries, International Assessment, Reading Habits, Electronic Books","source":"Reading Research Quarterly","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Development of Teachers&apos; Knowledge in a Lesson Study","author":"Da Ponte, Jo\u00e3o Pedro, Quaresma, Marisa, Mata-Pereira, Joana","description":"Purpose: This paper seeks to understand how teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) is developed during a lesson study regarded as a professional development process that places particular emphasis on teachers' knowledge of tasks, representations and students' learning.

Dairy Council of California launched the Let's Eat Healthy initiative to address nutrition security through collaborative solutions in the school environment. Implications For School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity: To ensure nutrition security for children and families, nutritious food and nutrition education must go hand-in-hand. Improving access to high quality food can help address the health disparities that exist for people who are at increased risk for food insecurity. Nutrition education supports students' holistic learning and social and emotional learning skills. Nutrition education models must be increasingly flexible in the face of ongoing challenges. Collaborative efforts to connect food access hubs, such as schools, with support and resources to provide evidence-based nutrition education and agricultural literacy can equip individuals and communities with the knowledge, skills, and ability to make nutrient-rich food choices. Conclusions: Investments and strategies in nutrition security that utilize the Individual plus Policy, System, and Environmental (I + PSE) model, such as the Let's Eat Healthy initiative, will effectively influence positive behavior change and improve community health.

During motor play, CWD often depend on teachers to provide direct instruction and frequent opportunities to practice motor skills, to interact with their peers, and learn new skills. To promote participation in physical activities for CWD, it is necessary to understand (a) teachers' perceptions about the importance of structured motor programs and (b) teachers' thoughts and concerns about implementing structured motor programs. The aim of this study was to understand teachers' perceptions about structured motor programs (e.g., obstacle course, bowling) and factors that may influence their motivation to implement them. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 teachers who taught in inclusive preschools. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed to identify key themes. The results show that the majority of participants valued structured motor programs and were aware of the benefits of implementing such programs with preschoolers. Several teachers expressed concerns about meeting the expectations of a motor program and preschoolers' challenging behaviors during such programs. Implications for practice from this study include the need to (a) provide professional development to help teachers support preschoolers with disabilities in learning motor skills and understanding how to arrange and scaffold opportunities for children to participate in physical activities and gross motor play with their typically developing peers, and (b) create quality structured motor programs to ensure that all children have access to motor learning opportunities in inclusive preschool settings.","subject":"Preschool Teachers, Inclusion, Motor Development, Psychomotor Skills, Physical Activity Level, Teacher Attitudes, Students with Disabilities, Program Implementation, Child Behavior, Class Activities","source":"Early Childhood Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Pre-Lab Video Demonstrations to Enhance Students&apos; Laboratory Experience in a First-Year Chemical Engineering Class","author":"Onyeaka, Helen, Passaretti, Paolo, Miri, Taghi, Hart, Abarasi, Favero, Claudia, Anumudu, Christian K., Robbins, Phillip","description":"The limited capabilities of teaching laboratories, combined with an increasing number of students enrolled in university, require constant augmentation of instructional approaches. By enhancing laboratory demonstrations with digital technology, these structural issues can be addressed while at the same time enhancing student understanding and learning. Our case study focuses on the fermentation lab part of the Reaction Equilibria and Thermodynamics (RET) module, a first-year chemical engineering course at the University of Birmingham. Video demonstrations were used to introduce students to the laboratory set-ups and walk them through each step and technique. The video demonstrations allowed the students to attend the in-person lab sessions having established knowledge and understanding of the processes involved and the outcomes desired, which decreased the burden on the facilities and the staff. A knowledge-based quiz and a student survey conducted at the end of the module showed that the pre-lab videos encouraged more active participation in the laboratory sessions and reinforced learning. Approximately 70% of the students polled in the first survey conducted within this project felt more confident going into the laboratory sessions after watching the pre-lab videos and attempting the knowledge quiz, while 92% of the students polled in the second survey judged the pre-lab video sessions as beneficial to them. Overall, the teaching method has the potential to improve student participation and access, boost confidence and learning, and provided a more structured and flexible approach to laboratory learning outcomes.","subject":"Science Laboratories, Science Instruction, Thermodynamics, Chemical Engineering, Video Technology, Instructional Effectiveness, Student Attitudes, Knowledge Level, Student Participation, Technology Uses in Education, Foreign Countries, College Students, College Science","source":"Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom (Birmingham)"},{"title":"The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Tipping Point: The Precarity of Transition for Students Who Receive Special Education and English Language Services","author":"Trainor, Audrey, Romano, Lindsay, Sarkissian, Gracy, Newman, Lynn","description":"Background: School closures and service disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted students' postschool transitions. Students with disabilities who were also members of historically marginalized groups including immigrant students, multilingual students, students of color, and those experiencing poverty, were disproportionately negatively impacted by pandemic-limited services. Objective: This paper examined the impact of the pandemic on the transition experiences of secondary students receiving both special education and English learner services. Method: We collected and analyzed data from ethnographic interviews with 26 students, their parents, and teachers. A close analysis of a representative case illustrates how transition education and planning were affected by challenges introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic for some of the nation's most vulnerable students. Results: Despite postsecondary education goals and high parent expectations, evidence of minimal information sharing between school and family, specific plans for goal actualization, and interruptions to service delivery negatively impacted goal attainment, tipping precariously positioned transition plans toward missed opportunities. Conclusion: The pandemic accentuated pre-existing inequities in transition and vocational rehabilitation (VR) services. Implications for practice and research are discussed, including the importance of supported family engagement, enhanced self-determination skills, and integrated VR services into high school special education programming.

Failing to provide the opportunity to learn to read has devastating effects on children and alarmingly, the current reality fails some students disproportionately--the number of students reading proficiently drops precipitously for Black students, Hispanic students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Critical to righting this inequity are well-prepared teachers who can deliver engaging opportunities for students to learn core content foundational for reading comprehension. However, for teachers to provide students with background knowledge to support them in becoming successful readers, they must first gain the knowledge themselves. Teacher preparation programs, therefore, play a critical role in providing aspiring teachers with the content knowledge they need to teach their future students. Are preparation programs achieving this goal? To find out, the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) engaged experts from the field, teacher preparation program faculty, and measurement experts to design the Building Content Knowledge standard, one of the seven standards of the Teacher Prep Review, to ascertain the extent to which undergraduate elementary teacher preparation programs (and the institutions in which they are housed) build candidates' content knowledge in two core subject areas: science and social studies.

The quality of a public academic speaker's oral presentation may highly be determined by a variety of emotive elements. However, this has received much too little attention in the realm of academic dissertation oral defense presentations, despite the fact that this process may be incredibly nerve-wracking for both novice and experienced postgraduates, EFL learners in particular. In the current study, 68 Chinese EFL Ph.D. candidates consented to complete a revamped version of the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA). Chinese EFL postgraduates reported an average high level of public speaking anxiety (X=4.34) during their doctoral dissertation defense presentations, as measured by three categorical variables: public speaking apprehension (X=4.40), self-behavior management (X=4.35), and fear of negative evaluation (X=4.26). Throughout Ph.D. candidate participants' dissertation defense, fifteen anxiety-related questionnaire items were recognized to be the most anxiety-provoking conditions in terms of public speaking anxiety. In addition, differences in gender and graduate study specialization were not significantly associated with Chinese EFL Ph.D. candidates' experiences with public speaking anxiety. Despite the findings, research has revealed that Ph.D. candidates in English as a Foreign Language from China exhibit statistically significant levels of anxiety related to public speaking, and as a result, pedagogical recommendations have been proposed.","subject":"Anxiety, Doctoral Dissertations, Doctoral Students, Student Attitudes, English for Academic Purposes, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Public Speaking, Oral Language, Asians, Measures (Individuals), Metacognition, Fear, Student Evaluation, Item Analysis, Teaching Methods, English (Second Language), Foreign Students, Holistic Approach, Foreign Countries","source":"Online Submission","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"title":"Culturally Responsive Reading: Teaching Literature for Social Justice","author":"Washington, Durthy A.","description":"Help students to explore the intertextuality of literature and to think more deeply and compassionately about the world. This book shows high school teachers and college instructors how to foreground a work's cultural context, recognizing that every culture has its own narrative tradition of oral and written classics that inform its literature. The author introduces readers to the LIST Paradigm, a guided approach to culturally responsive reading that encourages readers to access and analyze a text by asking significant questions designed to foster close, critical reading. By combining aspects of both literary analysis (exploring the elements of fiction such as plot, setting, and character) and literary criticism (exploring works from multiple perspectives such as historical, psychological, and archetypal), the LIST Paradigm helps educators &quot;unlock&quot; literature with four keys to culture: Language, Identity, Space, and Time. In &quot;Culturally Responsive Reading,&quot; Washington exposes cultural myths, reveals racist and culturally biased language, dismantles stereotypes, and prevents the egregious misreading of works written by people of color. Book Features: (1) Describes a unique approach to culturally responsive reading, including specific teaching strategies and rich classroom examples; (2) Explores numerous texts by writers of color that are rarely included as required reading in literature courses; (3) Provides examples and illustrations of innovative ways to incorporate multicultural texts into an introductory literature course; (4) Incorporates epigraphs and questions that highlight each component of the LIST approach; and (5) Includes a critical essay that guides teachers through the process of teaching a complex postmodern novel (Junot D\u00edaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao).

Literacy and adoption scholars have studied the replacement of the heritage language with a second language and reported it as a permanent loss. Returning to the country of origin, return adoptees challenge such notion by relearning the heritage language as part of their homecoming. We explore how this heritage language relearning could be seen as a renegotiation of the language hierarchies between the adoptive community and the community of origin of languages in the relationship between the adoptive region and the region of origin. Building on Gayatri Chakrabarty Spivak's &quot;Enabling Violation&quot; concept, we deploy a postcolonial perspective on understanding heritage language relearning in transnational adoptees. We discuss how language relearning can challenge and reproduce the asymmetrical relation between adoptees' position in the Global North and their first families in the Global South. We argue that heritage language relearning can open the door for adoptees to engage with transnational literacy, carving out global learning trajectories and reconnecting their adoptive and first world. The last section of this article discusses adoption organisations' dialectic response to this shift by partaking in the organisation of heritage language classes for adoptees. We argue that adult education centres and literacy educators can play a pivotal role in further institutionalising these heritage language classes for transnational adoptees.","subject":"Adult Literacy, Adoption, Heritage Education, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Literacy Education, Native Language, Language Skill Attrition","source":"Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Impacts of the COVID-19 Disruption on the Language and Literacy Development of Monolingual and Heritage Bilingual Children in the United States","author":"Sun, Xin, Marks, Rebecca A., Eggleston, Rachel L., Zhang, Kehui, Lau, Chikyi, Yu, Chi-Lin, Nickerson, Nia, Kovelman, Ioulia","description":"Children who speak one language at home and a different language at school may be at higher risk of falling behind in their academic achievement when schooling is disrupted.

All children attended English-only schools that implemented varied forms of virtual and hybrid schooling during the pandemic. Pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19 examinations were conducted with 237 children (M(SD)[subscript age] = 7.78 (1.54) at Time 1) from relatively high SES homes, including 95 monolinguals, 75 Spanish-English and 67 Chinese-English bilinguals.

Specifically, between Time 1 and Time 2, monolingual children made age-appropriate improvements in all literacy measurements. Relative to monolinguals, both bilingual groups showed greater gains in vocabulary but lower gains in reading comprehension. Moreover, across groups, children's independent reading practices during COVID-19 were positively associated with children's literacy growth during the pandemic-related schooling disruptions.

Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence, MT now most widely assumes a new form, the so-called Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which offers the potential for a wide application in foreign language learning (FLL). Therefore, the purpose of this review study is to explore different approaches to the efficient implementation of NMT into FLL and provide specific pedagogical implications for best practices. The PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was strictly followed. The search was conducted in two well-established databases, specifically Scopus and Web of Science, to generate sufficient data from research articles for further analysis. The findings of this systematic review indicate that NMT is an efficient tool for developing both productive (speaking and writing) and receptive (reading and listening) language skills, including mediation skills, which are relevant for translation. Moreover, the results show that NMT tools are especially suitable for advanced learners of L2, whose higher proficiency level enables them to critically reflect on the output of NMT texts more than beginners or lower-intermediate learners. Thus, the findings of this review study reveal that NMT has valuable implications for L2 pedagogy since it can serve as a very powerful online reference tool for FLL provided that teachers introduce students to its benefits but also limitations by implementing various teaching approaches.","subject":"Translation, Computational Linguistics, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Best Practices, Meta Analysis, Research Reports, Databases, Language Skills, Skill Development, Teaching Methods, Receptive Language, Expressive Language, Language Proficiency, Artificial Intelligence","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"A Meta-Analysis of the Worked Examples Effect on Mathematics Performance","author":"Barbieri, Christina Areizaga, Miller-Cotto, Dana, Clerjuste, Sarah N., Chawla, Kamal","description":"The current meta-analysis quantifies the average effect of worked examples on mathematics performance from elementary grades to postsecondary settings and to assess what moderates this effect.

Exclusionary coding was conducted on 8033 abstracts from published and grey literature to yield a sample of high quality experimental and quasi-experimental work. This search yielded 43 articles reporting on 55 studies and 181 effect sizes. Using robust variance estimation (RVE) to account for clustered effect sizes, the average effect size of worked examples on mathematics performance outcomes was medium with g = 0.48 and p = 0.01. Moderators assessed included example type (correct vs. incorrect examples alone or in combination with correct examples), pairing with self-explanation prompts, and timing of administration (i.e., practice vs. skill acquisition). The inclusion of self-explanation prompts significantly moderated the effect of examples yielding a negative effect in comparison to worked examples conditions that did not include self-explanation prompts. Worked examples studies that used correct examples alone yielded larger effect sizes than those that used incorrect examples alone or correct examples in combination with incorrect examples. The worked examples effect yields a medium effect on mathematics outcomes whether used for practice or initial skill acquisition. Correct examples are particularly beneficial for learning overall, and pairing examples with self-explanation prompts may not be a fruitful design modification.

The purpose is to enhance the acquisition and learning of information technology and English application among schoolchildren in the remote area. Participants were evaluated in accordance with their learning motivation, self-efficacy, and learning effect. The self-efficacy scale was designed from three dimensions of the self-efficacy theory presented by Bandura and the syllabus of five functions in Scratch. The teaching effects were investigated with paired sample t test. The results of these assessments revealed that schoolchildren's learning motivation has been elevated, with a significant improvement of self-efficacy and overall learning achievement. In addition, the post-test revealed that Scratch programming and English learning from the culture-based illustration book had significant correlation, which suggested that the overall program successfully integrated these two subjects.","subject":"Programming, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Interdisciplinary Approach, College Students, Rural Schools, Picture Books, Electronic Books, Learning Motivation, Self Efficacy, Program Effectiveness, Foreign Countries, Elementary School Students","source":"IEEE Transactions on Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"title":"Accommodating Heterogeneity: The Interaction of Instructional Scaffolding with Student Preconditions in the Learning of Hypothesis-Based Reasoning","author":"Grimm, Hanna, Edelsbrunner, Peter A., M\u00f6ller, Kornelia","description":"Hypothesis-based reasoning with conditionals is a skill that is required for engaging in integral activities of modern elementary school science-curricula.

We examine whether a scaffold that is static yet tailored to the context, in which the teacher explicitly models the reasoning process, manages to meet students' individual cognitive preconditions for learning this skill. Within an inquiry-based learning setting, N = 143 third-graders underwent either an experimental condition in which they received the explicit scaffold, or a control condition in which they did not receive this specific scaffold. Employing a latent transition analysis and a general additive model, it is examined how the additional scaffold interacted with students' prior knowledge, inhibition ability, and logical reasoning judged by their own teachers. It is found that the additional scaffolds managed to meet the needs of students with little prior knowledge; under the control condition, students with little prior knowledge showed decreased learning achievement, whereas under the experimental condition, students with differing prior knowledge learned to comparable extent and on a higher level. The scaffolds also almost fully diminished a disadvantage for students with lower teacher-judged logical reasoning, and supported students with high inhibition ability in mastering the most difficult aspect of reasoning based on irrelevant evidence.

We used the Apt-AIR framework, which expounds on the components needed for successful epistemic education, as a tool to identify students' apt epistemic processes. The results illustrate that elementary students were able to activate cognitive, emotional, and--to a lesser extent--metacognitive and collaborative epistemic processes related to data literacy skills in this context. Additionally, the design features embedded in the experimentation lesson were more successful in engaging students in apt epistemic processes; yet the data analysis lesson, while engaging students in fewer processes overall, was successful in promoting students' ability to make accurate inferences using an aggregate view of data.

How can we improve learners' flexible application of knowledge to distant domains? In a counterintuitive phenomenon termed the &quot;derring effect,&quot; deliberately committing and correcting errors in low-stakes contexts enhances learning more than avoiding errors. Whereas this benefit has been demonstrated with tests in domains similar to those in the initial learning task, the present set of three experiments (N = 120) investigated whether deliberate erring boosts far transfer of conceptual knowledge to dissimilar domains. Undergraduates studied scientific expository texts either by generating conceptually correct responses or by deliberately generating conceptually erroneous responses then correcting them. Deliberate erring improved not only retention (Experiment 1), but also far transfer on inferential test questions that required applying the learned concepts to remote knowledge domains (e.g., from biology\/vaccines to geography\/forest management techniques; Experiment 2). This advantage held even over a control that further involved spotting and correcting the same errors that one's peers had deliberately made (Experiment 3). Yet, learners failed to predict or recognize the benefits of deliberate erring even after the test. Altogether, these results suggest that the derring effect is specific to generating incorrect, but not correct, elaborations. Neither does mere exposure to others' errors nor juxtaposing these errors with the correct responses suffice. Rather, guiding learners to personally commit and correct deliberate errors is vital for enhancing generalization and far transfer of learning to distant knowledge domains.","subject":"Transfer of Training, Error Correction, Learning Processes, Undergraduate Students, Science Instruction, Scientific Concepts, Retention (Psychology), Science Tests, Educational Benefits, Error Patterns, Peer Evaluation, Generalization, Comparative Analysis","source":"Educational Psychology Review","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Examination of the Views of Science Teachers Trained in a Project on Socioscientific Issues","author":"Tekin, Nurcan, Aslan, Oktay, Keles, \u00d6zg\u00fcl","description":"Socioscientific issues (SSIs) have a scientific basis, have a dilemma in their nature and are often discussed under political and social influences.

This work explores the use of the 20-item Math-Up Skills Test (MUST) in a first-semester organic chemistry course over two years at a small private university. Analysis of scores on the MUST, which is taken during the first week of the semester, indicates a statistically significant difference between successful and unsuccessful first-time students (n = 74 and 49, respectively) as the MUST has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.861) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.29). Taken alone, the MUST predicts students at risk of not passing the course with 64% accuracy; addition of start-of-term science GPA data improves predictions to 82% accuracy. Predictions are further improved with incorporation of scores from the first exam of the semester.

The Mental Rotations Test (MRT) has been routinely used to assess visuospatial ability. This study aimed to introduce students to drawing as a learning strategy for anatomy. Undergraduate speech science anatomy students took part in a drawing tutorial (n\u00a0=\u00a092), completed an MRT test, pre- and post-tutorial tests, and surveys regarding their use and attitudes toward drawing as a study tool. The impact on their examination performance was then assessed. Regardless of MRT score or attitude to drawing, students who participated in the drawing tutorial demonstrated immediate improvement in post-tutorial test scores. Students in the drawing group performed better in most anatomy components of the examination, but the result did not reach statistical significance. There was only a positive correlation between MRT score and one type of anatomy question (non-image-based) and speech physics questions (r\u00a0=\u00a00.315, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). The unexpected finding may relate to the MRT which assesses spatial rather than object visualization skills. Students who liked drawing also performed significantly better in word-based and speech physics questions. It is likely that the style of identification question did not require the mental manipulation ability assessed in the MRT. This study demonstrated that students with lower MRT scores are not outperformed in all aspects of anatomy assessment.

A mixed-methods survey was sent to the directors of entry-level occupational therapy programs in the United States. Survey responses were compiled to best represent the current occupational therapy education environment. Ten of sixty-eight participating programs did not teach anatomy as a part of their standard occupational therapy curriculum. Of the programs that featured entry-level occupational therapy anatomy courses, the majority were taught by either a non-clinician anatomist or an OT without specialized anatomy training in a region-based, standalone anatomy course during the first semester. In most programs, anatomy was taught to only occupational therapy students using lecture, models\/plastination, and\/or prosection. Teaching tools, methods, faculty, and programmatic factors were perceived as contributing to program strengths. The design, resources, and faculty involved in the occupational therapy anatomy course may negatively impact the perceived quality of an occupational therapy anatomy program and its students.

The findings showed that mastery of the\u00a0epistemic actions contributed to the improvement of mathematics achievement individually as well as collectively. The actions of &quot;selecting&quot; and &quot;computing&quot; contributed to higher mathematics achievement across grades 6 to 8, while the development of &quot;representing&quot; improved mathematics achievement, though to a lesser degree. Students with all four epistemic actions had considerably higher mathematics achievement compared to their peers with other possible combinations of &quot;selecting,&quot; &quot;analyzing,&quot; &quot;computing,&quot; and &quot;representing.&quot; We also found learning loss because of the transition from elementary school to middle school. The findings suggested that students need to be offered more opportunities to experience these epistemic actions collectively with greater instructional emphasis on analyzing patterns and selecting strategies to find correct answers. However, when students have difficulties in the development of epistemic actions, teachers can have different emphasis on &quot;representing&quot; in elementary schools, &quot;selecting&quot; and &quot;analyzing&quot; in middle schools, and &quot;computing&quot; through elementary and middle schools.","subject":"Mathematics Achievement, Epistemology, Teaching Methods, Mathematics Instruction, Middle School Students, Problem Solving","source":"International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Preliminary Evidence of Key Factors in Successful Flipping: Predicting Positive Student Experiences in Flipped Classrooms","author":"Sointu, Erkko, Hyypi\u00e4, Mareena, Lambert, Matthew C., Hirsto, Laura, Saarelainen, Markku, Valtonen, Teemu","description":"Flipped classrooms have become widely adopted in educational settings (e.g., in higher education) worldwide. However, there is a need for more precise understanding of the ingredients for student satisfaction in a flipped setting. The aim of this paper was to investigate university students' experiences of the factors that create a successful flipped course. Ten measures were used to investigate the hypothesized factors affecting satisfaction, which were chosen based on the results from previous flipped classroom studies and higher educational research. These measures were grouped into three dimensions: (1) pedagogical (five measures), (2) social (three measures), and (3) technological (two measures). Exploratory factor analysis was run to analyze the adequacy of the instruments. Results revealed that the factor structure was as expected and that the instruments measuring all ten factors of teaching and learning in a flipped classroom were adequate. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis was used to formally operationalize the hypothesized latent constructs, and to build a structural equation model for predicting the student satisfaction of a flipped classroom. In the end, seven factors were found to predict student satisfaction with flipped courses. The highest predictor was guidance from the dimension of pedagogy, and the second-best predictor was experienced teaching for understanding. The results, limitations, and conclusion are discussed in terms of key issues and the development of a flipped classroom pedagogical design for higher education.","subject":"Flipped Classroom, Educational Technology, Student Satisfaction, College Students, Instruction, Interpersonal Relationship, Technology Uses in Education, Test Validity, Factor Structure, Predictor Variables","source":"Higher Education: The International Journal of Higher Education Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Predicting Students&apos; Performance in English and Mathematics Using Data Mining Techniques","author":"Roslan, Muhammad Haziq Bin, Chen, Chwen Jen","description":"This study attempts to predict secondary school students' performance in English and Mathematics subjects using data mining (DM) techniques. It aims to provide insights into predictors of students' performance in English and Mathematics, characteristics of students with different levels of performance, the most effective DM technique for students' performance prediction, and the relationship between these two subjects. The study employed the archival data of students who were 16\u00a0years old in 2019 and sat for the Malaysian Certificate of Examination (MCE) in 2021. The learning of English and Mathematics is a concern in many countries. Three main factors, namely students' past academic performance, demographics, and psychological attributes were scrutinized to identify their impact on the prediction. This study utilized the Orange software for the DM process. It employed Decision Tree (DT) rules to determine the characteristics of students with low, moderate, and high performance in English and Mathematics subjects. DT and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) techniques show the best predictive performance for English and Mathematics subjects, respectively. Such characteristics and predictions may cue appropriate interventions to improve students' performance in these subjects. This study revealed students' past academic performance as the most critical predictor, as well as a few demographics and psychological attributes. By examining top predictors derived using four different classifier types, this study found that students' past Mathematics performance predicts their MCE English performance and students' past English performance predicts their MCE Mathematics performance. This finding shows students' performances in both subjects are interrelated.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Secondary School Students, Academic Achievement, English Instruction, Mathematics Achievement, Data Use, Information Retrieval, Pattern Recognition, Data Analysis, Information Technology, Prior Learning, Psychological Patterns, Predictor Variables, Student Characteristics","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Malaysia"},{"title":"The Interplay between the Guidance from the Digital Learning Environment and the Teacher in Supporting Folding Back","author":"H\u00e4hki\u00f6niemi, Markus, Francisco, John, Lehtinen, Antti, Nieminen, Pasi, Pehkonen, Salla","description":"Previous studies have proposed that students' mathematical understanding develops dynamically through the process known as folding back, in which learners revisit earlier forms of understanding and use them to build even deeper levels of mathematical understanding. Digital learning environments, where students can manipulate representations, are often used to enable students to notice properties, patterns, or rules. When working in such an environment, students usually receive support from the environment and the teacher. The interplay between these different sources of support is important according to previous studies. In this study, we examine this interplay in the case of folding back. The study aims to understand how the teacher, together with the learning environment, can support the process of folding back. We collected data from second, fourth, and sixth grade students as they worked in groups to develop a rule for balancing a balance beam in a digital learning environment designed to support folding back. One pre-service teacher guided each three-student group. Data were analyzed by identifying occasions for folding back and characterizing different ways in which the interplay between the teacher and the environment supported students' folding back. We found different kinds of synergy between the two sources of support. The teachers followed up on and augmented the support from the environment, initiated supplementary folding back, and reinforced the support from the environment. We also found non-synergy between the two sources of support, when the teachers' support was not aligned with support from the environment.","subject":"Electronic Learning, Educational Environment, Mathematics Skills, Prior Learning, Mathematics Instruction, Teaching Methods, Elementary School Students, Mathematics Teachers, Interaction, Teacher Student Relationship, Alignment (Education)","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Examining the Effect of Digital Storytelling on English Speaking Proficiency, Willingness to Communicate, and Group Cohesion","author":"Huang, Heng-Tsung Danny","description":"This study focused on digital storytelling (DST) as a task in technology-mediated task-based language teaching and examined its effects on English speaking proficiency, willingness to communicate in English (WTCE), and group cohesion (GC).

While higher education institutions are increasingly considering replacing classroom time and offering more blended learning, current research is limited regarding its effectiveness and modifying design factors. This study analysed a flexible study programme with 133 courses in a blended learning design in different disciplines over more than 4\u00a0years with a mixed-methods approach. In the analysed flexible study programme, classroom instruction time was reduced by 51% and replaced with an online learning environment in a blended learning format (N students = 278). Student achievement was compared to the conventional study format (N students = 1068). The estimated summary effect size for the 133 blended learning courses analysed was close to, but not significantly different from, zero (d = -\u00a00.0562, p = 0.3684). Although overall effectiveness was equivalent to the conventional study format, considerable variance in the effect sizes between the courses was observed. Based on the relative effect sizes of the courses and data from detailed analyses and surveys, heterogeneity can be explained by differences in the implementation quality of the educational design factors. Our results indicate that when implementing flexible study programmes in a blended learning design, particular attention should be paid to the following educational design principles: adequate course structure and guidance for students, activating learning tasks, stimulating interaction and social presence of teachers, and timely feedback on learning process and outcomes.","subject":"Blended Learning, Instructional Effectiveness, Instructional Design, Higher Education, Academic Achievement, Effect Size, Educational Quality, Program Design","source":"International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"A Path Model of Contextual Factors Influencing Science Teachers&apos; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge","author":"Kulaksiz, Taibe, Karaca, Feride","description":"A three-phase exploratory sequential mixed-method study was conducted to propose and test a model showing the interrelationships among the contextual factors influencing the science teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Though developing teachers' TPACK is critical for technology integration in education, the contextual factors influencing TPACK were mostly neglected and this study aimed to fill this gap in the literature. The first phase of the study was aimed to determine the contextual factors by interviewing science teachers and educational technology experts. The findings revealed nine common factors involving student influence, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, technological infrastructure, administrative support, technical support, colleague interaction, lack of time, professional development, educational technology experience. In the second phase, a path model was hypothesized based on qualitative study results and related literature. In the third phase, a valid and reliable scale, named Contextual Factors Scale was developed to measure these contextual factors. Then, a questionnaire involving this scale and TPACK was administrated to 348 science teachers. Showing complex interrelationships among contextual factors, the model explained 45% of the variance in science teachers' TPACK, with particular importance placed on professional development, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, administrative support, and student influence. Looking from a holistic perspective, this study provided a valuable model for guiding decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners about how to improve teachers' TPACK and technology integration in the schools. Considering the complex interrelationships in the model, some simultaneous strategies dealing with each factor should be applied to improve teachers' TPACK and technology-related practices in the schools.","subject":"Science Teachers, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Science Instruction, Context Effect, Teacher Attitudes, Technical Support, Time Management, Faculty Development, Measures (Individuals), Technological Literacy, Technology Integration, Correlation, Peer Relationship","source":"Education and Information Technologies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Investment and Motivation in Language Learning: What&apos;s the Difference?","author":"Darvin, Ron, Norton, Bonny","description":"The year 2020 marked the 25th year since Bonny Norton published her influential &quot;TESOL Quarterly&quot; article, 'Social identity, investment, and language learning' (Norton Peirce, 1995) and the fifth year since we, Darvin and Norton (2015), co-authored 'Identity and a model of investment in applied linguistics' in the &quot;Annual Review of Applied Linguistics.&quot; From the time Norton's 1995 piece was published, investment and motivation have been conceptually imbricated and often collocated, as they hold up two different lenses to investigate the same reality: why learners choose to learn an additional language (L2). In our 2015 article, we made the case that while it is important to ask the question, 'Are students motivated to learn a language?' it is equally productive to ask, 'Are students invested in the language practices of the classroom or community?' (Darvin &amp; Norton, 2015, p. 37). We recognize that the relationship between language teachers and learners is unequal, and that teachers hold the power to shape these practices in diverse ways. Teachers bring to the classroom not only their personal histories and knowledge, but also their own worldviews and assumptions (Darvin, 2015), which may or may not align with those of learners. Relations of power between learners can also be unequal. As Norton and Toohey (2011, p. 421) note: A language learner may be highly motivated, but may nevertheless have little investment in the language practices of a given classroom or community, which may, for example, be racist, sexist, elitist, anti-immigrant, or homophobic. Alternatively, the language learner's conception of good language teaching may not be consistent with that of the teacher, compromising the learner's investment in the language practices of the classroom. Thus, the language learner, despite being highly motivated, may not be invested in the language practices of a given classroom.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Language Teachers, Teacher Student Relationship, Power Structure, Second Language Instruction, Classroom Environment","source":"Language Teaching","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Dyad Pedagogy in Practical Anatomy: A Description of the Implementation and Student Perceptions of an Adaptive Approach to Cadaveric Teaching","author":"Cullinane, Dearbhla P., Barry, Denis S.","description":"Prior to the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, anatomy practical sessions at Trinity College Dublin involved eight to 10 students per donor station, rotating between digital learning, anatomical models\/osteology, and dissection activities for three hours weekly. To maintain cadaveric participation in the anatomy laboratory while adhering to distancing guidelines, a transition to dyad pedagogy was implemented. This mode of delivery allowed two students per donor station to spend one hour per week in the anatomy laboratory with all digital learning elements transferred to the virtual learning platform Blackboard as pre- and post-practical session learning activities. Dyad pedagogy has been explored in clinical settings and simulation procedural-based training but is yet to be fully verified in anatomy education. To determine the effectiveness of hybrid practical sessions and reduced donor to student ratios, the opinions of first year medical students were examined using an online questionnaire with a 51% response rate. Although students recognized the merits of more time in the anatomy laboratory, including opportunities for self-directed study and exposure to anatomical variation, they felt that having two students per station enabled sufficient hands-on time with the donor body and fostered learning opportunities that would not be possible with larger groups. Strong preferences for quality time with the donor body supported by online resources suggests this modality should be a key consideration in course design for anatomy curricula and emphasizes the importance of gauging students' preferences to optimize satisfaction and learning output when pivoting to blended learning strategies in anatomy education.","subject":"Anatomy, Laboratory Procedures, Human Body, College Students, Foreign Countries, Science Laboratories, Laboratory Training, Electronic Learning, Science Instruction, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Blended Learning, Medical Students, Independent Study, Hands on Science, Student Attitudes, Undergraduate Students, Medical Education","source":"Anatomical Sciences Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Ireland"},{"title":"The Use of Lectures: Effective Pedagogy or Seeds Scattered on the Wind?","author":"Loughlin, Colin, Lindberg-Sand, \u00c5sa","description":"This case study of large-class teaching at a UK university focuses on the place of large-scale lectures in academics' approaches to teaching, their &quot;use&quot; by students in their studies, and their relationship to institutional quality assurance policies.

While the COVID-19 pandemic generated collective uncertainty, healthcare-related uncertainty is omnipresent. Correspondingly, there is increasing focus on uncertainty tolerance as a health professional graduate &quot;competency,&quot; and a concomitant interest in identifying pedagogy fostering learners' uncertainty tolerance. Despite these calls, practical guidelines for educators are lacking. There is some initial evidence that anatomy education can foster medical students' uncertainty tolerance (e.g., anatomical variation and dissection novelty), however, there remains a knowledge gap regarding robust curriculum-wide uncertainty tolerance teaching strategies. Drawing upon humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) educators' established uncertainty tolerance pedagogies, this study sought to learn from HASS academics' experiences with, and teaching practices related to, uncertainty pedagogy using a qualitative, exploratory study design. Framework analysis was undertaken using an abductive approach, wherein researchers oscillate between inductive and deductive coding (comparing to the uncertainty tolerance conceptual model). During this analysis, the authors analyzed [approximately]386\u00a0min of data from purposively sampled HASS academics' (n\u00a0=\u00a014) discussions to address the following research questions: (1) What teaching practices do HASS academics' perceive as impacting learners' uncertainty tolerance, and (2) How do HASS academics execute these teaching practices? The results extend current understanding of the moderating effects of education on uncertainty tolerance and supports prior findings that the anatomy learning environment is ripe for supporting learner uncertainty tolerance development. This study adds to growing literature on the powerful moderating effect education has on uncertainty tolerance and proposes translation of HASS uncertainty tolerance teaching practices to enhance anatomy education.","subject":"Ambiguity (Context), Anatomy, Science Education, Student Attitudes, Emotional Response, Stimuli, Medical Students, Teaching Methods, Science Instruction, Humanities, Art Education, Social Sciences","source":"Anatomical Sciences Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Characterizing Teachers&apos; Collective Learning through Lesson Study As\u00a0Document Development: A\u00a0Case\u00a0Study in China","author":"Huang, Xingfeng, Huang, Rongjin","description":"Purpose: This study aimed to explore how an adapted theoretical framework by networking two theories could help document teachers' collective learning through lesson study. Design\/methodology\/approach: Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growth (IMPG) and Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD) has been used individually to document teachers' professional learning from different aspects. The IMPG captures teachers' growth through the iterative process and dynamics (i.e. enactment and reflection) among four domains (personal domain, external domain, practice domain and consequence domain). At the same time, the DAD primarily focuses on teacher learning through the interactions between resources and teachers. To deepen understanding of teachers' learning through lesson study, in this study, a networked theoretical framework through which the DAD model is enriched by incorporating some ideas from IMPG is proposed. A lesson study, including five stages of study, plan, enact, reflect and refine, facilitated by a researcher was conducted in Shanghai China. The data sets including all videotaped meetings and research lessons and lesson plans of the lesson study are analyzed based on the adapted framework qualitatively. Findings: The results show that the teachers' document evolved from adopting the traditional teaching materials to adapting both traditional ones and e-resources with careful consideration of student learning through the lesson study process.

This particularly affects written language skills, which require advanced language knowledge. The reasons are manifold, but one is prominent, namely poor vocabulary knowledge. Vocabulary, however, consists not only of the number of known words but also of a complex and hitherto under-researched lexico-semantic framework, which is referred to as vocabulary depth. Method: In the present study, a sample of 373 children (322 German native speakers and 51 with German as a second language) was examined longitudinally in Grade 2 and 3 for their reading comprehension and vocabulary breadth and depth. Vocabulary depth was defined as relational and semantic word knowledge. Latent change score models on vocabulary breadth and depth development including reading precursor skills, non-verbal intelligence and SES were conducted. Results: The children with German as a second language scored lower than the native German speakers in reading and vocabulary tests, with the difference in vocabulary depth being more pronounced than in vocabulary breadth. Importantly, the differences did not tend to diminish over time, which could have been expected. The differences in reading comprehension can be accounted for mainly by the variations in vocabulary, especially in vocabulary depth. Conclusions: These findings emphasise the importance of including not only vocabulary breadth but also vocabulary depth in the context of reading research on children who do not speak the majority language.","subject":"German, Vocabulary Development, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Academic Achievement, Writing Skills, Semantics, Native Speakers, Longitudinal Studies, Elementary School Students, Grade 2, Grade 3, Scores, Reading Comprehension, Comparative Analysis, Reading Tests, Language Tests, Nonverbal Ability, Socioeconomic Status","source":"Journal of Research in Reading","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Advanced Placement Course Credit and Undergraduate Student Success in Gateway Science Courses","author":"Fischer, Christian, Witherspoon, Eben, Nguyen, Ha, Feng, Yanan, Fiorini, Stefano, Vincent-Ruz, Paulette, Mead, Chris, Bork Rodriguez, William Nicholas, Matz, Rebecca L., Schunn, Christian","description":"Approximately 2 million students take Advanced Placement (AP) examinations annually.

This study examines the impact of AP credit policies on second-course success in introductory Biology, Chemistry, and Physics course sequences at six large public research universities (N\u00a0=\u00a048,230 students). Applying logistic regression analyses, we found that general performance indicators and measures of systemic inequities during high school were predictive of students earning skip-eligible scores. Interestingly, we descriptively discovered wide variation across institutions and disciplines in the percentage of students who chose to skip when meeting their local policies. However, logistic regression analysis did not find general trends of inequalities for skipping courses for students with skip-eligible scores. We then applied inverse-probability weights with regression adjustment to examine the effects of course skipping. We found that students who skipped their first course with AP credit actually performed similarly well or better in subsequent courses than did students who did not skip, even in contexts where lower AP scores were accepted. Therefore, our study suggests administrators to increase coherence in AP credit policies across departments and disciplines. In particular, we encourage modifying AP credit policies and academic advising to encourage students to skip when they have eligible AP scores. Benefits may include reductions in unnecessary coursework that is burdensome for both students and universities, potentially freeing up resources to better support students who were not privileged to enroll in AP courses during their high school education.","subject":"Advanced Placement, Undergraduate Students, Credits, Educational Policy, Introductory Courses, College Science, Science Instruction, Academic Achievement, Flexible Progression, Academic Advising","source":"Journal of Research in Science Teaching","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Investigating the Professional Adaptation of English Teachers in the First Years of Their Profession to School Environment","author":"Akcan, Sumru, Kirkg\u00f6z, Yasemin, Ersanli, Ceylan Yangin","description":"This study investigates English teachers' socialization to the school environment, their behaviour in the classroom, and their attitudes towards their profession in the first few years after graduation.

To support individualised learning and support proactive scaffolding when students are struggling, game-based learning environments should be able to accurately predict student knowledge at early points in students' gameplay. Student knowledge is traditionally assessed prior to and after each student interacts with the learning environment with conventional methods, such as multiple choice content knowledge assessments. While previous student modelling approaches have leveraged machine learning to automatically infer students' knowledge, there is limited work that incorporates the fine-grained content from each question in these types of tests into student models that predict student performance at early junctures in gameplay episodes. This work investigates a predictive student modelling approach that leverages the natural language text of the post-gameplay content knowledge questions and the text of the possible answer choices for early prediction of fine-grained individual student performance in game-based learning environments. With data from a study involving 66 undergraduate students from a large public university interacting with a game-based learning environment for microbiology, Crystal Island, we investigate the accuracy and early prediction capacity of student models that use a combination of gameplay features extracted from student log files as well as distributed representations of post-test content assessment questions. The results demonstrate that by incorporating knowledge about assessment questions, early prediction models are able to outperform competing baselines that only use student game trace data with no question-related information. Furthermore, this approach achieves high generalisation, including predicting the performance of students on unseen questions.","subject":"Game Based Learning, Natural Language Processing, Prediction, Student Evaluation, Individualized Instruction, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Multiple Choice Tests, Student Characteristics, Models, Undergraduate Students, Microbiology","source":"British Journal of Educational Technology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Rigor by Design, Not Chance: Deeper Thinking through Actionable Instruction and Assessment","author":"Hess, Karin","description":"A practical and systematic approach to deepening student engagement, promoting a growth mindset, and building a classroom culture that truly supports thinking and learning. Every student deserves access to deep and rigorous learning. Still, some persistent myths about rigor can get in the way--such as the belief that it means more or harder work for everyone, rather than challenging and advancing students' thinking. So how can teachers get more clarity on rigor and foster more meaningful learning in their classrooms? In &quot;Rigor by Design, Not Chance,&quot; veteran educator Karin Hess offers not only a clear vision of what makes learning deep and rigorous but also a systematic and equitable approach for engaging students of all ages in rich learning tasks. To that end, she outlines five essential teacher moves that foster thinking and learning: (1) Ask a series of probing questions of increasing complexity; (2) Build schemas in each content area; (3) Consider ways to strategically scaffold learning; (4) Design complex tasks that emphasize transfer and evidence-based solutions; and (5) Engage students in metacognition and reflection throughout the learning process. From there, Hess details how to create an &quot;actionable&quot; assessment cycle that will drive learning forward in any classroom. This book offers a treasure trove of strategies, student &quot;look-for&quot; behaviors, and templates to guide teachers in their work as well as an array of rich performance-based assessments to engage and challenge students. School leaders and instructional coaches can also benefit from the variety of teacher-friendly supports to foster rigorous learning in their schools.

In this report, the authors describe how Delaware's LEAs spent their Opportunity Funding and SSBG dollars, what portion of their allocations they spent, and what LEA leaders deemed their most effective investments with those dollars. They also examine whether both the allocation of the funds and the actual expenditures were associated with improved performance on spring 2022 math and reading tests. The authors use and report results from multiple quantitative designs, including cross-state comparisons of academic achievement, comparisons of the size of academic achievement gaps before and after the availability of funds, and comparisons of academic achievement between schools that did and did not expend these funds. Since the 2019-2020 school year, the Opportunity Funding and SSBG programs have allocated nearly $100 million to Delaware LEAs to support student learning and well-being, with particular emphasis on supporting SEPs and MLs. Delaware LEAs have used these funds to make hundreds of investments, most of which are the employment of staff dedicated to support reading instruction, MLs, and student mental health.

In this study, we\u00a0place MLD research in its wider context of risk societies by discussing the manufacturing of MLD as &quot;a risk.&quot; This framing of MLD builds on a certain idea of &quot;hope&quot; in how research could provide the means to better understand and support learners with MLD. We conduct a Foucault-informed analysis to understand how scholarly knowledge about MLD has been produced through discourses of risk and hope. Our material consists of 30 influential journal articles published in the three fields of MLD research: cognitive sciences, special education and mathematics education. Our study indicates that MLD has been predominantly conceptualised through a technico-scientific risk discourse that frames MLD as harmful for learners and societies alike; such risk discourse relies on a discourse of hope in scientific methods. We also analyse a social risk discourse that identifies risks in social exclusion and marginalisation of students with MLD, finding hope in inclusive learning environments. Based on our analysis, we propose that the mere conceptualisation of MLD has thoroughly revolved around discourses of current liminalities (&quot;risk&quot;) and enunciations of better futures (&quot;hope&quot;). However, what has been unexplored is the politics of such risk and hope discourses themselves. We propose a socio-politically oriented discourse of risk\/hope as a way to reframe scientific knowledge production about MLD. This discourse identifies risks not in MLD itself but in how research manufactures MLD as a threat to both economic growth and student identities.\u00a0Instead of asking\u00a0research communities to mitigate the risk\u00a0of MLD, we call for them to\u00a0embrace it.","subject":"Mathematics Instruction, Learning Problems, Learning Disabilities, Risk, Psychological Patterns, Journal Articles, Educational Philosophy, Special Education, Mathematics Education, Discourse Analysis, Scientific Research, Disadvantaged, Social Isolation, Inclusion, Social Influences, Political Influences, Economic Development, Self Concept","source":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Assessing Opportunities for Self-Study and Out-of-Class Activities in a Prescriptive High Contact-Hour Engineering Curriculum","author":"Ezika, Ijeoma J. F., Ndu, Ijeoma, Chukwueke, Tochukwu Clinton, Iloanusi, Ogechukwu N.","description":"Contribution: This work identifies some attributes of a prescriptive high contact-hour engineering curriculum that could be limiting the development of core skills among engineering students. The findings are put together to develop a guideline for curriculum review that optimizes characteristic student academic hours for in- and out-of-class educational activities. Background: One of the identified factors that contribute to developing core technical and soft skills among engineering students is the amount and nature of the academic workload stipulated by the curriculum. An implication of a curriculum with a high quantity of instruction (QI) (class contact hours) is a deficiency in self-directed learning; an activity believed to support the development of critical thinking and lifelong learning skills among students. Research Question: (1) How does the QI of a prescriptive high contact-hour engineering program affect the time for self-study (TSS)? (2) Are there some features of the curriculum of such programs that can be adapted for controlling QI and TSS? Methodology: A narrative review of a curriculum guideline document was carried out. Using an earlier proposed model that expresses TSS as a function of QI, an analysis of TSS and QI characteristics of six universities awarding the same engineering degree was presented. Findings: Given an average weekly contact hour of 27.75, students in the studied engineering programs are likely to have 60% less TSS in comparison to global counterparts. By addressing some characteristics of the curriculum, these numbers can be improved for more out-of-class activities that foster the development of core technical and soft skills.","subject":"Independent Study, Extracurricular Activities, Engineering Education, Curriculum Design, Critical Thinking, Lifelong Learning, Time Factors (Learning), Skill Development, Soft Skills","source":"IEEE Transactions on Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Paediatric Manikins and School Nurses as Basic Life Support Coordinators: A Useful Strategy for Schools?","author":"Otero-Agra, Mart\u00edn, Rey-Fern\u00e1ndez, Luz, Pacheco-Rodr\u00edguez, David, Fern\u00e1ndez-M\u00e9ndez, Felipe, Barcala-Furelos, Roberto, Greif, Robert","description":"Objective: To evaluate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills performance and retention in schoolchildren aged 8 to 12 years following instruction by their teachers and with the guidance of a school nurse using paediatric manikins. Design: Descriptive simulation trial. Method: A school nurse provided support to six schoolteachers as they taught a modified 40-minute CPR course. Pupils were shown an out-of-hospital cardiac-arrest recognition video followed by a CPR simulation using paediatric manikins. 117 schoolchildren aged 8 to 12 years received the training. Both the schoolchildren and teachers completed a survey before and afterwards. Children completed an out-of-hospital cardiac-arrest recognition test and a 1-minute CPR test 1 week later. Results: After training, schoolchildren increased their self-efficacy as rescuers (8 \u00b1 2 vs 10 \u00b1 2; p &lt; 0.001). Irrespective of age differences, 74% of schoolchildren performed the entire out-of-hospital cardiac-arrest recognition sequence correctly. Children aged 11 to 12 years and 10 to 11 years performed higher quality CPR (49% and 47%, respectively) compared to 8 to 9 year olds (14%, p = 0.008 and p = 0.014). Children aged 11 to 12 years outperformed younger children aged 8 to 9 years with respect to compression depth (48 \u00b1 6 mm vs 43 \u00b1 5 mm, p = 0.008) Conclusion: Schoolchildren's teachers, who were guided by a nurse using paediatric manikins, taught children aged 10 to 12 years to perform high-quality CPR. We suggest integrating paediatric manikins as part of children's CPR training as feedback from successful CPR performance increases motivation and confidence to act as a rescuer as well as improves skills retention.","subject":"Simulation, Pediatrics, School Nurses, First Aid, Elementary School Students, Retention (Psychology), Skill Development, Health Education, Self Efficacy, Health Programs, Foreign Countries, Physical Characteristics","source":"Health Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Spain"},{"title":"Investigation of Students&apos; Cognitive Structures Concerning the Topic of Physical and Chemical Changes: A Cross-Level Study","author":"Nakiboglu, Canan","description":"The topic of physical and chemical changes is one of the basic and essential issues of both the lowersecondary school science curriculum and the upper-secondary school chemistry curriculum in many countries. The focus of the present study is to investigate the students' cognitive structures on the topic of physical and chemical changes at different grade levels and to compare how the aspects of students' cognitive structures differ at 8th, 9th, and 10th-grade levels. The data were collected from a total of 388 students (126 8th-graders, 129 9th-graders, and 133 10th-graders) through using a word association test (WAT) which contains eight stimulus words. Both the relatedness coefficient (RC) method and the response frequency mapping method were used in the analysis of the data and mapping of the group cognitive structures of the students. The variables related to the concepts or ideas contained, the connections between the concepts, and the information processing skills, which are the three main aspects in defining the cognitive structures, are compared according to the grade level. It has been concluded that the cognitive structure of the 9th-grade students is the most comprehensive, and integrated, and has a higher information retrieval rate. On the other hand, when the data obtained from both the RC values and the response frequency mappings were examined, it was found that there were also several similarities in the cognitive structures of the three grade levels. For instance, the relationship level of the stimulus word 'energy' with other stimulus words is very weak at all grade levels.","subject":"Chemistry, Science Instruction, Secondary School Students, Cognitive Structures, Comparative Analysis, Instructional Program Divisions, Language Tests, Vocabulary, Word Frequency, Scientific Concepts, Concept Formation, Cognitive Processes, Associative Learning, Energy, Test Validity, Foreign Countries","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"Integrating Chemistry Laboratory-Tutorial Timetabling with Instructional Design and the Impact on Learner Perceptions and Outcomes","author":"Lau, Poh Nguk, Teow, Yiwei, Low, Xin Tian Tammy, Tan, Shi Ting Bernice","description":"For chemistry, where learners are required to integrate experimental observations with theoretical knowledge, laboratory work appears to be a viable instructional strategy. However, research has shown that chemistry laboratory instruction often fails to live up to its potential. The scheduling practice in higher education (HE) separating theory lessons and practical work into temporally disjointed sessions could exacerbate the theory-laboratory disconnect. This paper continues an earlier work, in which integrated schedules of chemistry tutorial and laboratory classes were implemented in two general chemistry courses in a freshman chemical engineering programme. Traditionally separate tutorial and laboratory classes were chained into 3 hour blocks in the experimental classes. Worked examples, group presentations and course materials designed as a merged package to connect theory with practical work were implemented for selected tasks in integrated teaching. Prior ability was measured based on previous titration experience or grades in earlier general chemistry courses. Lesson experiences were collected on the validated Meaningful Learning in the Laboratory Instrument (MLLI) (Galloway and Bretz, 2015). Block (or integrated) and traditional learners performed equally on theory tests, but integrated learners scored higher on a titration skills assessment. The origin of differences in skills performance could not be ascertained conclusively. Perceptions across the MLLI domains declined across schedules, with significant losses in the cognitive domain. MLLI scores did not differ by schedules. There is some evidence favouring stronger theory-laboratory connection from the qualitative MLLI data and the focus group interviews, although cognitive overloading may adversely impact low ability learners. This work showed that block scheduling does not affect the chemistry skills-set equally, which opens the topic for future research. Suggestions for future implementation of chemistry block teaching were also proposed.","subject":"Chemistry, Science Laboratories, Tutorial Programs, Scheduling, Instructional Design, Outcomes of Education, College Freshmen, Engineering Education, Theory Practice Relationship, Scores, Cognitive Processes, Difficulty Level","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"&quot;Preparing Them for the Profession&quot;: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of Anatomy Educators Coping with Complexity in the United Kingdom Curriculum","author":"Kirkness, Karen B., Bazira, Peter J., Finn, Gabrielle M., Nizza, Isabella E.","description":"Efforts to integrate the basic sciences into the ever-changing curriculum are a trending area of research in health professions education. Low-stakes, high-frequency assessment methods such as the progress test are now widely implemented in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland as a means of furthering curricular integration toward contemporary goals of competency and professional identity formation. The anatomy educator's experience vis-\u00e0-vis these curricular changes is not well understood. This study aimed to explore how anatomy educators make sense of the shifting demands of their role. The interviews were semi-structured, particularly concerned with the phenomenon of teachers adapting to the complexity of their learning environment. The study used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to focus on the lived experiences of participants coping with the phenomena in question: how do anatomy educators make sense of the learning environment in the United Kingdom? Interviews were transcribed verbatim and interpreted inductively, identifying four key themes: confidence through connectedness, variations in appraisals of curricular integration, managing expectations to perform in paradoxical situations, and the emergence of innovative teaching. Results point to the learning environment as a complex system and highlight the importance of feeling support from and connection to colleagues, enabling individual educators to develop confidence, meet the top-down demands of changing curricula, and experience personal identity development and uncertainty tolerance within their role. This IPA study offers insight into the lived experiences of anatomy educators whose experiential interpretations of a complex and changing curriculum can uniquely inform stakeholders in health professions education.","subject":"Anatomy, Science Instruction, Phenomenology, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Allied Health Occupations Education, Integrated Curriculum, Professional Identity, Educational Change, Curriculum Development, Instructional Innovation, Teaching Experience","source":"Anatomical Sciences Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"United Kingdom, United Kingdom (Northern Ireland)"},{"title":"&quot;A Whole New Perspective on How the Body Fits Together&quot;--An Evaluation of a Cadaver Laboratory Experience for High School Students","author":"Cale, Andrew S., Byram, Jessica N., Organ, Jason M., Schmalz, Naomi A.","description":"The Center for Anatomy and Physiology Education has hosted interactive human cadaver laboratory tours for local high schools (ages 14-18) and undergraduate university students since 2014 to expose students to healthcare careers. Students receive information on the history of body donation and healthcare careers and observe human anatomy on prosections and with isolated organs. The goal of this study was to evaluate students' perceptions of the anatomy laboratory tours and their impact on students' interests in healthcare careers. Students completed pre- and post-tour questionnaires. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and linguistic inquiry. Of the 261 students who completed pre-tour questionnaires, 204 (78%) completed the post-tour questionnaire. Before the tour, students anticipated learning about human anatomy and expected to only see but not touch a cadaver. Most students expressed excitement and\/or nervousness. A few students viewed the laboratory tour as an opportunity to test if they could see themselves in a healthcare career. After the tour, most students indicated that the tour either met or exceeded their expectations. Students found the laboratory tour to be educational and interesting and were surprised by the opportunity to interact with the donor. Numerous students expressed an increased interest in healthcare careers after the tour. Overall, students perceived the tour as an engaging experience that improved their anatomical knowledge and reinforced\/increased their interest in healthcare careers. Academic institutions can positively impact local students by implementing an anatomy tour, sharing access to their in-house human cadaver laboratory, and recruiting instructors to share their anatomy expertise.","subject":"High School Students, Anatomy, Science Laboratories, Field Trips, Experiential Learning, Human Body, Death, Health Services, Occupational Aspiration, Student Interests, Learner Engagement, Knowledge Level, Active Learning, Science Instruction","source":"Anatomical Sciences Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Social Media and Literacy Education: An Evaluation of Turkish Teaching Accounts on Instagram","author":"Simsek, Tugba","description":"Along with the developments in technology, education and training activities have been moved to different channels. Social media, used by young and old alike, are also seen as educational tools. When we searched Instagram for Turkish language teaching accounts with the highest number of users, we found eight active and effective accounts. The aim of this study is to examine these accounts that were opened to teach Turkish, to examine their shares and their effects on followers, and to reveal their contributions to literacy education. For this purpose, document analysis and discourse analysis were used. The accounts were examined in terms of page layout, content, frequency of posts, way of handling Turkish, and methods used in teaching the language. In addition, the interaction with the followers, the number of likes, comments, the frequency responses was discussed and the effect values of the commented accounts on the followers were explored. As a result, it has been determined that there is no certain standard in the analyzed accounts. It was observed that the most followed pages shared posts about the exams held throughout the country, giving summary information, and explaining the answers to the questions. Since all these posts are mostly aimed at reading skills, it can be concluded that the followers improve their reading skills. As evident from followers' comments, they develop literacy skills by reading the information given in these accounts and writing them in the comments. In addition, it is seen that these pages, which were opened to teach Turkish, were mostly opened by Turkish language and Turkish literature teachers. Considering that the use of technology is increasing, we believe that the study will contribute to the field of language education and literacy.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Social Media, Literacy Education, Turkish, Native Language Instruction, Educational Benefits, Interaction, Language Teachers","source":"International Journal of Education and Literacy Studies","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"University-School Interaction in Implementing Game-Based Learning for Creative Thinking Development","author":"Chen, Xufeng","description":"The educational process increasingly shifts towards the use of digital technologies every year. The change refers to all forms of education, namely primary, secondary, and higher.

The research paper aimed to assess the effect of teaching on creative thinking in future teachers and primary schoolchildren. To this end, 28 students have been invited to teach the introduction to programming course within their internship to develop primary schoolchildren's creative thinking. The children were divided into two groups. The control group studied in the classroom, while the experimental one learned remotely via videoconferencing. Participants in both groups showed good, high, and very high levels of mastery of the course, which confirmed both approaches' suitability for effective learning. In evaluating the effectiveness of game-based programming instruction in person and remotely with trainees, it was found that the control (offline learning) group had a slight advantage in the final mean score. Meanwhile, the highest score was observed in the experimental group ([alpha] = 0.05 and the calculated value X[superscript 2] = 8.04). At the same time, the given hypothesis of the trainees' improved creative thinking as a result of teaching the course was confirmed - the average score before the test was 65.3 vs. 89 after the test (the calculated value of Student's t-test is 4.89 with a critical value of 2.26). The present findings are equally useful for university teachers\/student teachers and school teachers\/administration.

Amazon Alexa has a unique feature among modern text-to-speech vocalizers as she can infuse enthusiasm cues into her synthetic voice. In this first study examining modern text-to-speech voice enthusiasm effects in a multimedia learning environment, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted where learners from a large Asian university (n = 244) listened to either Alexa's: (1) neutral voice, (2) low-enthusiastic voice, (3) medium-enthusiastic voice, or (4) high-enthusiastic voice, narrating a multimedia lesson on distributed denial-of-service attack. While Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not enhance persona ratings compared to Alexa's neutral voice, learners could infer more enthusiasm expressed by Alexa's medium-and high-enthusiastic voices than Alexa's neutral voice. Regarding cognitive load, Alexa's low-and high-enthusiastic voices decreased intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load ratings compared to Alexa's neutral voice. While Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not impact affective-motivational ratings differently from Alexa's neutral voice, learners reported a significant increase of positive emotions from their baseline positive emotions after listening to Alexa's medium-enthusiastic voice. Finally, Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not enhance the learning performance on immediate retention and transfer tests compared to Alexa's neutral voice. This study demonstrates that a modern text-to-speech voice enthusiasm can positively affect learners' emotions and cognitive load during multimedia learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed through the lens of the Cognitive Affective Model of E-learning, Integrated-Cognitive Affective Model of Learning with Multimedia, and Cognitive Load Theory.

These four public schools were selected because prior to when the study was conducted all were part of the Bicentennial Schools Programme led by the Ministry of Education from 2010 to 2014. The aim of the programme was to develop effective secondary schools to serve low-income students. A thematic analysis of data produced through individual and group interviews and observations of departmental meetings shows that the enactment of performance-based accountability involved two dimensions of learning-centred leadership, distributed among senior leaders and department heads. An aim shared by parents, students, teachers and senior leaders was to ensure students' access to, and completion of, studies in higher education. Attaining good scores in national standardised SIMCE tests was key to meeting the vision. Collective trust among all actors and macro level trust in standardised testing served as a resource for strong collaboration to improve instruction and learning as well as teachers' collective efficacy. The discussion focuses on school-level practices and policy-level decisions that create conditions for the effective use of information produced from standardised assessments.

However, students in the United States consistently underperform on science achievement tests compared to students from other nations. This underperformance could be attributed, in part to science having many specialized vocabulary terms that are not often taught explicitly, leaving students with incomplete or inaccurate understandings of word meanings. Improving science vocabulary instructional practices may support students with and without DB disabilities in enhancing their science achievement. To address this need, researchers implemented multicomponent multimedia professional development (PD) to support middle-school science teachers in delivering high-quality vocabulary instruction in inclusive settings. In this paper, data collected from a study evaluating the efficacy of the PD were analyzed to determine the influence on student outcomes using ANOVA and multilevel modeling methodologies. Though initial results indicate a promising impact on teacher instructional practices, little is known whether teacher participation in the PD affected student science vocabulary and content knowledge growth. Using multilevel modeling, student science knowledge growth was evaluated following their teachers' exposure to the PD. The findings from this study indicate having indirect exposure to PD had a positive effect on science content knowledge for students with and without DB disabilities (N\u00a0=\u00a0980).

We conducted a systematic review showing that pre-event instructions, instructions given before event exposure, are rarely reported and those that are reported vary in the extent to which they warn participants about the nature of the event or tasks. At odds with the experience of actual witnesses, some studies use pre-event instructions explicitly warning participants of the upcoming crime and lineup task.

The findings show that the majority of respondents prefer to use their L2 in speaking classes and believe that L2 should be the prior language in general speaking classes. More than two-thirds of the respondents prefer to use L2 when they want to communicate with each other inside and outside of the classroom and prefer to use L2 in doing their assignments or performing orally in class. More than half of the respondents prefer to use L2 in assessment sessions.","subject":"Native Language, Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Student Attitudes, Undergraduate Students, Islam, Religious Colleges, Comparative Analysis, Foreign Countries, Factor Analysis, Correlation, Language Usage, Preferences, Language Attitudes, Speech Communication","source":"Language Testing in Asia","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Iran (Tehran)"},{"title":"Learning to Become Ignorant: Improving the Quality of Epistemic Knowledge in Science Education","author":"Tan, Michael, Koh, Teck Seng","description":"In considering goals for science education, it is conventional to make arguments for the utility of scientific knowledge for a variety of purposes. Less prominent are rationales based on the beauty or truth of science. In this paper, we examine how an approach to science education might be different if we shift the goals of communication to an appreciation of the ways in which our knowledge is limited, and how the practical boundaries of our knowledge can be closer than we think--in other words, &quot;how&quot; we are collectively ignorant. Key to this approach is a renewed understanding of the role of material investigations in providing partial knowledge. Instead of providing incontrovertible evidence, empirical investigations provide a form of &quot;explanatory excess&quot; whereby the appropriate choice of explanation is not necessarily one that can be simplistically determined. Although\u00a0scientific practices provide techniques to &quot;minimize&quot; the possibility of error in making our conclusions, these practices are performed by fallible human communities, from which the notion of &quot;tentative, yet durable&quot; claims derives. We argue that public scientific literacy may be better served by more circumspect claims of validity, and crucially, an enhanced understanding of the ways in which materiality influences epistemic processes and limits our claims. We illustrate these proposals through the case of the International Young Physicists' Tournament, a contest that invites participants to play with interesting physical phenomena for over a year. We identify three factors prominent in these tournament problems that present possibilities for increasing the authenticity of practical investigations. These are (i) multiple physical interactions in phenomena leading to the openness of choice of explanatory theory; (ii) the qualitative, subjective nature of the explanatory utility of theories; and (iii) the material contingency of empirical investigations. We argue that a more open-handed embrace of the limits of our knowledge may serve as a better epistemic orientation for science instruction.","subject":"Science Education, Classroom Communication, Knowledge Level, Evidence, Investigations, Scientific Literacy, Epistemology","source":"Science Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"How Students Reason about Matter Flows and Accumulations in Complex Biological Phenomena: An Emerging Learning Progression for Mass Balance","author":"Scott, Emily E., Cerchiara, Jack, McFarland, Jenny L., Wenderoth, Mary Pat, Doherty, Jennifer H.","description":"In recent years, there has been a strong push to transform STEM education at K-12 and collegiate levels to help students learn to think like scientists. One aspect of this transformation involves redesigning instruction and curricula around fundamental scientific ideas that serve as conceptual scaffolds students can use to build cohesive knowledge structures. In this study, we investigated how students use mass balance reasoning as a conceptual scaffold to gain a deeper understanding of how matter moves through biological systems. Our aim was to lay the groundwork for a mass balance learning progression in physiology. We drew on a general models framework from biology and a covariational reasoning framework from math education to interpret students' mass balance ideas. We used a constant comparative method to identify students' reasoning patterns from 73 interviews conducted with undergraduate biology students. We helped validate the reasoning patterns identified with &gt;8000 written responses collected from students at multiple institutions. From our analyses, we identified two related progress variables that describe key elements of students' performances: the first describes how students identify and use matter flows in biology phenomena; the second characterizes how students use net rate-of-change to predict how matter accumulates in, or disperses from, a compartment. We also present a case study of how we used our emerging mass balance learning progression to inform instructional practices to support students' mass balance reasoning. Our progress variables describe one way students engage in three dimensional learning by showing how student performances associated with the practice of mathematical thinking reveal their understanding of the core concept of matter flows as governed by the crosscutting concept of matter conservation. Though our work is situated in physiology, it extends previous work in climate change education and is applicable to other scientific fields, such as physics, engineering, and geochemistry.","subject":"Thinking Skills, Science Education, Scientific Concepts, Curriculum Development, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Undergraduate Students, Cognitive Processes, Biology","source":"Journal of Research in Science Teaching","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Documenting L2 Input and Interaction during Study Abroad: Approaches, Instruments and Challenges","author":"Mitchell, Rosamond","description":"A major rationale for study abroad (SA) from the perspective of second language acquisition is the presumed opportunity available to sojourners for naturalistic second language (L2) &quot;immersion&quot;. However, such opportunities are affected by variations in the linguistic, institutional and social affordances of SA, in different settings. They are also affected by the varying agency and motivation of sojourners in seeking second language (L2) engagement. For example, many sojourners prioritize mastering informal L2 speech, while others prioritize academic and professional registers including writing. Most will operate multilingually, using their home language, a local language, and\/or English as lingua franca for different purposes, and the types of input they seek out, and language practices they enter into, vary accordingly. Consequently, while researchers have developed varied approaches to documenting L2 engagement, and have tried to relate these to measures of L2 development, these efforts have so far seen somewhat mixed success. This article reviews different approaches to documenting SA input and interaction; first, that of participant self-report, using questionnaires, interviews, journals, or language logs. Particular attention is paid to the popular Language Contact Profile (LCP), and to approaches drawing on Social Network Analysis. The limitations of all forms of self-report are acknowledged. The article also examines the contribution of direct observation and recording of L2 input and interaction during SA. This is a significant alternative approach for the study of acquisition, but one which poses theoretical, ethical and practical challenges. Researchers have increasingly enlisted participants as research collaborators who create small corpora through self-recording with L2 interlocutors. Analyses in this tradition have so far prioritized interactional, pragmatic and sociocultural development, in learner corpora, over other dimensions of second language acquisition (SLA). The theoretical and practical challenges of corpus creation in SA settings and their wider use to promote understandings of informal L2 learning are discussed.","subject":"Linguistic Input, Study Abroad, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Learning Motivation, Outcomes of Education, Learner Engagement, Multilingualism, Language Usage, Intercultural Communication, Profiles, Social Networks, Network Analysis, Computational Linguistics, Pragmatics, Informal Education, Cultural Awareness, Social Influences, Spanish, Barriers, Rating Scales, Student Attitudes, Diaries","source":"Second Language Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"History of Science in Two Recent Versions of High School Physics Textbooks in China","author":"Lin, Lin, Song, Qianru, Wang, Jingying, Hu, Tao, Ping, Xiaomei, Ling, Yizhou","description":"The history of science has a unique value to teaching, and textbooks play an important role in permeating the history of science in science courses. This study aims to compare the presentation of history of science in two versions of high school physics textbooks in China. We selected the 2019 edition of the national and local textbooks as samples. The revised Leite's checklist is used to conduct statistics and comparative analysis on the history of science content in the two versions of textbooks, referred to as the PEP and Luke versions described in more detail in the paper. The results show that, in terms of the quantity and presentation of the history of science, the PEP version contains more history of science, while the Luke version presents the historical content more intuitively. In terms of the type and organization of the history of science, the Luke version describes scientists and the type of evolution in more detail. In the presentation of the history of science, both of the two versions of textbooks are mainly based on texts written by textbook authors, supplemented by pictures of scientists and instruments. In the description of the contexts of the history of science, both tend to use the scientific context to present the history of science. In terms of the status of the history of science content, it mostly acts as a fundamental role in the Luke version while plays a complementary one in the PEP version. As for the learning activities related to the history of science, both tend to set up normal-level activities. The two versions of textbooks are relatively poor in the internal consistency of the textbooks with respect to the historical information and interdisciplinary activity design. Only Compulsory Book 1 of PEP version has the content of history of science as bibliography, and both of the two versions of textbooks seldom have history of science books as its bibliography.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Secondary Education, Physics, Science Curriculum, Science Instruction, Textbook Content, Educational History, Textbook Evaluation, Content Analysis","source":"Science & Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"title":"The Impact of Physics Education Technology (PhET) Interactive Simulation-Based Learning on Motivation and Academic Achievement among Malawian Physics Students","author":"Banda, Herbert James, Nzabahimana, Joseph","description":"The study investigated the impact of PhET simulation-based learning on students' motivation and academic achievement in learning oscillations and waves among Malawian secondary students.

(iii) Is the change in post-test scores due to the students' characteristics in non-randomized settings or the PhET interactive simulation-based learning? A sample of 280 (44.6% females) form three secondary school students with a mean age of 17.5 (SD = 1.424) from four schools in Blantyre urban district in Malawi was used in a quasi-experimental design of non-equivalent groups. The experimental group was exposed to PhET simulation-based learning, while the conventional teaching methods were used in the control group. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data on academic achievement, and questionnaires collected data on motivation. Independent samples t-test showed a statistical difference between the two groups on post-test of the academic achievement. Results from linear regression indicated that the differences between the two groups in the post-test were not due to students' characteristics but rather the intervention with p &lt; 0.01. The ANCOVA test on motivation constructs showed a significant difference with a small effect size between the study groups on self-efficacy, active learning strategies, performance goals, achievement goals, learning environment stimulation, and attitudes towards learning with computer learning.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop and implement the necessary early intervention programs in relation to mathematics education. Studies indicate that early mathematics education intervention programs provide an increase in children's mathematical knowledge levels improving their mathematics performance. It is also reported that such programs are effective in increasing the mathematical achievement of children at risk and that their effects may last for a longer time. Therefore, it is considered important to support the mathematics skills of the children in the risk group with early mathematics intervention programs, to identify the children whose mathematical skills are deficient or who have not acquired these skills sufficiently in the early period. In this study the is aim to reveal the effectiveness of an intervention program developed in relation to the early mathematics skills to improve such skills of children in the pre-school period between 60-72 months of age, who are in the risk group in terms of mathematics skills. In this study, the multiple probe model inter-subjects, which is one of the single-subject research models, was used. The participants of the study were three kindergarten students from three different schools in Kirsehir, T\u00fcrkiye. The study was carried out in the special education center located in the said city. The data collection tool is an early mathematics intervention program developed for teaching early mathematics skills. When we look at the findings obtained from the study in general, it appears that the early mathematics intervention program was effective in improving the early mathematics skills of all three students. For this reason, priority should be given to supporting the development of early mathematics skills in all children attending pre-school education institutions.","subject":"Early Intervention, Mathematics Skills, Preschool Children, At Risk Students, Program Effectiveness, Preschool Education, Preschool Teachers, Special Education, Mathematics Instruction, Foreign Countries, Students with Disabilities","source":"Participatory Educational Research","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"Distance Education as a Tool to Improve Researchers&apos; Knowledge on Predatory Journals in Countries with Limited Resources: The Moroccan Experience","author":"El Bairi, Khalid, Fourtassi, Maryam, El Fatimy, Rachid, El Kadmiri, Nadia","description":"The emergence of predatory journals is a global threat for scientific integrity, particularly in under-resourced settings such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A bilingual course on predatory publishing using a distance education approach was developed for Moroccan researchers as a response to the imperative need for training on research ethics to implement good scientific practices. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted to evaluate outcomes after delivering two education sessions in both French and English. Before this course, 40% of participants indicated that they don't verify journal quality before manuscript submission and most of them consider Scopus indexing and the impact factor as the best criteria for journal publication. Approximately 50% of surveyees did not have previous information on predatory journals before the webinar. Pressure to publish by supervisors, institutions of affiliation, or funding agencies, was noticed in 43.4% of participants. After the webinar course was delivered, remarkably, the proportion of participants with knowledge on predatory publishing was meaningfully increased from 48.9% to 81%. Importantly, 83.7% of participants indicated that they are motivated to share their new knowledge on predatory publishing with their colleagues. Moreover, the majority of respondents (73.8%) reported that publishing their research in predatory journals may damage their career and professional future. Promisingly, nearly a half or more of participants recommended the use of training based on distance education, surveillance of researchers by their mentors and affiliations, and social networks to increase awareness on predatory publishing.

Teachers from all disciplines and levels can create a full spectrum of engaging exercises through the authors' six accessible ALLURE steps: (1) Ask where to apply the play; (2) List the mental moves; (3) Link the mental moves to the play; (4) Understand how the learning principles operate; (5) Run the activity-game; and (6) Evaluate the learner experience. Along with principles from game-based learning pedagogy, readers will explore a framework of original complex mechanic teaching templates that will help their fledgling instructional activities cross the bridge into fully formed games. Beginners and veterans will find multiple entry points, from adding a single playful element (student roles in discussions) to more elaborate designs (riddles and simulations). They will also learn different levels of producing physical tabletop components (cards, boards, plastic pieces) or light digital options (discussion board riddles, Google Slides games). Born from the authors' extensive experiences running professional development workshops, this guide has been frequently requested by classroom teachers, college instructors, librarians, and instructional designers. While examples are all drawn from secondary and higher education environments, the ALLURE method is also being used in workshops with elementary-level teachers, including homeschool instructors; business trainers; and digital and analogue game designers. This book: (1) Offers hands-on, practical advice about how to be more playful with your students, with a focus on nondigital activities and games; (2) Is written in the language of instructional design, so advanced knowledge about games or technology is not required; (3) Provides creative instructional techniques that will boost student engagement for both in-person and online instruction; (4) Includes more than two dozen original illustrations and designs to aid understanding; and (5) Addresses the need for accessible, inclusive learning environments.

One of the reasons for this is the lack of tried-and-tested inquiry-based teaching materials with detailed guides that teachers can readily use in their classrooms. As part of a four-year research project, new teaching materials were designed to foster scientific reasoning and scientific process skills in chemistry education in Hungary. From these materials, in this study, a guided inquiry-based chemistry task was tested with 9th-grade students (N = 88) who had no previous experience with the method. Before the activity, the students' mid-term grades were collected, and the Lawson Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR) was administered to describe the sample. During the activity, students worked in groups (n = 21). Data were collected through content analysis of the student worksheets, classroom observations using a rubric, and student questionnaires to explore the learning paths and identify possible obstacles. Our findings support that guided inquiry learning is suitable for students who are new to the method if appropriate scaffolding is given. The data showed the phases of the inquiry cycle in which more guidance is necessary. Formulating hypotheses, recording observations, and evaluating the hypotheses based on the evidence were found to be the most critical steps in the learning process. More than half of the groups disregarded the collected evidence and accepted their original hypotheses, despite their unproven validity, suggesting that they did not understand the true nature of the scientific inquiry. Chemistry grades and the LCTSR scores could not predict reliably the students' success in solving the inquiry task. The results of the student questionnaire showed that the students enjoyed the inquiry session. They mostly found their work successful, but they overestimated the level of their inquiry skills in some cases.","subject":"Chemistry, Science Instruction, Secondary School Teachers, Cooperative Learning, Inquiry, Active Learning, Student Attitudes, Scoring Rubrics, Worksheets, Instructional Materials, Grade 9, Science Process Skills, Thinking Skills, Science Tests, Barriers, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Foreign Countries","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"title":"Messages about Valued Knowledge Products and Processes Embedded within a Suite of Transformed High School Chemistry Curricular Materials","author":"Schafer, Adam G. L., Kuborn, Thomas M., Schwarz, Cara E., Deshaye, Megan Y., Stowe, Ryan L.","description":"The way high school chemistry curricula are structured has the potential to convey consequential messages about knowledge and knowing to students and teachers. If a curriculum is built around practicing skills and recalling facts to reach ''correct'' answers, it is unlikely class activities will be seen (by students or the teacher) as opportunities to figure out causes for phenomena. Our team of teachers and researchers is working to understand how enactment of transformed curricular materials can support high school chemistry students in making sense of perplexing, relatable phenomena. Given this goal, we were surprised to see that co-developers who enacted our materials overwhelmingly emphasized the importance of acquiring true facts\/skills when writing weekly reflections. Recognition that teachers' expressed aims did not align with our stated goal of ''supporting molecular-level sensemaking'' led us to examine whether the tacit epistemological commitments reflected by our materials were, in fact, consistent with a course focused on figuring out phenomena. We described several aspects of each lesson in our two-semester curriculum including: the role of phenomena in lesson activities, the extent to which lessons were 3-dimensional, the role of student ideas in class dialogue, and who established coherence between lessons. Triangulation of these lesson features enabled us to infer messages about valued knowledge products and processes materials had the potential to send. We observed that our materials commonly encouraged students to mimic the structure of science practices for the purpose of being evaluated by the teacher. That is, students were asked to ''go through the motions'' of explaining, modeling etc. but had little agency regarding the sorts of models and explanations they found productive in their class community. This study serves to illustrate the importance of surfacing the tacit epistemological commitments that guide curriculum development. Additionally, it extends existing scholarship on epistemological messaging by considering curricular materials as a potentially consequential sources of messages.","subject":"Secondary School Science, Chemistry, Science Instruction, Instructional Materials, Science Curriculum, Epistemology, Teaching Methods, High School Teachers, Science Teachers","source":"Chemistry Education Research and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"A Closer Look at the Domain-Specific Associations of Openness with Language Achievement: Evidence on the Role of Intrinsic Value from Two Large-Scale Longitudinal Studies","author":"Meyer, Jennifer, Schmidt, Fabian T.

Regarding the personality traits described in the five-factor model, prior research has shown associations between openness to experience and language achievement in particular. Following the principle of trait activation, associations with intrinsic value can explain these domain-specific relationships of openness with achievement. Aims: This study investigated whether intrinsic value mediates the associations of openness to experience with language achievement to understand these associations more closely. Based on the principle of trait activation, we combined openness to experience with intrinsic value as a motivational construct more proximal to behaviour. Samples: We capitalized on two large-scale longitudinal data sets (N = 1994; M = 16.8 years; 51% female; and N = 2722; M = 17.34 years; 58% female) of German-speaking students in upper secondary education with two points of measurement, respectively. Methods: We assessed achievement using report card grades and standardized test scores, capturing three language subskills: reading and listening, measured by standardized tests, and writing competencies, measured by essay assignments. We conducted mediation analysis using bootstrapped confidence intervals and robust standard errors to account for dependencies in the data due to students clustered within classrooms. Results and Conclusions: Overall, our results show that intrinsic value mediated the relationship between openness and achievement in English as a foreign language. The results remained stable when controlling for prior achievement, predicting achievement gains. Our investigation provides empirical insights into the manifestations of personality in academic contexts. We discuss the limitations of our approach, with a focus on the use of a mediation analysis in this research design.","subject":"Longitudinal Studies, German, Personality Traits, Student Motivation, Personality Measures, Secondary School Students, Report Cards, Language Tests, Scores, Standardized Tests, Language Skills, Essays, Assignments, Error of Measurement, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Native Language, Achievement Gains, Correlation, Grades (Scholastic)","source":"British Journal of Educational Psychology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"The Intersectionality of Teacher Immediacy, Emotioncy and Willingness to Communicate in Higher Education Context","author":"Amini, Asieh, Weisi, Hiwa","description":"Purpose: Given the significance of willingness to communicate and its integral role in the field of foreign\/second language acquisition (F\/SLA), this quantitative study intends to examine the relationship between sensory emotioncy types and teacher immediacy with second language learners' willingness to communicate (WTC). Design\/methodology\/approach: A total number of 280 students majoring in teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), and English Language and Literature completed three scales of Sensory Emotioncy Type (SET), Willingness to Communicate and Teacher Immediacy (TI). For data analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed. Findings: The results of SEM showed that learners' WTC was significantly predicted by emotioncy and teacher immediacy. Further, reports from correlational and regression analyses revealed a significantly positive correlation, first, between teacher immediacy and learners' WTC, secondly, between emotioncy and learners' WTC. Research limitations\/implications: The main limitation of this study was that the participants were selected from one context with relatively a small sample which might restrict the generalization. Nonetheless, the present study findings might extend ancillary horizons and provided worthwhile insights into the perception of teacher immediacy and emotioncy on students' willingness to communicate.

We investigate classroom practice seeking to achieve the concurrent learning of English as a foreign language together with disciplinary knowledge of physics as a practice. Classroom life is analyzed closely in order to identify traces of effective learning through epistemic practices (Santini et al., Science &amp; Education 27:921-961, 2018; Kelly, Linder et al.\u00d6stman et al.Roberts et al.Wickman et al.Erikson et al.McKinnon (eds), Exploring the landscape of scientific literacy, Routledge, 2011) in both foreign language proficiency and discipline learning (Cunningham and Kelly, Science Education 101:486-505, 2017; Cunningham et al., Science Education 105:255-280, 2020).

The modeling of classroom activity in this research rendered visible aspects of classroom practice which were essential to understanding the progression of knowledge objectives in situ, as well as the epistemic value of an actor's move in relation to the epistemic potential of a given context.

Findings: Even within a project lasting just about three years, teachers (with no preliminary experience of lesson study) engaged in lesson design based on the combination of theoretical perspectives from TDS and RME in ways that confirm the potential of that combination to enrich and focus teachers' professional development within the framework of LS . It is not clear to what extent the intensive and continued engagement of university researchers has been or would be essential for similar and longitudinal realizations of these potentials. Practical implications: As current European frameworks seek to engage researchers and teachers in collaboration and exchange across countries, networking of major paradigms of research (like TDS and RME) and uses of them as supports for teachers' inquiry (like demonstrated in this paper) is of considerable institutional interest and potential impact on schools. Social implications: Teachers' Inquiry in Mathematics Education (TIME) is a prerequisite for the development of Inquiry Based Mathematics Education, which in turn is required in many countries across the world, with the aim of fostering critical and competent citizens. Originality\/value: This combination of (major) mathematics education theories to support and enrich LS has not previously been investigated.

In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, teachers worldwide experienced fundamental changes in their profession and their lives as a whole. Coping with such an unprecedented situation and responses to it have created new and extra stressful factors for teachers to cope with, including the difficulties created by quick transition from direct teaching to virtual and remote teaching. This study examined EFL teachers' coping strategies during the COVID-19 virtual education and their association with work engagement and teacher apprehension. A total of 296 language instructors contributed to this study by participating in a survey in January 2021. To determine what coping strategies teachers use in virtual teaching during COVID-19, the researchers adapted the Brief-COPE scale designed and validated by Carver (Int J Behav Med 4:92-100, 1997) to make it appropriate for virtual education. The survey measured 11 coping strategies divided into two broad types, approach and avoidant. For measuring work engagement, the Work and Well-being Survey (UWES) scale designed and validated by Schaufeli and Bakker (Test manual for the Utrecht work engagement scale, vol 3. Utrecht University, The Netherlands, pp. 44-52, 2003. http:\/\/www.schaufeli.com) was utilized. To assess teachers' apprehension, the research employed the Sources of Teachers' Apprehension Scale (STAS) developed by Ghanizadeh et al. (Asia-Pac Educ Res 1-14, 2020). The result demonstrated that the adapted coping strategies scale enjoys acceptable reliability and validity indices. The results estimated via structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that EFL teachers' approach coping strategies positively and significantly predicted work engagement ([beta] = 0.72, t = 10.56). Work engagement was negatively predicted by avoidant coping strategies ([beta] = - 0.29, t = - 3.36). Teacher apprehension was negatively influenced by approach coping strategies ([beta] = - 0.44, t = - 5.57) and positively by avoidant coping strategies ([beta] = 0.43, t = 5.29). The study proposes some practical recommendations for overcoming the Covid-19 related challenges which could further deliver valuable guidance for supporting future training of teachers.","subject":"COVID-19, Pandemics, Coping, Adjustment (to Environment), Language Teachers, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Educational Technology, Distance Education, Teacher Attitudes, Well Being, Teacher Behavior","source":"Educational Research for Policy and Practice","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"An Introduction to Complexity Pedagogy: Using Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy and Complexity in Performance and Literature","author":"Hicks, D. Emily","description":"&quot;An Introduction to Complexity Pedagogy: Using Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy and Complexity in Performance and Literature&quot; offers readers an introduction to the basic concepts of complexity science and how they might be applied in the teaching of composition, creative writing, performance, and literature. The book builds on Critical Theory (defined as Frankfurt Theory) and border theory, serving as a critique of neoliberalism in higher education and the teaching of critical thinking as a set of skills. Individual chapters are devoted to the following artists and writers: (1) the Choctaw people; (2) author LeAnne Howe; (3) Chicana lesbian author Gloria Anzaldua; (4) performance artist Karen Finley; and (5) the performance duo Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose. The strength of this book is that it concentrates on the teaching of interrelated topics: borders (including the border between the able\/disabled), complexity, mixed ancestry, ability\/disability, texts, and performance, using the Mexico-U.S. border as the working example of a complexity system. The work of the five aforementioned artists and authors are used to focus on political resistance within the context of decolonialism, but there are also references to mixed ancestry populations (including Redbones) and disability issues. This complexity frame of reference allows the reader to see and understand both the artists' narratives and viewpoints in the dynamic relations of shorter and longer time frames. No prior knowledge of complexity science is required and ample examples of complexity-related topics--from coral reefs to zebra stripes--are provided. The focus is on students in state universities and community college transfer students, especially first generation students and students of color, with policy implications pointing to a critique of both elite small liberal arts colleges (SLACs) and research institutions. &quot;An Introduction to Complexity Pedagogy: Using Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy and Complexity in Performance and Literature&quot; is the perfect text for assignment in a variety of classrooms, including courses in Complexity Science, Composition and Rhetoric, Performance Arts, Cultural Studies, Critical Theory, Ethnic Studies, and many others.","subject":"Critical Theory, Teaching Methods, Criticism, Neoliberalism, Writing Instruction, Literature, Higher Education, Critical Thinking, Artists, Authors, American Indians, Disabilities, Multiracial Persons, Performance, Geographic Regions, Personal Narratives, College Transfer Students, First Generation College Students, Minority Group Students, Educational Policy, Small Colleges, Liberal Arts, Selective Admission, Universities, Research Universities, Assignments, Arabs","source":"Myers Education Press","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"High School Students&apos; Out-of-School Science Participation: A Latent Class Analysis and Unique Associations with Science Aspirations and Achievement","author":"Burns, Emma C., Martin, Andrew J., Kennett, Roger, Pearson, Joel, Munro-Smith, Vera","description":"Students' out-of-school science participation has been identified as a factor that supports adaptive science outcomes. Researchers have largely investigated students' out-of-school science participation in terms of structured science activities (e.g., attending a science camp), with far less consideration of how students' involvement in unstructured out-of-school science activities (e.g., using at-home science kits) may also be associated with students' aspirations and achievement in science. Research in this area has established a conceptual framework by which activities can be categorized by the activity's level of interaction (i.e., whether receptive or active). Although this conceptual framework is useful to understand the types of unstructured activities in which students engage, this research has tended to overlook the fact that students often participate in more than one out-of-school unstructured activity. The present investigation addressed this dearth of research by examining the extent to which different typologies of student participation in out-of-school receptive and active unstructured activities existed. The study also examined if these profiles were uniquely associated with students' aspirations and achievement in science above and beyond the effects of their current level of in-school participation. The study employed a latent class analysis of N\u00a0=\u00a0996 Australian high school students (40.60% girls) from six schools serving predominately above average socioeconomic status Australian high school students. Four distinct profiles of out-of-school participation in unstructured activities were found: Optimal, Receptive, Active, and Minimal Out-of-School Participation (OSP). The Optimal OSP and Receptive OSP profiles were associated with the higher aspirations (beyond students' in-school participation), and both were significantly higher than the Active OSP and Minimal OSP profiles. Students' in-school participation was most strongly associated with students' achievement. These findings suggest that encouraging students' participation in unstructured activities, especially receptive unstructured activities, and their in-school participation may be viable avenues by which to improve students' science aspirations and achievement.","subject":"Foreign Countries, High School Students, Science Activities, Science Instruction, Student Participation, Extracurricular Activities, Academic Aspiration, Science Achievement, Nonformal Education, Home Study","source":"Journal of Research in Science Teaching","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"title":"Gamification of E-Learning in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review","author":"Khaldi, Amina, Bouzidi, Rokia, Nader, Fahima","description":"In recent years, university teaching methods have evolved and almost all higher education institutions use e-learning platforms to deliver courses and learning activities. However, these digital learning environments present significant dropout and low completion rates. This is primarily due to the\u00a0lack of student\u00a0motivation and\u00a0engagement. Gamification which can be defined as the application of game design elements in\u00a0non-game\u00a0activities has been used to address the issue of learner distraction and stimulate students' involvement in the course. However, choosing the right combination of game elements remains a challenge for gamification designers and practitioners\u00a0due to the lack of proven design approaches, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works regardless of the gamification context. Therefore, our study focused on providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of gamification in online learning in higher education that can serve as a resource for gamification practitioners when designing gamified systems. In this paper, we aimed to systematically explore the different game elements and gamification theory that have been\u00a0used in empirical studies; establish different ways in which these game elements have been combined and provide a review of the state-of-the-art of approaches proposed in the literature for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in digital higher education for this review, namely, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. We included studies that consider the definition of gamification as the application of game design elements in non-game activities, designed for online higher education. We excluded papers that use the term of gamification to refer to game-based learning, serious games, games, video games, and those that consider face-to-face learning environments. We found that PBL elements (points, badges, and leaderboards), levels, and feedback and are the most commonly used elements for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. We also observed the increasing use of deeper elements like challenges and storytelling. Furthermore, we noticed that of 39 primary studies, only nine studies were underpinned by motivational theories, and only two other\u00a0studies used theoretical gamification frameworks proposed in the literature to build their e-learning systems. Finally, our classification of gamification approaches reveals the trend\u00a0towards customization and personalization in gamification and highlights the lack of studies on content gamification compared to structural gamification.","subject":"Gamification, Electronic Learning, Higher Education, Recognition (Achievement), Feedback (Response), Story Telling, Motivation, Classification, Individualized Instruction","source":"Smart Learning Environments","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"TOOLBOX Effects on K-2 Student Growth in Social-Emotional Competence: Evidence from a Quasi-Experimental Study","author":"Shapiro, Valerie B., Lee, Juyeon, Kim, Bo-Kyung Elizabeth","description":"TOOLBOX is a school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) program to teach and reinforce 12 tools (e.g., Breathing Tool, Courage Tool) for healthy youth development. Although TOOLBOX has been broadly adopted, it remains largely untested. This quasi-experimental study aims to examine the relationship between TOOLBOX implementation and the growth of social-emotional competence (SEC) among K-2 students. First, we compare the growth trajectories of SEC between TOOLBOX and non-TOOLBOX conditions during one academic year. Then, within the TOOLBOX condition, we compare two implementation directives--TOOLBOX Standard and TOOLBOX Primer--to assess (a) the extent to which TOOLBOX was implemented and (b) the SEC growth trajectories among youth. Two district schools were given an implementation directive and materials to implement TOOLBOX Standard curriculum (full, structured lesson plans and strategies with higher dosage anticipated), and two district schools to implement TOOLBOX Primer (basic, introductory lesson plans and strategies with lower dosage anticipated). There were no dosage benchmarks available for either condition. Two additional district schools practiced as usual (non-TOOLBOX). The study sample consisted of 1766\u00a0K-2 students and their 80 classroom teachers. Student SEC was measured three times using the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment-Mini, a teacher-completed brief behavioral rating scale. Implementation dosage and quality were measured three times using teacher self-reports. Latent growth modeling and t tests were conducted. In Fall, SEC did not differ between TOOLBOX and non-TOOLBOX conditions. TOOLBOX students, however, showed a greater increase in SEC over the year. Within the TOOLBOX condition, Standard teachers incorporated the &quot;tools&quot; into academic instruction more frequently in Spring compared to Primer teachers. For most other implementation variables, no statistical difference was found between TOOLBOX implementation directives. Student SEC growth trajectories did not differ between Standard and Primer schools. Quasi-experimental evidence supports the overall benefits of TOOLBOX on K-2 students' social and emotional growth. We discuss possible reasons for non-differential outcomes between Standard and Primer implementation directives within the TOOLBOX condition (e.g., gap between implementation directives and actual implementation behaviors). The gap between implementation directives and behaviors may provide an impetus for practicing school psychologists to contribute to more robust forms of implementation leadership (e.g., remove obstacles for implementation) and offer implementation support (e.g., coaching, feedback loops).","subject":"Social Emotional Learning, Grade 1, Grade 2, Kindergarten, Young Children, Student Development","source":"Contemporary School Psychology","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Responding to Incorrect Ideas: Science Graduate Teaching Assistants&apos; Operationalization of Error Framing and Undergraduate Students&apos; Perception","author":"Wan, Tong, Doty, Constance M., Geraets, Ashley A., Saitta, Erin K. H., Chini, Jacquelyn J.","description":"Background: In college science laboratory and discussion sections, student-centered active learning strategies have been implemented to improve student learning outcomes and experiences. Research has shown that active learning activities can increase student anxiety if students fear that they could be negatively evaluated by their peers. Error framing (i.e., to frame errors as natural and beneficial to learning) is proposed in the literature as a pedagogical tool to reduce student anxiety. However, little research empirically explores how an instructor can operationalize error framing and how error framing is perceived by undergraduate students. To bridge the gap in the literature, we conducted a two-stage study that involved science graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) and undergraduate students. In stage one, we introduced cold calling (i.e., calling on non-volunteering students) and error framing to 12 chemistry and 11 physics GTAs. Cold calling can increase student participation but may increase student anxiety. Error framing has the potential to mitigate student anxiety when paired with cold calling. GTAs were then tasked to rehearse cold calling paired with error framing in a mixed-reality classroom simulator. We identified GTA statements that aligned with the definition of error framing. In stage two, we selected a few example GTA error framing statements and interviewed 13 undergraduate students about their perception of those statements. Results: In the simulator, all the GTAs rehearsed cold calling multiple times while only a few GTAs made error framing statements. A thematic analysis of GTAs' error framing statements identified ways of error indication (i.e., explicit and implicit) and framing (i.e., natural, beneficial, and positive acknowledgement). Undergraduate student interviews revealed specific framing and tone that are perceived as increasing or decreasing student comfort in participating in classroom discourse. Both undergraduate students and some GTAs expressed negative opinions toward responses that explicitly indicate student mistakes. Undergraduate students' perspectives also suggest that error framing should be implemented differently depending on whether errors have already occurred. Conclusion: Error framing is challenging for science GTAs to implement. GTAs' operationalizations of error framing in the simulator and undergraduate students' perceptions contribute to defining and operationalizing error framing for instructional practice. To increase undergraduate student comfort in science classroom discourse, GTAs can use implicit error indication. In response to students' incorrect answers, GTAs can positively frame students' specific ideas rather than discussing broadly how errors are natural or beneficial.","subject":"College Science, Science Laboratories, Student Centered Learning, Learning Strategies, Anxiety, Error Patterns, Undergraduate Students, Graduate Students, Teaching Assistants, Science Instruction, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Simulation, Classroom Communication, Questioning Techniques, Virtual Classrooms, Faculty Development","source":"International Journal of STEM Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":null},{"title":"Insights from Online Education in the Egyptian Higher Education","author":"Salman, Doaa, Soliman, Cherine","description":"Purpose: The introduction of technology in education has been a strategic objective at both the governmental and educational institutional levels long before COVID-19. However, the acceleration to e-learning caused by the pandemic disrupted the traditional classroom environment overnight forcing the entire sector at all levels, school, undergraduate and postgraduate, to shift to online learning. Regardless of readiness, the action was taken, and online instruction was implemented, improved, adjusted and enhanced during the experience. After 18\u00a0months comprising three semesters of online education amongst MBA and DBA students, the researchers decided to survey to investigate and assess the quality of the experience. The study aims to investigate the students' perception of this unique opportunity to provide an assessment of online education in higher education, achievement or failure, and based on the results, provide a roadmap for improvement. The study also addresses the uniqueness of the Egyptian higher education environment and the particularity of its student's context. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study used a quantitative descriptive survey method to find out how students felt about their online education by giving them a questionnaire and using automated numerical computation to generate data. The total number of the completed survey was 853. However, to include only those responses that were completed attentively, a speed factor was calculated for each respondent. Cases with speed factors higher than three were excluded from the sample, leading to 666 accepted responses. Data collected were analysed using correlation, regression and path analysis. Findings: Favourable satisfaction levels towards online education, and favourable perceptions towards university support, instructor-student communication and course design were found. Less favourable perceptions were found towards peer collaborations and student initiative. Research limitations\/implications: While the study proves reliability through the number of candidates participating in the survey, the rigorous measures of eliminations in the sample, the validity value of the questionnaire and the literature recommendation of the model are used here; yet it is important to point out that--further elements in the e-learning can and need to be studied, such as cultural implications, generational differences, government support reality from policies to infrastructure and management philosophy readiness in developing countries amongst other factors. Practical implications: Resources and skills are amongst the factors that were found to affect students' satisfaction with online education, directly and positively. Student initiative was found to have a moderating role in how student, instructor and institution determinants affect students' satisfaction with online education.

It is a categorization paradigm that emphasizes the cognitive levels beginning with remembering the information and progressing to more complicated levels such as producing the knowledge. Education psychologists want to assist instructors, policymakers, and curriculum creators in designing education that enables students to effectively retain, retrieve, and apply the selected content. Classifying information in a precise sequence that is durable in a person's memory can aid learners in effectively storing, retrieving, retrieving, and using facts; otherwise, the whole learning process may be impeded. Thus, it is imperative that students acquire the fundamental knowledge prior to attempting to interpret current information to develop meaningful knowledge (Darwazeh, 2017). The purpose of this research was to determine the degree to which the updated Bloom's taxonomy is included into the reading sections of EFL textbooks developed for Turkish high school students. According to the results of the research, the evaluated textbooks lacked the higher level cognitive abilities outlined in the updated Bloom's taxonomy. Consequently, based on the results, certain hypotheses have been formulated to indicate how reading sections of textbooks now being written or to be published might reference the updated Bloom's taxonomy. Methods: The objective of this research is to determine the degree to which EFL textbooks incorporate higher and lower level questions based on the updated Bloom's taxonomy. In the study, the overall reading sections of the EFL textbooks were examined. In other words, the cognitive level of the reading passages was determined using the updated Bloom's taxonomy. Consequently, the approach used in this study is descriptive content analysis in qualitative research. The updated cognitive levels of Bloom's Taxonomy were referenced in the classification of reading questions in EFL textbooks. Results: The data indicate that the reading text questions did not target higher cognitive levels. Given that remembering is associated with working memory and short-term memory, it is doubtful that it can assess long-term memory. To reinforce knowledge in the long-term memory, it is necessary to engage higher cognitive processes. It is rare that learners of a foreign language would reinforce lexical, syntactical, and contextual knowledge unless they analyze or assess the corresponding information in the texts. Measuring mainly lower levels of cognition gives them with little data. Additionally, it is crucial to apply integrated activities while reading texts. Reading and writing, or speaking and listening, are examples of integrated tasks. Thus, reading text queries were unable to assist students in producing meaningful texts. Pure and concrete inquiries have just a superficial relationship to understanding. Discussion: The revised Bloom's taxonomy is a useful and successful tool for reading classes. Therefore, EFL and ESL instructors, researchers, and textbook authors must use Bloom's higher cognitive aspects so that EFL students can reinforce texts at the lexical, syntactic, and contextual levels. Taking into account lower cognitive abilities, the most often utilized inquiry type concerned remembering, which includes definition, listing, memorization, recalling, and expressing the pertinent language and material. However, there are significant limits to memorizing dimension for language learners. This constraint may be overcome by including more cognitive elements. It is glaringly obvious that English instructors and textbook authors should include extra questions into reading texts so that foreign and second language English learners may build more productive abilities via reading text questions in line with the updated Bloom's taxonomy. Due to the relationship between Bloom's taxonomy and critical syllabus, it is possible to design a critical syllabus to obtain these competencies (Ordem, 2021). Limitations: This research is confined to the free EFL textbooks issued by the Turkish Ministry of National Education. In other words, only locally authored EFL textbooks are included in the research, as opposed to both locally and internationally published EFL textbooks. Consequently, future research should concentrate on a larger scope. Such an approach should consider the impact of locally authored textbooks and their comparison to textbooks published by international organizations, such as the British Council or Cambridge University Press. This is an important point to consider, as international publishers are likely to bring different perspectives on language learning, which may differ from that found in locally authored textbooks. Further, the research is exclusively confined to the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. Therefore, alternative cognitive categorization models should also be applied to assess course contents. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of the students' learning outcomes, and enable the researchers to evaluate course effectiveness from multiple perspectives. Moreover, the utilization of other cognitive categorization models, such as Anderson and Krathwohl's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives and SOLO Taxonomy, would help to provide a broader context of comparison to effectively evaluate the effectiveness of course. Conclusions: Revised Bloom's taxonomy provides helpful and productive stages for EFL students to be creative while reading materials. Creatively approaching a text and its questions requires assembling, creating, designing, articulating, and writing. Evaluation, which involves assessing, debating, defending, judging, choosing, supporting, valuing, and evaluating, is a further step that must be examined. Analyzing is another aspect that requires discriminating between various portions of the text, evaluating, comparing, contrasting, critiquing, differentiating, scrutinizing, and asking. These higher cognitive characteristics were not detected in the assessed reading text questions from textbooks. This lack of higher-order thinking skills presented in the text questions of the assessed textbooks suggests that students are not being adequately prepared to engage in thoughtful dialogue or comprehensive analysis when responding to texts. This is an alarming discovery as these skills are essential for students to demonstrate competency in language arts, develop effective reading strategies, and build critical thinking. This trend highlights the need for teachers to supplement reading material with activities that promote higher-order thinking, such as open-ended questions, research assignments, and group discussions. By incorporating these activities into the classroom, teachers will be able to ensure that students are exposed to the kinds of higher-order thinking that can help them to become engaged, competent readers and critical thinkers.","subject":"Taxonomy, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Reading Instruction, High School Students, Reading Comprehension, Learning Processes, Cognitive Processes, Instructional Design, Classification, Textbook Evaluation, Questioning Techniques, Reading Processes, Content Analysis, Cognitive Ability, Instructional Effectiveness, Thinking Skills, Reading Strategies, Skill Development, Critical Thinking, Foreign Countries","source":"Acta Educationis Generalis","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"Student Teachers&apos; Professional Identity Construction through Famous Education Quotes","author":"Chien, Chin-Wen","description":"Purpose: Since a teacher's identity is the result of ongoing discussion, explanation, negotiation and justification, famous education quotes were integrated into a language teacher practicum in a teacher education program in the northwest university in Taiwan. This study aims to explore the influence of discussing education quotes on 10 English as a foreign language student teachers' professional identities. This study also aims to discuss the following research questions. Design\/methodology\/approach: This case study focused on 10 student teachers' identity construction in a practicum class under one advisor. According to Merriam (1998), a case is a &quot;thing, a single entity, a unit around which there are boundaries&quot; (p. 27). The case was a practicum and the unit of analysis was participants' identity construction. Findings: First, reading and discussing famous quotes was a useful &quot;discourse&quot; and &quot;language&quot; for student teachers to construct and negotiate their identities. Second, through the integration of reading and discussing quotes, participants revealed more professional identity in knowledge and expertise, particularly in English instruction in the post-test. Research limitations\/implications: This study examined the influence of discussing educational quotes of 10 students' professional identity. However, given the nature of the study, there were some limitations. First, although the small sample size offered rich data through observation, artifacts and pre-and post-tests, it restricts our ability to generalize the results. Practical implications: This study is highly practical (i.e. learning by discussion) and strongly interactive among the participant in a professional and social context. The conceptual framework in Figure\u00a01 presents a theoretical framework supporting reading and discussing quotes as the discourse for the student teachers for their professional identity construction. Social context and relationship shape their professional identity (Izadinia, 2013). Student teachers spent much of their time with their cooperating teachers and administrators in their cooperating schools. In order to foster student teachers' professional identity construction, it is recommended that student teachers should be encouraged to read and discuss educational quotes with teachers and administrators in their cooperating schools as a mean of professional dialogue and learning. Social implications: In this study, it was argued that educational or English teaching quotes could be used as viable, effective and appropriate materials in documenting student teachers' professional identity construction out of their classroom practice in their practicum. The findings of this study derived from the nature of 10 student teachers' professional learning via discussing famous education sayings, and professional learning took place during the practicum.

Some involved only one or two single cases (e.g. Antonek et\u00a0al., 1997; Calandra et\u00a0al., 2006; Camp, 2013). Only a few studies were analyzed and explored based on theoretical frameworks (e.g. Chasteen, 2015). No explicit references were made to any theoretical frameworks in most of the studies.

This is significant, particularly at a time when traditional universities are increasingly moving into online education. To address the gaps in previous self-regulated learning and cognitive flexibility research, the current study examined the students' perceived online self-regulated learning and cognitive flexibility, and looked into the probable relationship between them. Methods: The present study used mixed-research design. The data were gathered from 115 English-major students both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative data were collected through two different scales as Online Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ) and the Cognitive Flexibility Scale. Two open-ended questions probing into both online self-regulation and coping skills of the students constituted the qualitative data. Results: The results revealed that online self-regulated learning and cognitive flexibility correlated positively although the relationship was found to be quite slight, and the students had online self-regulated learning and cognitive flexibility at relatively high level. Students also provided examples of online self-regulated learning strategies they used, and they presented probable solutions to their problems they experienced in improving their level of English. Discussion: Online self-regulated learning and cognitive flexibility, which were positively correlated, are likely to feed the language learning and improving processes since both variables could enable students to take decisions multidimensionally, without confining them to only one type of study skill. Higher level of cognitive flexibility which is associated with adapting to new situations and problem solving could help students to better manage their online learning. However, it should be noted that both self-regulation and flexibility require time and effort, and they are not products, but processes, in the journey of learning; therefore, they could be achieved through raising awareness, providing opportunities for students to self-direct their own learning and to cope with their problems, and undoubtedly instructors' role-modelling. Higher self-regulation and cognitive flexibility could turn students into autonomous and lifelong learners. Limitations: The study was conducted among undergraduate students in Turkish context. The participants were English majoring students. It could also be carried out among non-English major students because self-regulation and coping skills should be supported in every department at tertiary level. The number of participants could be increased, and students in different departments or in different years of education could be compared. Different variables such as age, gender and language proficiency levels could be included into the study to measure the influences of various elements. Conclusions: Transition into online education at tertiary level brings both advantages and disadvantages; hence, it becomes a must to promote positive aspects and to minimize negative sides. Since online education necessitates more learner autonomy, students should be trained on how to use self-regulatory strategies in language learning. Likewise, such a change in learning setting could require students to be more cognitively flexible to be able to cope with probable difficulties and to expand their thinking skills. Thus, cognitive flexibility should be instilled into the curriculum. The last but not the least, the importance of taking responsibility of learning and seeking for alternatives in the face of problems should be reminded frequently. The study aimed to provide insights and implications for all stakeholders to consider self-regulation and cognitive flexibility in designing online courses.","subject":"Metacognition, Learning Strategies, Online Courses, Majors (Students), Student Attitudes, Cognitive Ability, Undergraduate Students, Correlation, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Instructional Design, Personal Autonomy, State Universities, Measures (Individuals)","source":"Acta Educationis Generalis","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"title":"Identifying Mathematical Literacy Demands in Turkish, Singaporean and Australian Textbooks","author":"Incikabi, Semahat, Sadak, Musa, Incikabi, Lutfi","description":"Introduction: Textbook tasks are considered as tools for implementing, endorsing mathematical thinking and thereby creating chances for mathematics learning. Therefore, textbook tasks can potentially influence and structure the way students think and can serve to limit or to broaden their views of the subject matter with which they are engaged. Among the essential sources of textbook tasks include worked examples and exercises. Because these worked examples and exercises in the textbooks are mostly used by students either in the classroom or at home, they definitely affect students' conceptual understanding of mathematics and may inspire students to work individually or collaboratively with their peers. Thus, given the importance of mathematical literacy for learning and understanding of math, one should investigate the chances students can have through it. This study aims to reveal the inclusion of the mathematical literacy demands in the fifth-grade mathematics textbooks from Turkey, Singapore, and Australia. Methods: Being qualitative in nature, the current study employed a document analysis method to examine the textbooks. The cycle of mathematical literacy processes, defined in PISA framework, was used as a framework during the analysis to investigate mathematical literacy demands. Results: Findings of the analysis of mathematical literacy demand in real life problems indicated that textbooks from all three countries had provided more opportunities for the competencies of two mathematical literacy processes, formulating and employing, while a small portion of these problems requires higher level cognitive skills to interpret\/evaluate their mathematical solutions and make decisions for real life, which is the third process in the cycle; therefore, most of the real-life problems in the textbooks could not provide the chances for completing the whole mathematical literacy cycle. Moreover, textbooks from all three countries provided more chances for experiencing mathematical literacy processes in to-be-solved questions rather than worked examples. Discussion: In general, textbooks from all three countries have included a small portion of the problems relating real life. Related literature also proves evidence for lack of real-life opportunities in the mathematics textbook tasks. Moreover, textbooks from all countries had provided more opportunities for the competencies of formulating and employing while a small portion of these problems requires higher level cognitive skills to interpret\/evaluate their mathematical solutions and make decisions for real life. These results are not in accordance with the mathematics education calls voiced in national and international standards of mathematics education: Raising individuals with both mathematical thinking and reasoning skills and a useful foundation of mathematical knowledge and skills needed in all areas of life. Most of the real-life questions in the textbooks could not provide the chances for completing the whole mathematical literacy cycle. Textbooks' weaknesses in their inclusion of MLP may also cause impediments in the development of students' skills of handling the problems that they confronted in daily life. Limitations: The present study only included one textbook from each country while these textbooks were representing the authenticity of the other textbooks in these countries. Moreover, this study examined the opportunities of mathematical literacy only provided in the textbooks while the actual implications of these opportunities may differ across classrooms in these countries. Conclusions: Students' inappropriate practices with the real-life problems may cause them to not successfully solving these kinds of problems. Instead, employing more real-life problems in the classroom activities may result in higher student understanding. Moreover, examples and tasks from daily life are helpful to provide students with meaningful contexts and enable students to relate to their familiar experiences. The absence of providing necessary problem-solving opportunities in a range of different types in the textbooks may cause students to not solve specific types of problems. Moreover, textbooks should also include these problem-solving opportunities to construct students' conceptual appreciations of problem structures. Thus, one implication this study can make is that Singaporean and Australian textbook creators should include more sufficient practices of the whole MLP cycle in their problems to make sure students acquire the principal latent components of the problems.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Textbooks, Textbook Content, Mathematics Skills, Cultural Differences, Mathematics Instruction, Grade 5, Relevance (Education), Word Problems (Mathematics)","source":"Acta Educationis Generalis","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey, Singapore, Australia"},{"title":"Global Warming in the Minds of Mexican Higher Education Students: An Exploratory Study","author":"Munguia, Nora, Romero, America, Anaya-Eredias, Carlos, Perkins, Krystal M., Velazquez, Luis","description":"Purpose: The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 is at the core of many sustainability initiatives on Mexican higher education institutions (HEIs).

Participants were recruited via convenience\/snowball techniques which provided access to a diverse sample. Those who agreed to partake in the study were directed to an online platform via Google forms. Data were collected from January to April 2021. Coding and data treatment was conducted according to the developers' codebook and SPSS scripts. After running the statistical program scripts to determine the respondents' segment, a univariate descriptive analysis was performed for each item in the questionnaire to describe general properties in each variable. Subsequently, a series of correspondence analyses was conducted to examine the existence of clusters or patterns that could indicate relationships among selected questions. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that the majority of the Mexican engineering higher education students participating in the survey fell in the segment of alarmed, 47.3%, or the segment of concerned, 46.%. Furthermore, 78.6% of higher education students in the alarmed segment were extremely sure that global warming is happening. In addition, 98% believed that it is caused mostly by human activities. Furthermore, 89% stated that global warming would harm them personally significantly and 96% thought that future generations would be harmed considerably. About 78% believed that people in Mexico and the USA are currently being harmed by global warming. On the other hand, about 45% of students in the concerned group noted they were extremely sure. In addition, 96% of them thought that global warming is being produced mostly by anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, 39% said global warming will harm them personally to a great deal. However, nearly 80% noted that global warming would also hurt future generations. Although those students in the alarmed and concerned group show similar beliefs and concerns about global warming, the magnitude of concern was more significant for those in the alarmed segment. Research limitations\/implications: There are several limitations to the study. First, the online questionnaire did not allow for clarification or follow-up on behalf of the respondents. Therefore, it could be possible that respondents misunderstood some items. However, the research team took the following measures to limit confusion: (1) The questionnaire had been previously used in several studies. None of these studies reported problems related to confusion, so the research team took this fact as evidence of the acceptable reliability of the questionnaire. (2) A face-to-face pilot test was carried out with 30 university students where no problems of comprehension were reported. (3) The target population had adequate prior knowledge of climate change, so the possibility of misunderstandings was likely low. A second limitation relates to the nature of the study. Fighting to mitigate the global climate crisis is a positive social norm. Respondents may have provided answers in line with this social norm and presented themselves as more pro-environmental than they actually are. Second, because of our selection criteria, our data may overestimate the general public's &quot;worldviews&quot; on climate change. Finally, this study was carried on during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have impacted items' responses. These limitations constitute future opportunities for future research. Specifically, future research might ideally use a large-scale comprehensive study evaluating the broader Mexican public's beliefs and views about climate change. Furthermore, because our data showed that our respondents were very concerned about climate change, but did little in terms of behavioral mitigation, future research should continue to examine and explore differences in various measures of climate friendly behaviors among different segments of the population. Practical implications: This study's findings have at least twofold implications for university authorities and sustainability practitioners in their pursuit of meeting SDG 13. The first implication is related to academic life. Undoubtedly, having a high percentage of students believing in global warming and mainly that this phenomenon is by anthropogenic activities is a strong indication of their knowledge. But, indirectly, these results validate the sustainability teaching and research efforts in their HEIs, implying the commitment to sustaining and improving the quality of their sustainability-educational initiatives in all institutional areas. The second implication of our findings is related to HEIs' future commitments to address the target of SDG 13 during the present Decade of Actions. Results also lead us to reflect on the role of Mexican HEIs as agents of change, beyond offering good instruction on climate science as an agent of socialization to encourage positive mitigation and adaptation behaviors among the general population. Social implications: The social implication behind the environmental values of younger people found in this study is that a deeper understanding of these millennials' beliefs and concerns toward global warming will help Mexican policymakers implement policies in this regard and hopefully will be endorsed by a significant proportion of the Mexican population. Originality\/value: The originality of this study is the application of the Global Warming's Six Americas survey questionnaire in higher education settings. Therefore, the knowledge generated determines the quality of the article. As findings in this study revealed, there is apparently little disagreement among the Mexican engineering higher education students about the belief of the existence of global warming and this phenomenon is being caused mainly by human-related activities. Nevertheless, a minority of students still believe that global warming is caused naturally or not occurring. However, it is not possible to claim victory, as these achievements should not be considered, in any way, a guarantee that students will carry out behaviors in their daily lives that impact a reduction in global warming. Nevertheless, the study provides insights to allow university authorities to ensure that the current beliefs and concerns will not fade in the post-pandemic times. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic should be taken a pivotal era toward the goal of increasing the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.","subject":"Climate, Foreign Countries, Engineering Education, Undergraduate Students, Sustainable Development, Knowledge Level, Conservation (Environment), Student Behavior, Student Attitudes","source":"International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education","publicationdateyear":2023,"identifiersgeo":"Mexico"}]
