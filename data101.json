The major objective was to provide an electronic language learning environment that can enable learners with mother tongue deficiencies to enhance their knowledge of grammar and acquire writing skills in Runyakitara. The system currently focuses on nouns and employs natural language processing in order to generate a large base of exercise material without extensive tuning by teachers. Language learners used the system over 10 sessions and their improvements were charted. Besides this empirical evaluation, we also sought the opinions of Runyakitara experts about the system (as a judgmental evaluation). Results from the evaluation study indicate that RU_CALL has the ability to assess users' knowledge of Runyakitara and to enhance grammar and writing skills in the language. This computational resource can be utilized by other interested learners of Runyakitara, and the idea can be extended to other indigenous languages with emigrant populations who wish to maintain their language skills.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Native Language Instruction, Grammar, Language Maintenance, Nouns, Natural Language Processing, Online Courses, Writing Skills, Skill Development, Computational Linguistics, African Languages, Foreign Countries, Morphology (Languages), Language Research, Questionnaires, Pretesting, Statistical Significance","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Uganda"},{"id":"EJ1077717","title":"Applying Role-Playing Strategy to Enhance Learners' Writing and Speaking Skills in EFL Courses Using Facebook and Skype as Learning Tools: A Case Study in Taiwan","author":"Yen, Yen-Chen, Hou, Huei-Tse, Chang, Kuo En","description":"English as a foreign language (EFL) instruction faces many challenges in Asia because of many cultural and environmental factors, such as the lack of interactive speaking environments, emphasis placed on test scores, and foreign language anxiety. The purpose of this research is to conduct an EFL instructional course by integrating Facebook (asynchronous online discussion) and Skype (synchronous online discussion) as platforms through which students perform role-playing based learning activities and to observe the effects of the course on the challenges mentioned above. The study consists of 42 participants who are enrolled in an English conversation course in a business college in Taiwan. This study conducted a learning performance analysis, correlation analysis, and qualitative content analysis of the learning process. The results indicate that the learners improved their speaking and writing skills through the learning tools and role-playing activities. The content analysis also demonstrated that learners could improve their speaking and writing skills via peer-to-peer and self-correction behaviors. We also provide several recommendations for EFL educators and researchers.","subject":"Role Playing, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Content Analysis, Conversational Language Courses, Correlation, Business Schools, Foreign Countries, Asians, Second Language Instruction, Cultural Influences, Environmental Influences, Computer Mediated Communication, Synchronous Communication, Qualitative Research, Learning Processes, Writing Skills, Oral Language, Peer Relationship, Error Correction, Case Studies, College Students, Social Media, Language Tests, Pretests Posttests","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1077787","title":"Design Considerations of Help Options in Computer-Based L2 Listening Materials Informed by Participatory Design","author":"C\u00e1rdenas-Claros, M\u00f3nica Stella","description":"This paper reports on the findings of two qualitative exploratory studies that sought to investigate design features of help options in computer-based L2 listening materials.

To fill this void in the research, an investigation was conducted of the impact of method of instructional delivery on the performance of teacher candidates in a Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) program during their culminating student teaching internship. Focusing on a group of TESL interns who completed either online or F2F methodology training, a mixed methodology was used to compare student teacher outcomes on two key performance assessments and to compare university supervisor perceptions of student teacher performance. While the type of instructional setting was not found to significantly impact the teaching performance of the interns, interview data suggested that support from a cooperating teacher and prior experience working with students of diverse language and cultural backgrounds strongly influenced the teacher candidates' instructional practices.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Cooperating Teachers, Student Teachers, Mixed Methods Research, Internship Programs, Comparative Analysis, Supervisors, Online Courses, Prior Learning, Teacher Attitudes, Conventional Instruction, Cultural Differences, Cultural Background, Teaching Methods, College Faculty, Language Teachers, Meta Analysis, Teacher Education, Graduate Students, Semi Structured Interviews, Pretests Posttests","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1063476","title":"Investigating an Innovative Computer Application to Improve L2 Word Recognition from Speech","author":"Matthews, Joshua, O'Toole, John Mitchell","description":"The ability to recognise words from the aural modality is a critical aspect of successful second language (L2) listening comprehension.

This report describes the development of an innovative computer application to improve L2 word recognition from speech, and goes on to describe an exploratory study of its use by 33 English as a second language (ESL) students. The study detected significant differences between word recognition scores measured before and after participants used the application. The manner with which students engaged with the computer application in terms of word recognition, self-determined exposure to speech input (repetitions) and modified output productivity (revisions) are also described and analysed. Differences in engagement by learners with different word recognition capabilities are noted.

In this study, the language learners' output performance (the quantity of IUs was operationalized as the dependent variable) was hypothesized to be affected by task type and duration time. The findings indicate that both were significant in eliciting the amount of IUs. As a result, the contributions of this study include (a) shedding some light on the academic and educational capacity of blog-mediated telecollaboration, (b) revealing multiple factors that might affect the telecollaborative mechanism with the use of weblogs for language learning purposes, and finally (c) evaluating interactive blogging activities' educational value for complementing formal-writing training.","subject":"Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), Social Networks, Electronic Publishing, Foreign Countries, Instructional Design, Outcomes of Education, Writing (Composition), College Students, Task Analysis, Second Language Instruction, Writing Instruction, Web 2.0 Technologies, Videoconferencing, Majors (Students), Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1080783","title":"Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Scaffolding of L2 Collocations in the Context of Concordancing","author":"Rezaee, Abbas Ali, Marefat, Hamideh, Saeedakhtar, Afsaneh","description":"Collocational competence is recognized to be integral to native-like L2 performance, and concordancing can be of assistance in gaining this competence.

It also surveys the learners' attitudes towards the role of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to examine the effects of the treatments given over 10 sessions on L2 collocations in the receptive and productive tasks. Results demonstrated that the three groups of participants who received the treatment tasks in the context of concordancing under symmetrical, asymmetrical, and no-scaffolding conditions, improved their knowledge of collocations significantly both in the receptive and productive tasks compared to the control group which had no access to concordancing and did not receive scaffolding.

To date, however, there is still limited understanding of how EFL writers may make use of such tools along with dictionaries when engaging in a writing task. To better understand the question, this study investigated a class of non-English-major college students (N = 14) over a semester. Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning. This study provides empirical data that help to better understand how corpus tools contribute to EFL writing.","subject":"Dictionaries, Indexes, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computational Linguistics, Nonmajors, Writing (Composition), Phrase Structure, Recall (Psychology), Bilingualism, Monolingualism, Video Technology, Grammar, Definitions, Intuition, Writing Processes, College Students, Writing Instruction, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Observation, Foreign Countries, Questionnaires","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1080778","title":"Facilitating Metacognitive Processes of Academic Genre-Based Writing Using an Online Writing System","author":"Yeh, Hui-Chin","description":"Few studies have investigated how metacognitive processes foster the application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. This is largely due to its internal and unobservable characteristics. To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness. The system's functions overcame the limitations of observing students' metacognitive processes described in previous studies, and enabled teachers to provide follow-up instruction. Implications and recommendations are also addressed.","subject":"Metacognition, Statistical Analysis, Academic Discourse, Sampling, Questionnaires, Writing Instruction, Computer Assisted Instruction, Writing Processes, Writing Improvement, Teaching Methods, Cooperative Learning, Graduate Students, Foreign Countries, Computer Software, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, English for Academic Purposes","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1059267","title":"Blogs and the Development of Plurilingual and Intercultural Competence: Report of a Co-Actional Approach in Portuguese Foreign Language Classroom","author":"Melo-Pfeifer, S\u00edlvia","description":"Focusing on the topic of the development of the plurilingual and intercultural competence through the integration of electronic communicative practices both in foreign language classrooms and non-formal contexts, this work aims at defining and characterizing, in view of a co-actional perspective, a &quot;pedagogical blog&quot;, by considering it from three different axes: a personal and social dimension, a collaborative and co-actional dimension and the management of linguistic and cultural repertoires dimension.
