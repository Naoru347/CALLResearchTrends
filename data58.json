In the initial phase, we conducted a survey of students' experiences with and perceptions about blended\/online Asian language learning. We found a general lack of familiarity with, and moderate resistance toward, online language learning modes. With learner attitudes in mind, we developed online modules for beginning Korean and Japanese courses. In this article, we report the survey results and the process of developing these innovative blended and online modalities of content delivery, focusing on the strengths of the modules and the unforeseen development challenges. The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-\/copresence are explored.

We get our information seeing. Examination of images is free, while reading is impelled by the necessity of browsing the whole text. The image seems more appropriate than the text when trying to communicate easy and quickly. The speech calls for articulated language, expressed through a symbolic set of oral or written codes that we must master. Understanding an image requires less work and fewer skills than reading a text. This paper aims to highlight how messages are perceived and received within the educational activities, through the two types of communication, iconic and logical-linguistic. The instrument used in conducting the research was represented by a questionnaire consisting from objective and subjective items, applied to students from high schools in Oradea. Besides these questionnaires, a key role in the study was played by the knowledge gained while observing lessons held by students of the University of Oradea within their teaching placement, as well as while supervising teachers from secondary educational institutions in the process of obtaining teacher certification level 1. The obtained results prove that the majority of investigated students prefer the combination of two types of communication in teaching.","subject":"High School Students, Learning Modalities, Visual Learning, Questionnaires, Intermode Differences, Interpersonal Communication, Learning Activities, Teaching Methods, Preferences, Cognitive Style, Educational Practices, Foreign Countries","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Romania"},{"id":"EJ1121037","title":"Compulsory Book Reading at School and within Leisure","author":"Pavlovic, Slavica","description":"This paper deals with attitudes of secondary school pupils towards compulsory book reading at school, being the integral part of the subject Croat language and literature teaching subject, and its possible impact on their book (not-)reading in their leisure time.

ESL teachers intending to analyse English language subject textbooks written for secondary school students with the aim of gaining information about what bilingual secondary school students need to know in terms of language to process academic textbooks cannot avoiding deal with a dilemma. It needs to be decided which way it is most appropriate to analyse the texts in question. Handbooks of English applied linguistics are not immensely helpful with regard to this problem as they tend not to give recommendation as to which major text analytical approaches are advisable to follow in a pre-college setting. The present theoretical research aims to address this lacuna. Respectively, the purpose of this pedagogically motivated theoretical paper is to investigate two major approaches of ESP text analysis, the register and the genre analysis, in order to find the more suitable one for exploring the language use of secondary school subject texts from the point of view of an English as a second language teacher. Comparing and contrasting the merits and limitations of the two contrastive approaches allows for a better understanding of the nature of the two different perspectives of text analysis. The study examines the goals, the scope of analysis, and the achievements of the register perspective and those of the genre approach alike. The paper also investigates and reviews in detail the starkly different methods of ESP text analysis applied by the two perspectives. Discovering text analysis from a theoretical and methodological angle supports a practical aspect of English teaching, namely making an informed choice when setting out to analyse texts in English. It can be concluded from the literature that the register perspective yields more readily applicable data of text analysis for ESL teachers instructing in a pre-college environment. Besides teachers working in bilingual secondary school, the pedagogical conclusions of the study are also useful for teachers instructing in international secondary schools where the language of education is English and the alumni comprise non-native students.","subject":"English for Special Purposes, Content Analysis, Textbook Evaluation, Textbook Content, Language Usage, Secondary Education, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Language of Instruction, Discourse Analysis, Literary Genres","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1109684","title":"Introducing an M-Commerce Course into the Business Management Curriculum: Experiences and Recommendations","author":"Nandi, Santosh, Nandi, Madhavi L.","description":"Mobility has become an important extension to the business strategies of present-day organizations. Thus, organizations are increasingly seeking managers with knowledge of value chain related to mobile-oriented business activities, usually referred to as mobile commerce (m-commerce). Accordingly, business management schools are interesting in designing their curricula to respond to the need for m-commerce knowledge and, in particular, the scope of the content for an m-commerce course. The general conception of m-commerce is that it is a component of e-business or e-commerce. This paper presents the unique dimensions of m-commerce that makes it stand out as a separate course for postgraduate business management students. This paper also provides input in regard to the design and delivery of the course by drawing upon the recent teaching experience of the authors at a highly respected business school in India. The course design covers mobility-related technology elements as related to business in diverse industry segments and is expected to enable students to develop a suitable mobile strategy for a real-time business scenario. The course content was drawn primarily from research papers, industry reports, and examples of trending mobile applications. The pedagogy was a blend of lectures and classroom exercises on innovative case studies. The response of the students to the course indicated a high degree of satisfaction in regard to its relevance. The inputs provided in this paper are believed to serve as guidance to business management schools that are interested developing such a course.","subject":"Management Development, Business Administration Education, Business Schools, Teaching Experience, Foreign Countries, Telecommunications, Curriculum Design, Graduate Students, Course Descriptions, Industry, Course Content, Teaching Methods, Lecture Method, Case Studies, Student Attitudes, Handheld Devices, Information Technology","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"India"},{"id":"EJ1077753","title":"Teaching Social Media Analytics: An Assessment Based on Natural Disaster Postings","author":"Goh, Tiong T., Sun, Pei-Chen","description":"Unstructured data in social media is as part of the &quot;big data&quot; spectrum.

However, researchers have seldom used social media data to analyze social behavior and communication. In this study we aim to demonstrate an assessment structure for teaching social media analytics concepts with the goal of analyzing and interpreting social media content. We base this assessment on forum postings regarding two recent events: the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The aim of the assessment is to discover social insights. We base the assessment structure on Cooper's Analytics Framework to cover such concepts as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), data visualization, sentiments and opinions analysis, the Nearest Neighbor K-NN classification algorithm, and Information Diffusion theory.

Most database textbooks have small &quot;toy&quot; databases that are chapter objective specific, and thus do not support application over the complete domain of design, implementation and management concepts across a single database. The Northwind Traders sample database is available by Microsoft for download and use in Microsoft Access, and illustrates transactional processing for a fictitious company that imports (purchases) and exports (sells) specialty foods from around the world.

Roughly half of college students admit to plagiarizing using content found online, directly copying and pasting the work of others. Digital technology and social media have greatly changed the landscape of how knowledge is acquired and disseminated; thus, students must be explicitly taught digital literacy skills and how to correctly utilize information they find online. Computer simulations are an active, engaging, and efficient way of explicitly teaching students about plagiarism and how to avoid academic dishonesty. A number of colleges and universities provide free open source games and simulations, which can be utilized as course assignments or activities in order to explicitly teach students proper citation procedures.

Technology can also be used in ways that circumvent the educational process and create situations where it is not being used in the appropriate way. College students that use technology to gain access to unauthorized information is a form of academic dishonesty referred to as e-cheating. This can happen both inside and outside of the classroom and takes on many forms. The Internet, in particular, fuels this behavior making it easier, faster, and more convenient then in the past. In addition, electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops are commonly used across all institutions and will continue to be used for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, faculty can use traditional pedagogical methods for educating, preventing, and reporting academic dishonesty.

Today cybersecurity is introduced at the high school level, incorporated into undergraduate computer science and information systems programs, and has resulted in a variety of cybersecurity-specific graduate programs. However, is that even enough? Is cybersecurity so broad that education needs to be more specialized? Employers want graduates who can hit the ground running: not in the broad field of cybersecurity but in some very specific areas. This paper is structured as follows. First, we will provide a brief overview of the current approaches to cybersecurity education including government standards bodies such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework, the upcoming changes in the National Information Assurance (IA) Education and Training Programs (NIETP) Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designation requirements, and the Department of Labor competency model. Second, we will present a framework for curriculum changes, which we use to determine the viability of information technology\/information systems (IS\/IT) curriculum changes to our departmental educational offerings. We examine relationships with other departments and how cybersecurity is enhanced by other domain knowledge. Then we discuss the three specialties we plan to introduce in the cybersecurity graduate curriculum: cybersecurity data analysis, cyber intelligence, and health care information security and privacy.

An Empirical Study","author":"Chen, Liqiang, Keys, Anthony, Gaber, Donald","description":"It is a challenge for business students or even employees to understand business processes and enterprise software usage without involvement in real-world practices. Many business schools are using ERP software in their curriculum, aiming to expose students to real-world business practices. ERPsim is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) teaching-learning tool for business students to learn actual SAP and business processes. This study empirically examines how ERPsim enhances student learning outcomes in an IS course. The findings reveal the antecedent effects of two important IS constructs (enjoyment and cognitive appraisal) on learning behavior and learning outcomes during students' involvement with ERPsim. The study provides empirical evidence that some major IS constructs (i.e., enjoyment and cognitive appraisal of using information systems) play important roles in shaping the effectiveness of using simulation game software to learn business processes and ERP software.","subject":"Business Administration Education, Strategic Planning, Computer Software, Information Systems, Outcomes of Education, Learning Processes, Computer Simulation, Hypothesis Testing, College Students, Student Surveys, Introductory Courses, Educational Experiments, Statistical Analysis, Path Analysis, Measurement, Reliability, Validity, Program Effectiveness","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1113944","title":"Social Representations of Cybersecurity by University Students and Implications for Instructional Design","author":"Pawlowski, Suzanne D., Jung, Yoonhyuk","description":"Cybersecurity has become an essential topic in introductory information systems (IS) core courses. As an aid to course design, the exploratory research in this paper uses a social representations lens to elucidate the perceptions of cybersecurity and cybersecurity threats held by students. Analysis of qualitative survey data from 152 students at a university in the Western U.S. identified 23 concepts forming the students' collective understanding of cybersecurity. Presented in the form of a social representations map, the findings reveal student perspectives that can be used to motivate and enhance learning about cybersecurity threats and mitigation strategies. Interpretation of the map indicates that students' sensemaking about cybersecurity places the strongest emphasis on technological concepts and socio-political concerns. In contrast, potential cybersecurity threats to national critical infrastructure are only minimally represented. The survey also examined students': (a) level of concern about different cybersecurity threats; (b) perceived likelihood they will experience given computer security incidents; and (c) incidents they have already experienced. Instructors of introductory IS courses can utilize the study findings to motivate student interest by building upon topics currently evident in the representation\/frame of reference and increase student awareness and attention to cybersecurity threats that are missing. Suggested instructional design approaches, tailored to the level of awareness\/prior knowledge and concern indicated include: (1) a problem-centered approach for topics related to personal cybersecurity; (2) demonstrating relevance and utilizing case studies for topics on organizational cybersecurity; and (3) collaborative, guided discovery to raise awareness about national security\/critical infrastructure cybersecurity threats and protections.","subject":"Information Security, Information Science Education, Information Systems, Qualitative Research, Student Surveys, Student Attitudes, Learning Motivation, Introductory Courses, Undergraduate Students, Instructional Design, Teaching Methods, Consciousness Raising, National Security, Case Studies, Cooperation, Content Analysis","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1121026","title":"The Impact of Pedagogical Agent on Learners' Motivation and Academic Success","author":"Dincer, Serkan, Doganay, Ahmet","description":"Pedagogical agent is generally described as educational programs that guide, motivate learners while encouraging them during learning by providing feedback. The tasks (informative, guiding, or friend, etc.) and types (human-like, cartoon character, audio, text, etc.) of these modules can be classified based on various variables. Although computer-assisted instruction software is commonly used as a teaching material, research on modules integrated on such programs is scarce. Studies in the field have revealed that such computer-assisted instruction programs increase motivation of learners. In order to keep motivation levels high, these programs need to be adopted depending on the individual needs. Therefore, it can be beneficial to integrate software designed that can be personalized. In this respect, the present study was conducted with secondary school students to identify the impact of pedagogical agent on learners' academic success and motivation. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed. The first group received education via fixed pedagogical agent, the second group had the option to choose among several pedagogical agents, the third group received the education without pedagogical agent and finally the last group received the same education through traditional (non-computer) way. This four-week program was introduced to students via MS Excel program and the data was gathered as pre- and post-test method. The findings have revealed that interfaces impacted motivation and accordingly academic success in a positive way. As a result of the study, it is suggested that learners should be provided programs that can be personalized depending on learners' needs and preferences.","subject":"Student Motivation, Academic Achievement, Computer Assisted Instruction, Pretests Posttests, Pilot Projects, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Statistical Analysis, Secondary School Students, Grade 5, Grade 8","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
