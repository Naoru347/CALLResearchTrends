The current study explores whether the intelligibility of L2 speakers differs when assessed by native (L1) listeners versus ASR technology, and reports on the types of intelligibility issues encountered by the two groups. Twelve L1 listeners of English transcribed 48 isolated words targeting the /[near-close front unrounded vowel]-i/ and /[near-open front unrounded vowel]-[open-mid front unrounded vowel]/ contrasts and 24 short sentences that four Taiwanese intermediate learners of English had produced using Google's ASR dictation system. Overall, the results revealed lower intelligibility scores for the word task (ASR: 40.81%, L1 listeners: 38.62%) than the sentence task (ASR: 75.52%, L1 listeners: 83.88%), and highlighted strong similarities in the error types -- and their proportions -- identified by ASR and the L1 listeners. However, despite similar recognition scores, correlations indicated that the ASR recognition of the L2 speakers' oral productions mirrored the L1 listeners' judgments of intelligibility in the word and sentence tasks for only one speaker, with significant positive correlations for one additional speaker in each task. This suggests that the extent to which ASR approaches L1 listeners at recognizing accented speech may depend on individual speakers and the type of oral speech.", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Intelligibility, Automation, Speech Communication, English (Second Language), Foreign Countries", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2023, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1359073", "title": "Review of Research on Applications of Speech Recognition Technology to Assist Language Learning", "author": "Shadiev, Rustam, Liu, Jiawen", "description": "Speech recognition technology (SRT) is now widely used in education because of its potential to aid learning, particularly language learning. Nevertheless, SRT has received only limited attention in earlier review studies. The present research aimed to address this gap in the field. To this end, 26 articles published in SSCI journals between 2014 and 2020 were selected and reviewed with respect to domain and skills, technology and their application, participants and duration, measures, reported results, and advantages and disadvantages of SRT. The results showed that English received much more attention than any other language, and scholars mostly focused on facilitating pronunciation skills. Dragon Naturally Speaking and Google speech recognition were the most popular technologies, and their most frequent application was providing feedback. According to the results, college students were involved in research more than any other group, most studies were carried out for less than one month, and most scholars administered a questionnaire or pre-/posttest to collect the data. Positive results related to gains in proficiency and student perceptions of SRT were identified. The study revealed that improved affective factors and enhanced language skills were advantages, whereas a low accuracy rate and insufficiency (i.e. lack of some useful features to support learning efficiently) of SRT were disadvantages.

Recent CALL literature highlights the interest in CDL from various perspectives, but how CDL is conceptualised by the VE participants themselves is not explored. Participants of this study were 37 trainee English language teachers in the UK and Turkey who joined a 6-week VE. Their ongoing reflections on CDL were captured through reflective e-portfolio entries following each VE task. Thematic analysis revealed four components of CDL in this specific VE: (1) participants' awareness of digital affordances for &quot;self-expression,&quot; (2) semiotic and interactional means to &quot;build connections,&quot; (3) ensuring &quot;inclusiveness&quot; of all community members, and (4) implications of &quot;socio-political contexts&quot; of each participant for meaning-making and interaction. We conclude that in future pedagogical implementations of VE, facilitators can foster trainee teachers' CDL development through more closely guided and informed reflection on the four themes presented in this paper.

A total of 62 L2 learners of English were randomly assigned to one of the following viewing conditions: (1) full captions + animation, (2) full captions + static key frames, (3) partial captions + animation, and (4) partial captions + static key frames. They then completed a comprehension test and cognitive load questionnaire. The results showed that while viewing the video with reduced nonverbal visual information (static key frames), the participants had well-rounded performance in all aspects of comprehension. However, their local comprehension (extraction of details) was particularly enhanced after viewing a key-framed video with full captions. Notably, this gain in local comprehension was not as manifest after viewing animated video content with full captions. The qualitative data also revealed that although animation may provide a perceptually stimulating viewing experience, its transient feature most likely taxed the participants' attention, thus impacting their comprehension outcomes.

The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged.

Research literature has shown that such tools give second language (L2) learners opportunities for language learning, e.g. , the interaction in real time with peers and native speakers, the written mode of language, and the time available for planning and monitoring utterances. However, since the majority of the empirical work on chat and instant messaging has been conducted under experimental conditions, relatively little research has investigated how interaction in chat influences language learning opportunities under the conditions of an online academic language course where students have unequal status because of their different language background and level of L2 proficiency. This article presents an explorative study of the interaction in chat in a web-based academic language course between students with different L1s and different levels of L2. The aim is to shed light on how student interaction in an institutional context benefits the language learning environment in a manner that promotes L2 learners' attention to linguistic items in their input and output, and that allow opportunities for functional practising.

Methodology coursework, in particular, has been singled out in research as ill-suited to online instruction. Recent research, for example, involving second language (L2) teacher candidates has demonstrated that aspiring teachers who completed online methodology instruction were less confident in their abilities to teach L2 learners than their counterparts who completed the same instruction in a face-to-face (F2F) setting. To address the limitations of online instruction, while still incorporating its associated strengths, the development and implementation of hybridized methodology coursework have been proposed. Following this recommendation, the researchers developed and implemented hybridized L2 methodology courses that mirrored their pre-existing online and F2F equivalents. Using a mixed methodology, the researchers then conducted a three-way comparison of instructional delivery modes (online, F2F, hybrid) to investigate their impact on L2 teacher candidate self-efficacy. Although the results demonstrated that all three modes of instruction can be equally effective at increasing candidate confidence, they also highlighted the potential of hybridized instruction to address the limitations of online and F2F instruction, while still including their strengths. The findings also emphasized that simply viewing or participating in live demonstrations of teaching strategies in post-secondary methodology courses is not sufficient. To feel confident in their teaching abilities, teacher candidates need opportunities in their coursework to apply what they have learned in K-12 classrooms.

The present study employed a quantitative meta-analytic approach to investigate such effects by synthesizing (quasi)experimental studies that provide empirical quantitative data for effect size calculation. A literature search located 25 relevant studies for the final analysis. Each study was independently coded for learner, design and publication characteristics. The averaged effect size was estimated from the included studies. The results of the meta-analysis reveal that communication mediated by computer/technologies produced a moderate positive effect on L2 learners' oral proficiency compared to face-to-face (F2F) communication or no interaction. Furthermore, CMC has roughly similar effect on pronunciation, lexical and syntactic level of oral production; however, it might have a negative impact on fluency and accuracy. This meta-analysis also found that the effect of CMC on oral proficiency depends on several methodological factors such as task type, outcome measurement, treatment length, and assessment task. Major findings of the current meta-analysis include: (1) studies relying on elicited data are superior to those utilizing naturalistic data; (2) reading aloud seems to be the task that could elicit the best oral performance from students; (3) surprisingly, CMC appeared to be harmful for accuracy and fluency; (4) studies that employed decision-making generated the largest effect size, followed by studies that used more than one task type; (5) among the four tasks, jigsaw actually generated a negative effect on oral performance; and (6) as the most popular task employed by primary researchers, opinion-exchange studies produced the smallest effect size.

Students tend to favour clear-cut, instructivist rather than constructivist feedback, and guided self-evaluation through model solutions in online learning environments. However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress.

The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning.

The tasks (informative, guiding, or friend, etc.) and types (human-like, cartoon character, audio, text, etc.) of these modules can be classified based on various variables. Although computer-assisted instruction software is commonly used as a teaching material, research on modules integrated on such programs is scarce. Studies in the field have revealed that such computer-assisted instruction programs increase motivation of learners. In order to keep motivation levels high, these programs need to be adopted depending on the individual needs. Therefore, it can be beneficial to integrate software designed that can be personalized. In this respect, the present study was conducted with secondary school students to identify the impact of pedagogical agent on learners' academic success and motivation. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed. The first group received education via fixed pedagogical agent, the second group had the option to choose among several pedagogical agents, the third group received the education without pedagogical agent and finally the last group received the same education through traditional (non-computer) way. This four-week program was introduced to students via MS Excel program and the data was gathered as pre- and post-test method.

Analysis of qualitative survey data from 152 students at a university in the Western U.S. identified 23 concepts forming the students' collective understanding of cybersecurity. Presented in the form of a social representations map, the findings reveal student perspectives that can be used to motivate and enhance learning about cybersecurity threats and mitigation strategies. Interpretation of the map indicates that students' sensemaking about cybersecurity places the strongest emphasis on technological concepts and socio-political concerns. In contrast, potential cybersecurity threats to national critical infrastructure are only minimally represented. The survey also examined students': (a) level of concern about different cybersecurity threats; (b) perceived likelihood they will experience given computer security incidents; and (c) incidents they have already experienced. Instructors of introductory IS courses can utilize the study findings to motivate student interest by building upon topics currently evident in the representation/frame of reference and increase student awareness and attention to cybersecurity threats that are missing.

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search. In qualitative researches, newspapers are considered to be public archive and used as reference documents. The data obtained was grouped depending on the newspapers which it was taken from, on the year of publication, on where they took place, on the gender of the victims and on who the sufferers are.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Bullying, Newspapers, Higher Education, Qualitative Research, News Reporting, Violence", "source": "Practice and Theory in Systems of Education", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": "Turkey"}, {"id": "EJ1051723", "title": "Learning to Identify and Actualize Affordances in a New Tool", "author": "Haines, Karen J.", "description": "Keeping abreast of new technologies and the opportunities they offer is a challenge for inservice teachers (Blake, 2008; Egbert, Akasha, Huff, &amp; Lee, 2011; Hanson-Smith, 2006; Hubbard, 2007; Robb, 2006). An important aspect of teacher learning about the use of technology is the ability to identify the affordances of new tools and how they can support learning in the language classroom (Hampel &amp; Stickler, 2005; Kessler, 2010). This fourteen-month-long longitudinal study of the learning of two experienced foreign language teachers working together describes how their perceptions of the affordances of two computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools developed over time. Interview data collected over three semesters demonstrated how teachers' perceptions of affordance evolve through classroom practice with technology, and how such perceptions might be transferred to the use of a new tool. As well, although the two teachers used the same tools (blogs and wikis) in the same courses and, at times, with the same classes, they perceived different learning affordances in relation to the language learning processes they prioritized.

One of the essential CMC activities in foreign language education is undoubtedly telecollaboration. This is the application of online communication tools to connect classes of language learners in geographically distant locations with the aim of developing their foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative tasks and project work (O'Dowd, 2007).

In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources.

Suggestions are given for use of technology, and future research (Beatty, 2010; Levy &amp; Stockwell, 2006). One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences.

Yet studies that bring together multiple sources of data collection and examine multimodal language learning contexts are almost non-existent. In this paper, the theory of social presence is employed to explicate language learners' online multimodal communication using a case study approach. Multiple sources of data were collected, including interviews, open-ended and closed post-task questionnaires, stimulated reflection and recordings of video interactions. The main findings of the study included an innovative social presence framework developed for the analysis of online multimodal language learner interactions (Satar, 2010), which can be used in further qualitative and exploratory research. It also has potential applicability for educators to develop strategies for language learners to guide them in creating and transmitting their social presence.

Comparing and contrasting the merits and limitations of the two contrastive approaches allows for a better understanding of the nature of the two different perspectives of text analysis.

In &quot;data-driven learning,&quot; previous research has often failed to provide rigorous criteria for choosing the words or phrases suitable for correction with corpus data. By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy.

First, 100 EFL teachers completed the Teacher Technology Integration Survey developed by Vannatta and Banister (2009), to help estimate technology use in EFL classes. Then the researchers interviewed twelve teachers, comprising two EFL teacher educators with no CALL experience, four teachers with the experience of integrating technology in their EFL classes, four EFL teachers who had recently finished an online CALL teacher education program, and two EFL teachers with no CALL experience. The semi-structured interview questions were designed by the researchers, one of whom has extensive experience with CALL, and were revised based on the suggestions of a colleague with expertise in teacher education. One of the researchers conducted the interviews, each of which lasted for 30-50 minutes. The researchers used structural content analysis of the interview transcripts to find themes relevant to the research question.

Seventy-eight students with Chinese as their first language read two online passages with either Chinese (L1) or English (L2) glosses.

After reading, the students were assessed with a vocabulary test which contained a definition-supply part and a cloze part serving as both post-tests and delayed post-tests. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were utilized to analyze the score data. Significant differences were found not only among the four groups but also between the two post-tests. Overall the high proficiency groups performed better in the post-tests, but the high proficiency group who received English glosses remembered more words in the delayed post-test than the high proficiency group who received Chinese glosses.

This study explores the action research dimension of successive phases of the project from the development of appropriate training materials, data collection in language classrooms, selection of illustrative teaching episodes, and preparation for online presentation for future teacher education. It investigates the influence of research-based training on teacher development and the inclusion of participant perspectives, and explores how this kind of OER can support open practices.

The study seeks to answer two questions: (1) do learners' perceptions regarding dependence on captions match their actual reliance on captioning for listening comprehension? and (2) which learners' perceptions are most influenced by proficiency: low-intermediate, intermediate, or high-intermediate? A total of 139 students from a high school English course in northern Taiwan, all accustomed to multimedia instruction that includes full captions, completed an English language proficiency test as well as a caption reliance test (CRT), and also provided their perceived degree of reliance on captions for English listening comprehension. The results show that overall perceived reliance was significantly related to actual reliance as assessed by the CRT. However, proficiency was also found to be a mitigating factor in the relationship: while low-intermediate level learners accurately perceived their reliance, no relation was found for either intermediate or high-intermediate learners, indicating that, at these levels, some learners may not accurately judge their reliance on captioning.

Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use.

Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality.

A subset of media literacy, News Literacy focuses solely on the consumption of news items--whether it is a blurb from a friend, a blog, or a reputable news source. The News Literacy course seeks to equip news consumers with a set of tools to help them determine the reliability of incoming information. This allows them to access the news before they perpetuate it to their own social networks. To test the efficacy of certain aspects of the News Literacy course, such as verification of information disseminated through social networks, the researchers developed an interactive learning activity to enable students to experience the process via a fictionalized story.

Despite much publicized enthusiasm about new media and its role in transforming learning in ways aligned with advances and contemporary socio-cultural perspectives, limited changes have occurred. Nevertheless demand for eLearning worldwide is pushing the boundaries of education and professional activity systems. The central aim of this article is to gain a deeper understanding of how to create successful learning environments with technology-based tools. A model of scaffolded e-learning, based on current thinking and constructivist learning theory, was adopted for teaching social informatics in a university context. The focus was on evidence-based pedagogies including: (1) authentic learning by applying &quot;Pedagogy 2.0&quot; tasks and social media (2) the adoption of scaffolded pedagogy by the instructor to achieve learning outcomes. The methodology used was qualitative, based on teacher pedagogical tasks and activities designed for students in order to establish the success of the types of scaffolding offered and student perceptions of their effectiveness in promoting collaboration and learning. The research demonstrates that technological innovations which are accompanied by pedagogical scaffolding promote effective teaching of social informatics. The research concludes that while web 2.0 tools can enable engaged, self-regulated learning, students may not always be familiar with the tools or cognitive strategies to support their learning processes. Digital tools such as Twitter and blogs were found to engage students' in real-world activities to learn key concepts, and that task scaffolding was an effective pedagogical approach.", "subject": "Case Studies, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Web 2.0 Technologies, Information Science, Information Science Education, Electronic Learning, Constructivism (Learning), College Instruction, Qualitative Research, Instructional Effectiveness, Graduate Students, Undergraduate Students, Student Attitudes, Foreign Countries", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "Australia"}, {"id": "EJ1125958", "title": "Competence-Based System Self-Study System for Suggesting Study Materials Links", "author": "Nitchot, Athitaya, Gilbert, Lester, Wills, Gary B.", "description": "The article proposes a self-study system which suggests web links to learners.

The purpose of this paper is to report on a pilot project that developed a customisable education programme to support Indigenous communities in the uptake of spatial mapping technologies to protect and manage cultural heritage in Victoria, Australia. Design/methodology/approach: A training programme to support Wadawurrung capabilities in spatial mapping technologies was developed, delivered and evaluated. Concurrently, the system's database was indigenised by Wadawurrung cultural heritage workers. Types and numbers of culturally significant sites mapped using the technologies were collated. The impact of the training and technologies for students and the Wadawurrung community was gauged through participation levels and evaluations. The approach to indigenous spatial mapping projects is informed by postcolonial theories interrogating neo-colonialist cartographic practices. Findings: Indigenous communities need to be resourced in the uptake of spatial mapping technologies and if universities are going to be involved in co-developing positive learning experiences that encourage the uptake of the technologies, they must have appropriate and respectful relationships with Aboriginal communities. Training programmes need to accommodate learners with diverse educational experiences and technological wherewithal. Research limitations/implications: Findings from the training evaluations are based on a small number of participants; however, they seem to be supported by literature. Practical implications: The education model developed is customisable for any Indigenous community in Australia. Social implications: The social and political importance of spatial mapping technologies for Indigenous Australians is evident as is the need for educational providers to have appropriate and respectful relationships with Aboriginal communities to co-develop positive learning experiences that encourage the uptake of the technologies.

As evident from the literature review, most of these implementations are happening in the western countries such as USA, UK, while the level of implementation of CC in developing countries such as India is rare. Moreover, implementing CC technology in the educational sector require various decisions to be made by the managers of the Information Technology (IT) department such as selecting suitable deployment model, vendor providing cloud service, etc. in their respective university or institute. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to address one such decision. Since, different types of CC deployment are available; selecting a suitable one plays a key role, as it might have an impact on the requirements of various stakeholders such as students, teachers, administrative staff (especially the staff members in the IT department), etc. apart from affecting the overall performance of the facilities such as a laboratory. Naturally, a proper decision by analysing multiple perspectives has to be made while carrying out such strategic initiatives by any educational institute. Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology has been chosen as the research methodology to discuss and demonstrate the above decision problem that was faced in real time by one of the educational institutes in India, offering high-quality management education. The IT managers of this institute were planning to switch over to CC technology for the computer laboratory and they have to make a decision of choosing suitable alternative CC deployment models such as private cloud (PRC), public cloud (PUC), community cloud (COC), hybrid cloud (HYC), etc. by analysing and comparing them based on various factors and perspectives such as elasticity, availability, scalability, etc. Since, multiple factors are involved in making such a strategic decision, the most commonly used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model--namely, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a decision support during the decision making process. Findings: The team of decision makers, who were planning to implement CC in the case institute, found that PRC is best as they believed that it would provide adequate cost savings, apart from providing necessary security to maintain confidential information such as student's detail, grades, etc. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained are based on a single case study. Hence, they cannot be generalized for institutions across educational sector. However, the decision making situation and understanding its impact on the stakeholders of the educational institute can be common across various educational institute. Practical implications: Using a real-life case study of an educational institute, this paper presented a strategic decision making situation, which needs to be considered by the IT managers of the educational institutes when they decide to switch over to CC technology. Various criteria to be considered during the decision making process was identified from the literature review were identified and enumerated. These factors would useful for the IT managers of the different educational institute and they can suitably add or delete these decision criteria as per their requirements and situation at hand. Moreover, the algorithm of AHP, which was used as a decision support, was presented in a step-by-step manner, which should be beneficial for the practitioners to apply the same for similar decision making situations.

In order to increase students' engagement with the course content and to improve their experience with the course, the author implemented a trial of the flipped classroom model for a programming course with pair programming as the predominant in-class active learning activity. Student feedback on this pedagogy was generally very positive with many respondents considering it effective and helpful for learning. One of the biggest advantages mentioned by students is that they had the option to watch each video lecture as many times as required to be prepared for class. The author also observed that students were more engaged and empowered to take on more ownership for their learning. He recommends that other instructors consider rolling out their own trials of the flipped classroom incrementally for courses that would benefit the most from this pedagogy.", "subject": "Teaching Methods, Video Technology, Active Learning, Homework, Information Systems, Undergraduate Students, Educational Change, Learning Activities, Student Attitudes, Instructional Effectiveness, Lecture Method, Student Empowerment, Programming, Foreign Countries, Summer Programs", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "Singapore"}, {"id": "EJ1063901", "title": "Learning Computing Topics in Undergraduate Information Systems Courses: Managing Perceived Difficulty", "author": "Wall, Jeffrey D., Knapp, Janice", "description": "Learning technical computing skills is increasingly important in our technology driven society. However, learning technical skills in information systems (IS) courses can be difficult. More than 20 percent of students in some technical courses may dropout or fail. Unfortunately, little is known about students' perceptions of the difficulty of technical IS courses and how students cope with the perceived difficulty of technical content in IS courses. This paper explores how students perceive the difficulty of technical IS courses and how difficulty perceptions influence learning outcomes and perceptions. Learning technical topics may be particularly difficult for students from non-IS majors, yet this is only speculative. The extent to which non-IS majors are disadvantaged in technical IS courses is also explored. To explore these issues, this paper adopts a mixed-method approach. First, a grounded theory is developed from secondary data to explain difficulty perceptions and the successful management of those perceptions. Second, a quantitative test is conducted to validate the grounded theory.

Our formula for success comprises of inculcating the notion that IS knowledge has both a business and a technology dimension to it, treating these two dimensions as co-equals, and closely integrating the two dimensions while continuing to deliver technical education using the time-tested active learning approach. The active learning component of this course included working on a set of three software development projects focused on an e-business theme. Furthermore, given our perspective that IS knowledge consists of a business and a technology dimension, we also developed an entirely new approach to measuring learning outcomes.

Effectiveness was evaluated at the end of the semester (N = 72). Results support the efficacy of screencasts over traditional lectures for step-by-step instruction. To maximize effectiveness, students should follow along with the screencasts during class time. Moreover, professors should consider interspersing screencasts with collaborative group work. Also, professors should ensure that the screencasts have an adequate level of difficulty for the students.

The latter has shaped the classic education of a developer as a master of technology while the former nurtures an aesthetic awareness that captures nuances of stakeholder satisfaction and a more inclusive conception of system quality.

Big Data represents a paradigm shift from our prior use of traditional data assets over the past 30+ years, such as numeric and textual data, to generating and accessing petabytes and beyond of images and social media. Traditional databases stored only structured data consisting of letters and numbers, but in the era of Big Data a need arose to incorporate unstructured data as part of overall information management. The shift to Big Data started with the Internet boom of the mid to late 1990s and the &quot;rich data&quot; that could be collected through semi-structured and unstructured petabytes of behavioral, image, textual, and social media data. Social media, such a Facebook, Twitter, Wikis, Blogs, YouTube, etc., has also changed our view of data. Big Data is a relatively nascent field of study that has spawned the development of new hardware, software, and database architectures to handle the large volume of structured and unstructured data. However, the foundation for the exploration and analysis of Big Data is as old as the Information Age itself and is rooted in the field of communications.

Design/methodology/approach: The author examines the experiences of five out of the total 27 institutions involved in the UK JISC Curriculum Design and Delivery programme as they attempted to implement campus-wide changes. Findings: Common themes that emerged across all five projects were the interconnectedness of university systems, proliferation of alternative &quot;feral&quot; systems, a tendency for project remits to drift, resistance from other parts of the institution, planning imperatives, staff turnover and dependency failures. Conclusions are that cultural change underpins effective innovation and that cultural change is harder than technical innovation. Practical implications: Change is best achieved through participatory, campus-wide approaches, although a &quot;submarine&quot; strategy may be necessary to deflect opposition. Stakeholders should be kept informed about benefits to them and it is important for projects to be responsive and adaptive and to recognize that participatory approaches may be institutionally risky.

Student wiki pages were then analyzed to investigate the role of task type in the number of self and peer-corrections as well as form-related and meaning-related changes. In addition, focus-group interviews and questionnaires were conducted to find out how students would describe their overall experience with the integration of a wiki-based collaborative writing project in their foreign language learning process. The results revealed that the argumentative task promoted more peer-corrections than the informative and decision-making tasks. In addition, the informative task yielded more self-corrections than the argumentative and decision-making tasks.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to analyse the network defining the citations of 133 OER journal articles published in China. Findings: The findings illustrate that the academic circle of OER in China is small, which leads to restricted innovation. Most publications are produced by researchers working at comprehensive universities and normal universities (teachers colleges). Research limitations/implications: In these universities, a number of active OER researchers are emerging, but no OER research team can be identified from their citation networks. Currently, most OER research is still descriptive research, and only few case studies are being to gradually be conducted. Practical implications: As the Chinese OER research is still in the initial stage, more research projects in OER need to be explored to construct higher quality and more influential open content to achieve deep openness.

Results on the first set of questionnaires showed that students had low confidence, high anxiety, low perceived competence, and low WTC. The second set of results showed a marked and significant improvement, with participants feeling more confident, less anxious, more competent, and more willing to communicate.

Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction. While some may argue that the ICW cannot take the place of face-to-face interactions in a well-designed and executed ESL course, the e-learning environment offers several advantages: it is self-paced, private (thus less threatening), and provides continuous opportunities for practice and reinforcement.", "subject": "Online Courses, Web Based Instruction, Foreign Nationals, Nurses, Communicative Competence (Languages), Intercultural Communication, Workshops, Phonemes, Vowels, Intonation, Electronic Learning, Improvement Programs, Independent Study", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1042721", "title": "Environmental Factors Affecting Computer Assisted Language Learning Success: A Complex Dynamic Systems Conceptual Model", "author": "Marek, Michael W., Wu, Wen-Chi Vivian", "description": "This conceptual, interdisciplinary inquiry explores Complex Dynamic Systems as the concept relates to the internal and external environmental factors affecting computer assisted language learning (CALL).

In reality, with few exceptions, published studies of MALL implementations have not progressed much beyond pilot testing, i.e., design proposals, proof of concepts, limited experiments, class trials. Above all, what is most striking about published MALL implementation studies is the virtual lack of follow-up reports of curricular integration. In order to put MALL applications into perspective, this paper is organized into three sections. The first gives an overview of published MALL implementation studies, the second provides a comparative analysis of MALL applications, and the last addresses the issue of MALL curricular integration. On the basis of this review, the paper concludes that MALL remains marginal in terms of the number of students and courses involved, the duration of implementations, the language skills targeted, the kinds of learning activities undertaken and the methodological approach used.

However, most respective papers limit their investigation period with the early or mid-2000s. In the authors' opinion, some of the global trends which revealed themselves particularly clearly in the second half of the 2000s call for a revision of the convergence issue. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Several methodologies for measuring the global convergence/divergence trends exist in the economic literature. This paper seeks to contribute to the existing literature on unconditional \u00df-convergence of the per capita incomes at the global level. Findings: In the recent years, the gap between high-income and middle-income countries is decreasing especially rapidly. The gap between high-income and low-income countries, meanwhile, is decreasing at a much slower pace. At the same time, the gap between middle-income and low-income countries is actually widening. Indeed, in the early 1980s GDP per capita in the low-income countries was on average three times lower than in the middle-income countries, and this gap was totally overshadowed by the more than ten-time abyss between the middle-income and the high-income countries. Now, however, the GDP per capita in low-income countries lags behind the middle-income ones by more than five times, which is largely the same as the gap (rapidly contracting in the recent years) between the high-income and the middle-income countries. This clearly suggests that the configuration of the world system has experienced a very significant transformation in the recent 30 years. Research limitations/implications: The research concentrates upon the dynamics of the gap in per capita income between the high-income, the middle-income, and the low-income countries.

As business and government organizations become &quot;paperless&quot;, the system of &quot;record&quot; in these documents (including text messages, social media postings, tweets, and email messages) becomes more important. The job of &quot;records management&quot; is becoming more significant in the information systems discipline, as businesses and government agencies struggle to control and manage their electronic resources for regulatory, compliance, legal, and business analytics purposes. Records management has risen to be a separate discipline with its own certifications and job classifications. Many of the principles in the discipline were developed in the time of paper records but still apply in this electronic age, and are now considered part of the responsibilities of the information technology worker. As this is a potential large job market, it is time to consider whether electronic document management (in addition to database management) should be included in the college-level preparation of undergraduate students who will join the workplace in the time of &quot;big data&quot; and its exploitation.

Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013}, {"id": "EJ1004375", "title": "A Study of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication in Second Life--The ARCHI21 Experience", "author": "Wigham, Ciara R., Chanier, Thierry", "description": "Three-dimensional synthetic worlds introduce possibilities for nonverbal communication in computer-mediated language learning.

The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture.

Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games. Third, these two types of engagement in gaming culture were closely related to influencing language learning through repeated practices and collaborative interactions.

The study presented in this paper measures the oral communicative growth of language students, who were allocated at random to one of three research conditions: (1) the VC experimental group carried out interactions with native peers through video-web communication; (2) the SL experimental group carried out the same tasks with native peers in \"Second Life\" and (3) the control group performed the tasks face to face with classroom peers and had no opportunity to interact with native experts. Communicative growth was measured by comparing oral pre- and post-tests across conditions. Results show significant differences, the experimental groups outperforming the control group.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Video Technology, Computer Mediated Communication, Synchronous Communication, Intercultural Communication, Computer Simulation, Speech Communication, Cooperation, Pretests Posttests, Instructional Effectiveness, Foreign Countries", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1018764", "title": "Online Reading Strategies at Work: What Teachers Think and What Students Do", "author": "Huang, Hsin-Chou", "description": "This study designed and developed a web-based reading strategy training program and investigated students' use of its features and EFL teachers' and students' perceptions of the program. The recent proliferation of online reading materials has made information easily available to L2 readers; however, L2 readers' ability to deal with them requires the development of specific reading strategies. The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy. The program offers four types of reading strategy functions (Global, Problem-solving, Support, and Socio-affective) through 15 strategy buttons: Keyword, Preview, Prediction, Outline, Summary, Semantic Mapping, Pronunciation, Speed Reading, Dictionary, Translation, Grammar, Highlight, Notebook, Music Box, and My Questions. Forty college teachers and thirty-two EFL students in Taiwan were invited to use and evaluate this program. The researcher tracked students' use of the functions, and teachers and students completed a survey and written reflections that documented their perceptions of the program. Both groups gave positive feedback on the program's user-friendly interface design and the effectiveness of its strategy function keys for enhancing reading comprehension and motivating learning. They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap. The high-proficiency group's more frequent use of Global strategies echoed teachers' preference for teaching Global strategies. This connection suggests that teachers should provide more explicit training to encourage all students to use Global strategies for overall textual understanding.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Language Teachers, Second Language Learning, Teacher Attitudes, Student Attitudes, Reading Strategies, Web Based Instruction, Reading Instruction, Educational Technology, Computer Uses in Education, College Faculty, College Students, Program Effectiveness, Reading Comprehension, Teaching Methods, Student Motivation, Holistic Approach, Reading Skills, Problem Solving, Social Influences, Computer Mediated Communication, Educational Strategies", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1004373", "title": "Effects of Webcams on Multimodal Interactive Learning", "author": "Codreanu, Tatiana, Celik, Christelle Combe", "description": "This paper describes the multimodal pedagogical communication of two groups of online teachers; trainee tutors (second year students of the Master of Arts in Teaching French as a Foreign Language at the University Lumiere-Lyon 2) and experienced teachers based in different locations (France, Spain and Finland).

Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

Firstly, it seeks to record the technologies in current use by learners of a range of languages at an Australian university in 2011. Data was collected via a large-scale survey of 587 foreign language students across ten languages at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011. The data reported in two studies, one by Conole (2008) and one by Peters, Weinberg and Sarma (2008) are used as points of reference for the comparison with the present study. The findings of the current study point to the autonomy and independence of the language learners in this cohort and the re-emergence of CALL tools, both for in-class and out-of-class learning activities. According to this data set, learners appear to have become more autonomous and independent and much more able to shape and resource their personal language learning experience in a blended learning setting. The students also demonstrate a measure of sophistication in their use of online tools, such that they are able to work around known limitations and constraints. In other words, the students have a keen awareness of the affordances of the technologies they are using.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Foreign Countries, Surveys, Educational Technology, Information Technology, College Students, Comparative Analysis, Computer Assisted Instruction, Learning Activities, Blended Learning, Educational History, Educational Research, Telecommunications, Student Attitudes", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Australia"}, {"id": "EJ1004376", "title": "Evaluating a Web-Based Video Corpus through an Analysis of User Interactions", "author": "Caws, Catherine G.", "description": "As shown by several studies, successful integration of technology in language learning requires a holistic approach in order to scientifically understand what learners do when working with web-based technology (cf.

A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html]. Hence, students use the basis of their worldviews to shape and interpret their own meanings in writing. Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives.

This study takes a two-tiered approach. On the one hand, it aims to explore the current computer-related attitudes and abilities of Iranian high school language teachers and students, before the actual diffusion of computers into the education system. On the other hand, this study compares the attitudes of language teachers and students towards CALL, cultural perceptions of the role of computers in education, computer competence, and computer access. Toward this aim, a multi-section survey in the Persian language was administered to high school language teachers and students. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the results indicated that the majority of the participants have positive attitudes towards CALL and find it relevant to the cultural context of Iran. Teachers have moderate computer competence, while students have limited competence. Language teachers and students have daily access to computers mostly at home. The study further shows the difference between language teachers and students in that although teachers are presumed to be ambivalent about computer-related issues, in comparison with their students, teachers rank significantly higher on the CALL attitude and computer competence scales. From the positive CALL attitudes of both groups, it may be inferred that they will use computers in language education once computers become available, accompanied by adequate training.

This inquiry process is the foundation for high impact learning practices such as 1st-year experiences, learning communities, capstone projects, internships, and service learning that research has shown to increase student engagement and retention. The main outcome for learner-centered instruction is to engage students in the inquiry process and integrate their learning in all areas of their lives. The inquiry process and integrative learning need to become a habit of thought and connection that ignites learning and the construction of knowledge throughout a lifetime. The Lifelong ePortfolio Process is becoming a recognized method to facilitate inquiry, evidence-based reflection, and integrative learning. This process helps the student to connect learning with knowledge and develop the habit of lifelong learning.", "subject": "Inquiry, Lifelong Learning, Electronic Publishing, Portfolios (Background Materials), College Students, Reflection, Student Centered Learning, Teaching Methods, Biomedicine, Focus Groups", "source": "Journal of Educational Technology Systems", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "New York"}, {"id": "EJ1004777", "title": "Complex Educational Design: A Course Design Model Based on Complexity", "author": "Freire, Maximina Maria", "description": "Purpose: This article aims at presenting a conceptual framework which, theoretically grounded on complexity, provides the basis to conceive of online language courses that intend to respond to the needs of students and society. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is introduced by reflections on distance education and on the paradigmatic view underlying a large component of language courses in Brazil. From these considerations, it is reasoned that the complex paradigm offers a foundation to conceive a unique design concept. The complex educational design is then described in its constructs and features. To conclude, reflections and implications of this original, conceptual model are taken into account. Findings: An online language course design--although aiming at schematizing a series of learning situations and defining target teaching contents--needs to contemplate unpredictability and instability which prevent it from having a pre-established fixed design. Instead, it should be based on an open syllabus, structured according to learning situations that, suggested/selected by students, respond to their interests, and through which linguistic items will be introduced and discussed. Originality/value: This paper presents a conceptual framework which, theoretically grounded on complexity, provides the basis to conceive of online language courses that are responsive to the needs of students and society. While the complex paradigm is emerging and winning followers and complex thinkers over, we have the continuing education segment to open up trial areas and spread out the paradigmatic novelty.

Recent IS curriculum guidelines relegate software development to elective status confining design pedagogy into smaller and smaller pockets of course syllabi. Where undergraduate IS students may once have practiced modeling in analysis, design, and implementation across several courses using a variety of languages and tools, they commonly now experience modeling in two or three courses in at most a couple of paradigms.

The paper aims to introduce ONTODAPS, the Ontology-Driven Disability-Aware Personalised E-Learning System, which has the mechanism for such personalisation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews current e-learning systems that provide personalisation for students, including their strengths and weaknesses. The paper presents personalisation and its techniques and then presents ONTODAPS, which personalises learning resources and services to students. In total, three case studies are considered to show how personalisation is achieved using ONTODAPS. Findings: This paper shows that it is possible to use automated ontology-based agents intercommunicating to provide an effective personalisation for disabled students. The results reveal that ONTODAPS is flexible enough to provide enough control and freedom to drive their learning. The results also suggest that ONTODAPS has the ability to provide appropriate levels of learner control by allowing them to self-direct learning through personalising learning resources and then allowing them to choose which resources they wish to access. This thus gives them a sense of ownership and control. Research limitations/implications: This research reveals that it is possible for e-learning systems to personalise learning for users with multiple disabilities. Thus, by considering the needs of such users and consulting them in the design and development process, developers of e-learning systems can produce systems that are both accessible and usable by students with disabilities. Practical implications: The inclusion of multiple formats of learning resources and personalisation of their presentation to students means students will have increased access to such resources, with the potential of consuming and assimilating the information. This also has the potential of improving understanding and hence and improvement in results. Social implications: This research shows that ONTODAPS is a medium where disabled students can have equivalent learning experience with their non-disabled peers. This could potentially increase access to learning for disabled students and possibly help improve their results due to an increase in accessibility of learning resources and usability of the system. This system thus complies with contemporary legislation which requires \"reasonable adjustments\" or \"reasonable accommodations\" to be made to meet the needs of disabled people.

This study, which included both surveys and personal interviews of student workers and student attendees, suggests that through the use of web-based collaborative applications, social media, and a work environment that encourages exploration, the Sandbox has provided student workers with an opportunity to build skills as entrepreneurs, and changes the nature of what a computer lab can be for the students who frequent it.", "subject": "Entrepreneurship, Information Systems, Information Science Education, Case Studies, Tutoring, Computer Centers, Student Surveys, Student Attitudes, Interviews, Social Media, College Students, Departments, Information Technology, Computer Mediated Communication, Learning Experience, Skill Development", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Massachusetts"}, {"id": "EJ1121588", "title": "Re-Learning of Traditional Knowledge in Times of Modernity", "author": "Rosa, Enn", "description": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to an indigenous community that lives in the periphery of Taiwan. The Tao were confronted with modernization beginning with the Japanese colonial time and later through missionary work and Sinicization. These exogenous factors had a major influence on the Tao's traditional lifestyle and cultural habits. After democratization and due to the Tao's empowerment and efforts of multicultural education as well as interactive learning applications, a revitalization of traditional knowledge, and cultural customs became visible. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is inspired by social scientific methods that are common in anthropological research. The data collection are based on ethnographic field work that provides a unique and authentic picture of the subject. Besides participating and systematic and informal observation, qualitative forms of interviews were applied. Findings: The paper highlights the influences and dynamics of exogenous and endogenous factors on the traditional lifestyle of an indigenous community in the western Pacific. Due to global influences of modernity, the Tao's spiritual belief lost its importance and the traditional structures of the people began to change. However, the Tao were not only passive toward the transformation to a modern society, but they also contributed to the cultural revitalization on their own in terms of education and teaching management. Originality/value: The paper provides valuable insights into an indigenous community in Taiwan and their way of dealing with modernity. After periods of structural discrimination, the people contributed to their own well-being and cultural revitalization with multicultural learning. In recent times, networks with other communities in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region were established to foster the empowerment of traditional ecological knowledge and to develop new adequate teaching technologies.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Indigenous Populations, Indigenous Knowledge, Social Influences, Cultural Maintenance, Traditionalism, Ethnography, Observation, Interviews, Qualitative Research, Life Style, Beliefs, Cultural Education", "source": "Campus-Wide Information Systems", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1031014", "title": "Detecting Plagiarism in MS Access Assignments", "author": "Singh, Anil", "description": "Assurance of individual effort from students in computer-based assignments is a challenge.

The general assessment of the information security status of a company gives the students a view into what the companies have taken into practice and if they have used theoretical models to guide their work. The analysis of the status and suggestions for improvements also teach the students to scale the theory with the size and operations of the company.

The fact that dependence on smart phones contributes significantly in the students' purchase behaviour may lead to better insights that they depend on the smart phone, which causes them to feel insecure when it is not with them. Their positive experience with smart phones outweighs their negative experience, as their usage of smart phones is high. Originality/value: The research provides a unique perspective of students' dependence on smart phones, which is not much covered in the literature in the Malaysia context. The measurement produced can be used as a research tool for more exploratory and explanatory research regarding students' use of personal technologies such as smart phones and tablet PCs.

This effort has led to a fragmented landscape of competing metadata schemas, or interface mechanisms. More recently, semantic technologies were taken into account to improve interoperability. The linked data approach has emerged as the \"de facto\" standard for sharing data on the web. To this end, it is obvious that the application of linked data principles offers a large potential to solve interoperability issues in the field of TEL. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, approaches are surveyed that are aimed towards a vision of linked education, i.e. education which exploits educational web data. It particularly considers the exploitation of the wealth of already existing TEL data on the web by allowing its exposure as linked data and by taking into account automated enrichment and interlinking techniques to provide rich and well-interlinked data for the educational domain. Findings: So far web-scale integration of educational resources is not facilitated, mainly due to the lack of take-up of shared principles, datasets and schemas. However, linked data principles increasingly are recognized by the TEL community. The paper provides a structured assessment and classification of existing challenges and approaches, serving as potential guideline for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey with all the 125 scientists in the Faculty of Science of OOU was conducted between March and April, 2009. This was supplemented with interview and personal observations. Demographic data, pattern of internet use, impact of internet on academic activities and problems faced when using internet were assessed. Data analysis was by simple descriptive statistics. Findings: The use of internet use was widespread (100 per cent) among the scientists with the majority (43.6 per cent) using it every day, and mean internet use experience being 6.3 years. The majority of respondents (64.5 per cent) accessed the internet from a commercial cybercafe followed by homes (49.1 per cent). Most of the respondents (59.2 per cent) acquired internet use skills through colleagues and friends and 32.7 per cent on their own by trial and error. The respondents used internet mostly for communication, research and updating knowledge. Email was the most popular internet service, while Google, followed by Yahoo and Scholar Google, were the most used search engines. The majority of the scientists (67.3 per cent) prefer getting information from the internet, while less than one-third (30 per cent) still prefer the traditional library. More than half of the respondents (53.6 per cent) were not using library free full text online resources such as AGORA and HINARI, and most of the respondents spent 5,001 to 7,500 Naira (USD33 to 50) monthly for internet use. The scientists believed that the internet has enhanced their academic activities by generally holding very positive opinions on the contribution of internet to their job performance. The major constraints faced by the scientists in using internet were the epileptic power supply with 60.0 per cent response followed by slow internet connection/speed (57 per cent) and inadequate institutional internet facilities (49.1 per cent). The findings of the study have revealed the need for the university to improve on its internet infrastructures and effective user education among the scientists for the maximal benefit from utilization of internet.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses in depth the current status of grid electricity in Africa continent and suggested solar electricity as an alternative cost-effective method to the existing grid electricity problem in remote areas. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, health, communication, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on how solar power generation can be developed. Findings: The paper shows that in developed countries where ICT has been applied extensively, ICT offers increased opportunities for sustainable economic development and plays a critical role in rapid economic growth, productive capacity improvements, education, government, agriculture and international competitiveness enhancement. The paper has pointed out that ICT has yet to make significant impact in most African countries due to lack of reliable and adequate electricity. Solar electricity has been seen as the most cost-effective way of generating electricity, especially in remote rural areas, for ICT devices. For the widespread of solar power generation in Africa, various strategies have been identified which include training of qualified solar engineers and technicians, establishing PV markets and business modes, introduction of solar energy education in schools and universities, political leaders appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for rural communities, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs. Practical implications: The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established PV markets and business modes (especially in remote areas), lack of solar energy education in schools have to be addressed before the benefits of ICT in Africa can be seen. Other issues include African countries appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. Overhaul of existing systems needs to take place in order to provide the means to deal with some of these issues. Originality/value: Availability of reliable electrical energy remains crucial for development of ICT in rural African countries.

Using extracts from a corpus of dyadic NNS/NS task-based interactions in quasi-synchronous CMC (SCMC), this study seeks to document ways in which advanced NNS participants position themselves and are positioned by NSs. The findings show that, as a group, these orientations to participants&apos; differential language competence do not primarily occur in (other-)repair sequences but rather elsewhere in the interaction. The data suggest that they serve a range of social functions, including (re-)indexing an L2 social self, building and maintaining social solidarity and intersubjectivity with the coparticipant, and ratifying the power of the native speaker (see Kramsch, 1998).", "subject": "Synchronous Communication, Second Language Learning, Native Speakers, Computer Mediated Communication, Communicative Competence (Languages), Interpersonal Communication", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ998114", "title": "Elegant Instruction", "author": "Luterbach, Kenneth J.", "description": "This article describes a new form of instruction called elegant instruction.

Elegant instruction arouses an appreciation for exceptional insight, creativity, economy, or beauty, which, combined with perceived applicability, inspires learners and compels them to greater achievement, to apply what they have learned, and to learn more. To ensure efficiency, elegant instruction is 60 minutes at most. Preliminary research into elegant instruction is encouraging; further research continues. After introducing elegant instruction and discussing its theoretical foundations, this article discusses two examples of elegant instruction for inspiring learners to use intriguing computer techniques.

It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications: The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field.

Findings: The study findings confirm the validity of using the proposed IS model for library 2.0 adoption assessment. The users' intention to reuse is quite important, and accurately predicts the usage behaviour of library 2.0 services. The perceived net benefits had the strongest effect on users' intention to reuse library 2.0 systems than any other determinants within the model. Among the three quality-related constructs, service quality had the strongest total effect on perceived net benefits and intention to reuse. Compared to system quality, information quality had the largest effect on user satisfaction. It is thus important for librarians to consider all these factors for effective adoption of library 2.0 projects in research and academic institutions. Originality: This is the first comprehensive study focusing on the health sciences library patron's usage behaviour of library 2.0 applications in Tanzania, and reveals findings that are useful for planning and implementing library 2.0 initiatives in other institutions with similar conditions.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Academic Libraries, Information Systems, Models, Adoption (Ideas), Library Services, Technology, Undergraduate Students, Structural Equation Models, Use Studies, User Satisfaction (Information), Intention, Case Studies, Questionnaires, College Freshmen, Validity, Health Sciences", "source": "Campus-Wide Information Systems", "publicationdateyear": 2013, "identifiersgeo": "Tanzania"}, {"id": "EJ1014283", "title": "Teaching Case: IS Security Requirements Identification from Conceptual Models in Systems Analysis and Design: The Fun &amp; Fitness, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: Two open source ILSs, Koha and ABCD, were compared in-depth according to their functionalities and characteristics. A checklist was created for each module: acquisition, cataloging, serials, patron management and circulation, reports and statistics, and administration. For an online catalog module, a separate checklist with \"new generation catalog\" characteristics was created.

Students can benefit from the study of information systems security when security concepts are introduced in the context of real-world industry standards. The development of a data security standard for organizations operating within the credit card payment industry serves as an excellent example of a real-world security standard that lends itself to classroom study. The establishment and requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the associated consequences for noncompliance, represents a businesslike approach to the organizational protection of data that students will find interesting and one to which they will relate.

A hypothetical business teaching case, &quot;Blue Mountain Jams&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;), illustrates the challenge of PCI DSS mandates for small businesses. Small business is given some leeway in self-assessment under PCI DSS to document compliance after the decision is made to accept credit card payments.

Findings: The paper shows the relational tables and module functions in MyCite; highlights the value added to bibliographic data through performance reports of authors, journals, institutions, country and bibliographical control of Malaysian journals; and provides performance tables of top authors, rank list of 75 journals by yearly impact factor, and other bibliometric indices. Research limitations/implications: The paper highlight the problems in gaining access to full contents of journals, authors' adoption of variant names, and the vast variations in referencing style adopted by publishers, which may result in inaccurate counting and lost citations. Originality/value: The strength of MyCite is in its reference editor module, which is a programme that segments article references into manageable chunks that helps speed up the data preparation for citation counting. MyCite improves the availability and visibility of Malaysian journals, enriches national research content, and provides better knowledge of national research outputs funded by universities and research institutions.

However, they do not usually consider external collaborations as a strategic issue despite their benefits. The purpose of this paper consists of identifying different patterns of collaboration and internationalization of universities, with the aim of helping managers and policy makers to take decisions related to their national research policies. Design/methodology/approach: Co-authorship analysis has been used in conjunction with social network analysis to model inter-institutional collaborations as networks, extracting these collaborations from the Web of Science database. Using several structural properties of the extracted networks and applying a statistical treatment, the main profiles of collaborations and internationalization have been obtained. Findings: Obtained results distinguish three patterns of collaborations according to the intensity and scope of collaborations. The statistical treatment also provides a segmentation of universities according to their collaboration profiles. Finally, universities are represented in bi-dimensional maps using external collaborations as a measure of similarity. Research limitations/implications: Although this study is restricted to English universities, it could probably be extended at least to other countries in the European Union or even other developed countries. Practical implications: Research and institutions productivity are usually linked to the amount of received funding. The use of indicators related to internationalization of institutions can help to avoid a bias in favour of research quantity rather than quality, and towards a short-term performance rather than a long-term research capacity. Originality/value: As a difference to previous works, this paper analyses networks of collaboration from the viewpoint of institutions. More specifically, the combination of social network analysis and factor analysis is used to identify patterns of collaboration among institutions. A longitudinal study is also included to demonstrate that the obtained categorization of universities is maintained over time.

If certain variables do not fully comply with the independent hypothesis, it is not possible to conduct proper analysis, which leads to false conclusions. To solve these problems, the aim of this research is to adopt an expert opinion-driven decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and re-establish the causal relationship and the degree of interrelationship of DTPB variables. Design/methodology/approach: This research used a university library website as an individual case, and illustrated the benefits of constructing DTPB model by using DEMATEL through the opinions of 23 experts surveyed by questionnaires. Findings: According to the analysis result of constructing DTPB model by using DEMATEL, when DTPB variables were distributed within quadrants of high centrality and degree of causality, they became the key influential variables; when distributed within quadrants of low centrality and degree of causality, the variables needed urgent management. Originality/value: When traditional DTPB does not consider the direct and indirect relationships among variables, the original causal relationship of variables will be influenced, and then the original variables cannot fully demonstrate their causal relationship.

This special issue seeks to bring new approaches to the IT classroom, particularly with HIT curriculum, training, and education. Students entering the workforce or completing professional programs will have more career options with an understanding of how to leverage enabling technologies. Those in a healthcare management and leadership capacities will also benefit from this special edition as each of the articles presented address strategic level issues and the need for IT leadership in the planning and implementation of enterprise level systems, to ensure the safety, privacy and security off all patients are protected. The authors of this special issue offer interdisciplinary perspectives on key topics shaping HIT around the world. As members of academia, curriculum is at the heart of the matter and our authors offer justification and case studies on areas where academia needs to continue its growth to serve the healthcare industry.", "subject": "Health Education, Information Technology, Technological Advancement, Technological Literacy, Technology Integration, Technology Transfer, Information Science Education, Information Systems, Role of Education, Information Security, Information Networks, Educational Practices, Educational Needs, Job Skills, Higher Education", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1077591", "title": "A Job Announcement Analysis of Educational Technology Professional Positions: Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities", "author": "Kang, YoungJu, Ritzhaupt, Albert D.", "description": "The purpose of this research was to identify the competencies of an educational technologist via a job announcement analysis. Four hundred job announcements were collected from a variety of online job databases over a 5-month period.

However, such component on analytical healthcare data processing is largely missed from current healthcare information technology (HIT) or health informatics (HI) curricula. In this paper, we took an initial step to fill this gap. We investigated the current HIT educational programs, BI industry, and healthcare BI job listings, and students' perceptions of BI and how BI could be incorporated into HIT programs. The student survey results showed strong interests from students in a HIT course containing BI components or a BI course specialized in the healthcare context. Based on the student survey and investigation of BI industry and job market, as well as HIT educational programs, we developed a general curriculum framework and exemplar implementation strategies to demonstrate how BI can be incorporated into an HI or HIT program. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first of its kind. Our approach of integrating information from students, the HIT industry and other HIT programs can also be used as a model for general HIT curriculum development and improvement.", "subject": "Business, Intelligence, Information Technology, Curriculum, Student Attitudes, Industry, Student Surveys, Health Services, Costs, Risk Management, Employment Opportunities, Guidelines, Curriculum Development, Educational Improvement, Computer Science Education, Information Systems, Information Science, Interdisciplinary Approach, Undergraduate Students, Graduate Students", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1084389", "title": "Will Big Data Mean the End of Privacy?", "author": "Pence, Harry E.", "description": "Big Data is currently a hot topic in the field of technology, and many campuses are considering the addition of this topic into their undergraduate courses.

Specifically, we posited that expectations influence this relationship, and we applied Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) to determine whether a student's expectations about discussion groups or OHS impacts Student Engagement. Moreover, with EDT, we assessed whether these impacts are direct. Our results indicate that if instructors facilitate the development of expectations when students work in groups in a class, the student's level of group satisfaction in addition to engagement in the course will be positively influenced. However, the findings indicate that OHS exerts differing effects. When instructors focus on developing realistic expectations about the OHS used in class they will achieve greater satisfaction with the technology. This satisfaction with the technology will then lead to student engagement in the course.

The research aims to elaborate the methods that help to compare of the data concerning physical activity both built-in an accelerometer in Cardiac Resychrinisation Therapy (CRT) devices and data obtained from an external Actigraph GT3XE-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor. 5 persons participated in the pilot study (n = 5); mean age: 57 \u00b1 13.37; BMI: 90.6 \u00b1 7.63. The Actigraph data from CRT device were examined in a 6-day-interval, between February 28 and March 5, 2014. The investigation started conducting a 6-minute walking test and continued with the measurement of daily physical activity. For data analysis descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used. It is clear from the data obtained from Actigraph that the MET values (mean: 1.17 \u00b1 0.096) of the patients in the sample were extremely low due to their disease. However, some patients with higher physical activity than average (1.26; 1.28) seemed to be noteworthy, but they showed lower performance than healthy people. The physical activity of the patients during the 6-minute walking test corresponded to 1.9-2.48 MET. The physical activity of patients was found typically in the &quot;light or moderate range&quot; classifying the physical activity by Actigraph. Data from Actigraph are accurate and detailed making the physical activity of the patients measurable and appreciable. The results of the 6-minute walking test were in the category from moderate to very vigorous for individualized moderate physical performance based on Actigraph. It indicates the individual performance differences among patients. However, the daily physical performance is even lower than that of the 6-minute walking. We can conclude from the data related to the percentage of the average activity in CRT system to the average energy consumption and the improvement in the patients' physical condition. Due to the limitations of the sampling frequency the different time intervals cannot be isolated in the different intensity ranges. Therefore, the percentage of the data of physical activity provided by the device may have a limited use.", "subject": "Physical Activities, Patients, Heart Disorders, Equipment, Physical Activity Level, Regression (Statistics), Quality of Life, Measurement, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Practice and Theory in Systems of Education", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1137386", "title": "A Basic Set of Criteria for Evaluation of Teaching Case Studies: Students' Perspective", "author": "Havelka, Douglas, Neal, Catherine S.", "description": "A study was performed to identify and evaluate characteristics, properties, and attributes of teaching cases that provide value to students.

For most universities, general education is the groundwork for the student's university experience. These courses span multiple disciplines and allow students to experience a wide range of topics on their path to graduation. Programming classes, e.g., Introduction to Programming, have not typically been an option as part of a general education course sequence at most universities. This study found that, only half of universities offer any kind of programming course in the General Education (GenEd) Program. The data also show that only two-thirds of institutions offer a computing class of any kind as a general education option. Institutions with ABET accredited Information Systems (IS) programs are significantly lower in both of these categories. This paper demonstrates the reasoning and process for including a programming class as an option in a GenEd Program, thereby showing how a programming class can be used to satisfy the requirements of a general education course. This results in two significant advantages to the computing department and university since the departments expand their reach to many more students, with a potential of increasing the number of majors or minors within the department; and non-computing majors have the opportunity to take courses that have not traditionally been offered in the GenEd Program. The latter results in students receiving a more comprehensive education and exposure to skills in high demand.", "subject": "Programming, Programming Languages, General Education, Required Courses, College Students, Introductory Courses, Computer Science Education, Majors (Students), Nonmajors, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1137326", "title": "Business Analytics in Practice and in Education: A Competency-Based Perspective", "author": "Mamonov, Stanislav, Misra, Ram, Jain, Rashmi", "description": "Business analytics is a fast-growing area in practice.

Overweight definitely has an effect on motion: some people are not involved in certain activities as it is impossible for them because of their weight problem. Thus, even more health problems are generated because of the overweight. The first question arising in discussing the actuality of this issue is what effect the applied therapy (massage, therapeutic exercises, electrotherapy and balneotherapy) has on the knee and hip joints of patients with weight problems hospitalised in our Institute for a 3-week complex therapy. Based on my prior hypothesis, positive changes are detected in a minimum percentage in the condition of overweight or obese patients. My hypothesis was that the range of flexion and extension of the hip and knee joints would improve compared to other movements. Based on the results of the studied population (n = 30), my hypothesis seems to be proven. After the 3-week complex therapy of obese patients, positive changes were found in the prearranged assessments and tests, thereby improving the general health, life-style, life quality and mental status of the patients.

One of the most numerous cultural groups that have settled in the southern Spain is from Romania. Coexistence, especially in schools, has made us become interested in knowing the eating habits at breakfast of Romanian and Spanish populations. Numerous studies show that the food intake at breakfast, mostly made before leaving home, has an incidence on the physic wellbeing of adolescent throughout the day. The processes of acculturation are also inseparable from the eating habits, health and life, that maintain the migrant teenagers. Breakfast is analyzed as one of the habits more associated with diet quality; paradoxically, one of the findings of our study, many adolescents do not take a proper breakfast every day. Objectives: The study analyzes the characteristics and the main cultural and gender differences in the implementation of breakfast: its maintenance or omission in young autochthonous and immigrants of Romanian origin in the southeast Spanish schools. Design. This is a cross-sectional study with a cluster sampling in two Primary schools and seven Secondary schools. The instrument applied was an adaptation of the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. Sample. It has been formed by 1472 students between 11 and 18 years old; nationality: 1315 were Spanish and 157 were Romanians. Data analysis. Descriptive and differential analyses using the chi-square and U of Mann-Whitney statistics. Results: In the study we identified 1.2% of Spaniards and 3.3% of Romanians who either skip breakfast or do not eat foods throughout the morning. The main breakfast foods of the Spanish students are dairy, bread and cereals, cookies, juice and olive oil; for the Romanian students the basic foods at breakfast are cereals, dairy products, juices, biscuits and jams. We have found significant differences between the two compared cultural groups. We also found significant differences between the food eaten by men of the two cultural groups (Spanish and Romanian) and by the food eaten by women (Spanish and Romanian) in the breakfast food. Conclusions: The results show the need to further promote and implement educational programs that encourage students to make breakfast before leaving home. Also, it is necessary, they take care of the intake of the right foods to start the day and contemplate this habit from a transcultural and gender approach.

The results show that the graduated approach to CF is effective in helping learners to self-identify and self-correct a number of grammatical issues, although an onsite tutor provides necessary remedies when the ICALL system occasionally fails to do its part. Implications for CF research, particularly on the notion of individualized feedback, are also discussed.", "subject": "Error Correction, Feedback (Response), Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Grammar, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Instructional Effectiveness, Student Attitudes, Instructional Design", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1151015", "title": "A Framework for Learner Agency in Online Spoken Interaction Tasks", "author": "Knight, Janine, Barbera, Elena, Appel, Christine", "description": "Learner agency, the capability of individual human beings to make choices and act on these choices in a way that makes a difference in their lives (Martin, 2004), is instrumental in second language learning because attainment is only arrived at by learner choice (Pavlenko &amp; Lantolf, 2000). If attainment is understood as learner engagement in synchronous, collaborative, spoken interaction which is thought to lead to gains in second language acquisition (SLA), then design considerations that harness learners' agency towards that end is important. This study explores the relationship between learner agency and two different task types, namely an information-gap task and an opinion-sharing task in two peer-to-peer synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) spoken interaction events. Students' choices and how students act on these choices during tasks are analysed using a discourse analysis approach. Audio recordings of four dyads as cases were examined using three analytical dimensions: language functions of verbal interaction, cognitive processing and social processing. The results show that most learners used their agency to reconfigure the tasks from spontaneous to planned interaction, with some choices and actions relating to technology impacting detrimentally on interaction time in the target language. The different tasks were found to filter and channel different types of agency that learners could exercise, namely representational, organisational, and strategic agency as speech acts, and directional agency as a physical act. These types consisted of different natures and purposes and are presented as a framework. The information-gap task supported strategic agency and an opinion-sharing task supported personalisation and identity construction or representational agency.", "subject": "Guidelines, Oral Language, Discourse Analysis, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Speech Acts, Audio Equipment, Self Concept, Cognitive Processes, Social Cognition, Task Analysis", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1151245", "title": "Foreign Language Anxiety Levels in Second Life Oral Interaction", "author": "Melchor-Couto, Sabela", "description": "Virtual worlds have been described as low anxiety environments (Dickey, 2005), where students may feel &quot;shielded&quot; behind their avatars (Rosell-Aguilar, 2005: 432).

Unlike conventional full captioning, which provides the full text and allows comprehension of the material merely by reading, PSC promotes listening to the speech by presenting a selected subset of words, where each word is synched to its corresponding speech signal. In this method, word-level synchronization is realized by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, dedicated to the desired corpora. This feature allows the learners to become familiar with the correspondences between words and their utterances. Partialization is done by automatically selecting words or phrases likely to hinder listening comprehension. In this work we presume that the incidence of infrequent or specific words and fast delivery of speech are major barriers to listening comprehension. The word selection criteria are thus based on three factors: speech rate, word frequency and specificity. The thresholds for these features are adjusted to the proficiency level of the learners. The selected words are presented to aid listening comprehension while the remaining words are masked in order to keep learners listening to the audio. PSC was evaluated against no-captioning and full-captioning conditions using TED videos. The results indicate that PSC leads to the same level of comprehension as the full-captioning method while presenting less than 30% of the transcript.

A real online dictionary and its paper-based counterpart composed of printouts of screen displays were used in the experiment in which the meaning of English nouns and phrases was explained, and collocations were completed with missing prepositions.

Thirty-one adult learners of Dutch practiced with this system in one of two conditions: the no-feedback condition (NOCF) and the feedback condition (CF) which provided immediate CF through ASR. Despite concerns that CF can elicit negative affective reactions and although practice with feedback forced learners to reformulate more often, CF did not appear to have a negative impact. Our analysis finds no significant differences between the NOCF and CF groups. A significant correlation between practice performance and self-efficacy was found in the CF only.

However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students' written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher's feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, and at the same time does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.

In this study, we designed a Chinese radical learning game (CRLG), which adopted a drill and practice mode, for SSAHLC to practice recognizing Chinese radicals. To facilitate Chinese writing, non-native learners need to use aspects of the radical knowledge as cues to encode characters, from which the contents of the game were built up for SSAHLC to master the Chinese written forms by playing the CRLG with gesture-based interactions. In addition, the game was used to explore the students' intrinsic motivation relevant to online learning self-efficacy, as well as the experience of flow, to predict the degree of learning progress. Data were collected from 78 SSAHLC participating in the study, and 73 valid questionnaires were returned. After applying confirmatory factor analysis as well as structural equation modeling to the valid data, it was found that four constructs, namely intrinsic motivation, online learning self-efficacy, flow experience, and learning progress, were all positively correlated. Our results indicated that intrinsic motivation of Chinese learning predicted online learning self-efficacy, and that flow experience was relevant to the students' learning progress.

Additionally, the study investigates the relationship between the learners' level of engagement and their pronunciation improvement, as well as the learners' reactions towards the approach adopted and the way they use social networking sites (SNSs). The study follows a quantitative design, with pre- and post-tests aimed at measuring the learners' pronunciation before and after training, a delayed post-test aimed at measuring whether gains were maintained over time, and two questionnaires that gathered demographic data from participants, their patterns of SNS usage as well as their perceptions towards the approach adopted.

The approach consisted in sending learners a daily tweet with concise explicit explanations about the target aspects and a link to a video/audio file illustrating the pronunciation of the target word in an authentic context. The results show that the instruction fostered significant improvements in the learners' pronunciation of the target features and that improvements were maintained over time.

Effective feedback fosters development, gives guidance, opens windows and new opportunities. In addition, the descriptive nature of feedback has a lot more potentials and positive effect on the teacher-student relationship than traditional assessment. In addition, giving and receiving feedback can be considered the starting point of reflection. Only by having looked into 'the mirror' first can one face reality, review and analyse an experience and learn from it. As a result, teaching effective feedback skills through experiential learning is a very important element in reflective teacher education. Taking all the above into consideration, a lot of emphasis is put on teaching effective feedback skills at our Centre for Teacher Education of K\u00e1roli G\u00e1sp\u00e1r University.

These products have helped universities migrate from in-house legacy software platforms to current generation products. This paper explores the Google and Microsoft cloud service offerings for educational institutions, and compares the implementation experiences of six Canadian universities. However, although acquisition costs are minimal or non-existent, members of the academic community including faculty and students are often reluctant to entrust all of their emails, documents and calendar schedules to a complex, global, for-profit third party.

With the current propensity to focus research in digital game-based language learning on vernacular games, or commercially available games that are designed with entertainment in mind, it is vital to focus on the extramural setting in which these games are designed to be played, while still being subject to rigorous and empirical analysis. This article examines the extramural gameplay and language-learning trajectories of four university German-language learners as they play World of Warcraft with native German speakers. Positioning learners' experiences within a complex adaptive systems framework (Larsen-Freeman &amp; Cameron, 2008; de Bot &amp; Larsen-Freeman, 2011), the change that each learner undergoes while playing the game over the course of four months is explored in detail. Understanding the game environment as an affinity space (Gee, 2005) helps to substantiate how a game, independent of instructor guidance or classroom intervention, can still promote SLD amongst language learners of varying experiences and proficiencies. The results of this study suggest that numerous factors influence the success of a language learner's extramural gameplay experience, but that these factors must be analyzed in conjunction with the emergent internal and external resources of the complex adaptive system as language learners play and interact with other players in a context removed from the traditional classroom.", "subject": "Computer Games, Simulated Environment, Second Language Learning, Teaching Methods, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, German, College Students, Native Speakers, Program Effectiveness, Foreign Countries, Questionnaires", "source": "CALICO Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": "Canada"}, {"id": "EJ1143350", "title": "Researching Learner Self-Efficacy and Online Participation through Speech Functions: An Exploratory Study", "author": "S\u00e1nchez-Castro, Olga, Strambi, Antonella", "description": "This study explores the potential contribution of Eggins and Slade's (2004) Speech Functions as tools for describing learners' participation patterns in Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC).

We introduce key research examples to illustrate this potential and discuss the implications of integrating the tools for L2 collaborative writing research and pedagogy.", "subject": "Collaborative Writing, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Writing Processes, Computer Software, Social Media, Computer Mediated Communication, Networks, Research Methodology, Editing, Computational Linguistics, Writing Research, Recall (Psychology), Teaching Methods, Student Attitudes", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1142269", "title": "Digital-Gaming Trajectories and Second Language Development", "author": "Scholz, Kyle W., Schulze, Mathias", "description": "Recent research in digital game-based language learning has been encouraging, yet it would benefit from research methods that focus on the gaming processes and second-language development (Larsen-Freeman, 2015) rather than learner/player reflection or individuals' beliefs about the validity of gameplay. This has proven challenging as research methods which provide insight into the gameplay experiences and its many factors are needed. Having the gameplay experience occur extramurally is desirable, but makes the direct observation of the learners' activities by a researcher difficult. For this reason, we suggest approaching digital game-based language learning through complex adaptive systems research (Larsen-Freeman &amp; Cameron, 2008a) and employing D\u00f6rnyei's (2014) retrodictive qualitative modeling to capture the complex synchronic and diachronic variability of the learners and their individual nonlinear gaming trajectories with requisite data density and over a considerable period of time. This article draws on a study examining language learners playing the online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; over four months.

For researchers interested in exploring learner interactions in complex technology-supported learning environments, new challenges inevitably emerge. This article looks at the challenges of transcribing and representing multimodal data (visual, oral, and textual) when engaging in computer-assisted language learning research.

Curriculum evolution is driven by several factors, such as changes in technologies, industry shifts to meet customer needs, and perceived student deficiencies. One outcome of such factors has been a change in the entry point into the IS major due to the perception that IS majors need a different method of entry from other computing majors [e.g., Computer Science (CS)]. The current entry point for many IS majors is a programming course, often taken by a variety of majors. This paper addresses the question: is there a difference in performance in this initial programming course for students of different majors? More precisely, does major differentiate performance in the first programming course, such as CS1? The data clearly show this is not the case when there is a level playing field. The paper demonstrates that non-computing majors perform as well as computing majors given equal preparation. It is a misconception that changes to the IS curriculum are necessary when based on the belief that IS majors, as compared to other computing majors, need a different entry point.

Players learned to take skilled linguistic action as they coordinated recurrent WoW gameplay activities (questing, planning next moves, traveling, learning a skill, etc.). Frequent activities matched Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) speaking proficiency descriptors, used widely in L2 teaching and learning (L2TL), providing evidence that players engaged in the types of communicative activities interaction-oriented classroom approaches develop. However, in the WoW context, interactions were not planned, but emerged as players dynamically directed the course of play. Furthermore, modalities of avatar-embodiment and conversing over Skype allowed players to flexibly integrate language and actions to co-act toward game goals, discuss non-game topics during play, or demonstrate comprehension with avatar actions alone, an affordance for less verbal players.

Instruction on L2 lexical items (e.g., concordances, polywords, or formulaic sequences) was mainly given to the experimental group using LexisBOARD, which was designed to be user-friendly and attuned to learners' communicative and curricular needs. LexisBOARD offered further practice or feedback affordances through engaging students in lexical exercises (with word partnerships and collocations) for each unit and several quizzes for self-assessment. The control group was only taught using their mainstream EFL textbooks focusing on grammatical rules, discrete vocabulary items with fixed meanings, and reading texts, without any use of corpus-based activities. The results of the groups' vocabulary test scores indicate that the lexis group significantly outperformed the control group, pointing to the superiority of practicing and learning L2 vocabulary when lexical items are seen in larger, more holistic ways and, especially, when engaging and experimenting with lexis is scaffolded through computer affordances.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Computer Assisted Instruction, Vocabulary Development, Pretests Posttests, Quasiexperimental Design, Computer Software, Cohort Analysis, Junior High School Students, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Teaching Methods, Conventional Instruction, Comparative Analysis, Language Tests, Scores, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Feedback (Response), Educational Benefits", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Iran"}, {"id": "EJ1108783", "title": "Multimodal Research: Addressing the Complexity of Multimodal Environments and the Challenges for CALL", "author": "Tan, Sabine, O'Halloran, Kay L., Wignell, Peter", "description": "Multimodality, the study of the interaction of language with other semiotic resources such as images and sound resources, has significant implications for computer assisted language learning (CALL) with regards to understanding the impact of digital environments on language teaching and learning.

Scholars in computer-mediated second language (L2) learning have called for research to fill in this gap by reflecting critically on task design and the subsequent implementation process (Fuchs, Hauck &amp; M\u00fcller-Hartmann, 2012; Hampel, 2010; Hampel &amp; Hauck, 2006; Hampel &amp; Plaines, 2013; Hauck, 2010), instead of considering a task an &quot;unproblematic fait accompli&quot; (O'Dowd &amp; Ware, 2009: 174). In response to this charge, the present case study provides a critical analysis of tasks carried out in a first-year German language course built around the weekly TV-series, &quot;Rosenheim-Cops&quot; (ZDF). These tasks drew from research on multimodality (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001; Norris &amp; Maier, 2014) providing a framework for understanding how multiple semiotic systems work together to create meaning.

The results suggest that the tasks encouraged semiotic awareness, helped activate referential knowledge useful for accessing multimodal resources, and elicited a positive response to authentic L2 use in context.

This study examined two types of tasks: a conceptual task, which tested students' competence to draw a generalizable conclusion through a meaning-making process of corpus consultation; and a procedural task, which asked students to complete problem-solving activities strategically through corpus analysis. Two groups of three students were given the same tasks of corpus consultation but asked to complete the tasks either collaboratively or individually. The students' verbal and nonverbal behaviors during the task completion, pre-and post-interviews, and the instructor's observation notes were the main sources of data for analysis. The results of this study showed that collaboration has significantly different effects depending on the task types of corpus consultation. The collaborative group (CG) outperformed the individual group (IG) in the conceptual corpus consultation task, but the procedural task was more efficiently completed by the IG than the CG. The underperformance of the CG in the procedural task seemed to be partly attributable to the role of established intersubjectivity and the power inequality in the CG.

The study employed a pretest-posttest design with intact third- and fourth-semester classes for German as a foreign language at a US university.

The results show that, whereas the DDL method and the traditional method were both effective and resulted in lexical and grammatical gains, DDL was more effective for teaching new collocations.

This study examines the meaning-making potential of the webcam in pedagogical interactions from a semiotic perspective by exploring how trainee teachers use the affordances of the webcam to produce non-verbal cues that may be useful for mutual comprehension. The research context is a telecollaborative project where trainee teachers of French as a foreign language (FFL) met for online sessions in French with undergraduate Business students at an Irish university. Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, screen shot data, and students' post-course interviews, it was found, firstly, that while a head and shoulders framing shot was favoured by the trainee teachers, there does not appear to be an optimal framing choice for desktop videoconferencing among the three framing types identified. Secondly, there was a loss between the number of gestures performed by the trainee teachers and those that were visible for the students. Thirdly, when trainee teachers were able to coordinate the audio and kinesic modalities, communicative gestures that were framed, and held long enough to be perceived by the learners, were more likely to be valuable for mutual comprehension.

Learners' reasons for preferring teacher-fronted classes, blended learning, immersion or technology-mediated settings yield useful information on how students perceive the strengths and weaknesses of interaction/engagement with material (i.e. technological) as well as social (i.e. human) resources, and how the roles of teachers/classes can be conceptualised today.

Findings indicate that though the cohort routinely use a wide range of technology tools in their everyday lives and show awareness of the potential of ICT for language learning, a number of barriers exist based on learner beliefs/conceptions and learning aims. Thus the notion that enhancement of communicative competence is intrinsically tied to personal interaction with native speakers means that the potential of communication technologies such as Skype is not fully appreciated.

There are, however, very few Chinese collocation tools available for learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL), despite the increasing numbers of CFL learners within the past several years. To help CFL students and teachers efficiently search for proper collocates, this paper introduces a new web-based collocation retrieval tool, ICE (Intelligent Collocation Engine), which is based on a large part-of-speech-tagged Chinese news corpus. To determine if the new tool can facilitate the searching of collocations, this tool was tested by a group of CFL students to find proper collocates in a translation task. The results showed that the students who used the ICE tool could successfully found many proper Chinese collocates for a given noun. In addition, 12 in-service CFL teachers were also invited to evaluate the effectiveness of this collocation tool. These teachers indicated that they could find proper Chinese collocates easily with the help of ICE. The teachers also commented that they might use the collocation retrieval tool to prepare their teaching materials. Both findings of the experiment as well as the survey suggest that the new collocation retrieval tool can facilitate Chinese collocation teaching and learning, but the content and functions of this tool can be further enhanced. The findings of this study can be useful for language teachers, researchers, and developers of corpus-based learning tools.", "subject": "Chinese, Phrase Structure, Second Language Learning, Computational Linguistics, Translation, Task Analysis, Second Language Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness, Instructional Materials, Language Teachers, Researchers, Student Attitudes, Likert Scales, Student Surveys, Feedback (Response), Statistical Analysis, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Pretests Posttests", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1084734", "title": "Usability of English Note-Taking Applications in a Foreign Language Learning Context", "author": "Roy, Debopriyo, Brine, John, Murasawa, Fuyuki", "description": "The act of note-taking offloads cognitive pressure and note-taking applications could be used as an important tool for foreign language acquisition. Its use, importance, and efficacy in a foreign language learning context could be justifiably debated. However, existing computer-assisted language learning literature is almost silent on the topic. This article reports on a controlled experiment introducing usability of note-taking applications (namely, Evernote, Memonic, SpringPad, Ubernote, and Keeppy) in English as foreign language (EFL) learning context. For pilot testing, 25 students had to complete five scenarios (text editing, entering persuasive content, sharing content, searching, and organizing) using Twitter as a tool similar to note-taking applications. Results suggest that the majority were comfortable with the tasks, although they could not complete all the tasks in the stipulated time, and certain tasks and features in Twitter caused difficulty for some students. The actual testing involved the 10 best candidates (based on their performance, when using Twitter) completing tasks (five scenarios similar to pilot analysis) with any two assigned note-taking applications, from a set of five. Participants were observed, video-recorded, and interviewed concurrently and retrospectively. They also completed perception-based questionnaires on the usability of the software. Data suggested that participants were comfortable opening accounts, typing in text, with general navigation, choosing photos, etc. A few features, such as web clipping and file uploading, caused problems for some participants. Most participants reported having no prior experience with any note-taking applications and that resulted in longer task completion time and errors.

On the one hand, students expected teachers to play a greater role in supporting their autonomous learning with technology by recommending a variety of technological resources and sharing metacognitive and cognitive strategies for effective use of the resources. On the other hand, teachers expected to play a minimal role due to their overestimation of students' capacities and their concern over their limited abilities to provide such support.

In this paper, I investigate the effects of two help options in a multimedia listening environment (annotated captioned animation versus annotated transcript animation) on L2 vocabulary acquisition. Thirty-four Arab learners of English as a foreign language watched and listened to an animated story under any one of the following conditions: (1) annotations + captions + animation (ACA) and (2) annotations + transcripts+ animation (ATA). After viewing the story, the participants received a vocabulary posttest (i.e., L2 spelling) and posttest of translating Arabic words into the target language (L2 form recall). These tests were readministered five weeks after the treatment. The results revealed that the ACA and ATA groups performed significantly better on both L2 vocabulary spelling and L2 vocabulary recall in posttest and delayed test treatments than on L2 vocabulary spelling and recall in the pretest treatments. No significant difference was observed between the ACA and ATA groups in terms of vocabulary posttests. However, the ACA group slightly outscored the ATA group in the long-term L2 form recall tests (i.e., delayed tests). The results suggest that both types (i.e., ACA and ATA) help improve L2 vocabulary acquisition, whereas ACA surpasses ATA in aiding L2 vocabulary acquisition over a long term.

The students should see how technology development may change the affordances for language learning, at the same time transforming the teachers' professional roles and practices.

However, initial analyses of the research materials indicated that, despite the support, the students were not fully able to see their role as designers for the future. Cultural-historical activity theory was used to examine the problem more closely. The analysis suggests that in order to position themselves as designers of the future language learning activity, language students need to understand their role as designers, conduct real-life experiments on the evolving visions with their learners, and involve learners as participants in the design activity by sharing visions and collaborative reflection on the experiments.

This study examined an animation design course adopting CBI to promote reading abilities of English majors at a technology university in Taiwan. CBI usually adds challenges in cognitive and linguistic learning, especially for English majors in computer courses. Different from other CBI courses, this course dealt with multiple situations: multi-approaches (CBI and task-based instruction); multi-skills (Flash animation software skills--various animation effects; language skills--computer vocabulary and reading comprehension); multi-level learners (various English language proficiency levels--mostly low proficiency level; computer abilities; learning styles), and a large class taught by one instructor. Simply employing CBI cannot solve such complex problems. Therefore, instructional streaming video was applied as a learner-directed scaffold and a technological facilitator. A control group and an experimental group comprised 117 and 121 English majors taking this course for one semester respectively. Both groups were taught with English materials but the later were additionally provided with instructional streaming video (ISV). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from classroom observations, interviews, exams, and semester-end questionnaires from both groups to examine whether ISV facilitated instructor teaching and student learning.

Four subtests from Woodcock Munoz Language Survey-Revised (WMLS-R), a norm-referenced, standardized instrument, were selected to monitor participants' oral English development. A total of 76 urban, rural, and urban/marginal schools with 816 third graders were included in the analysis through multilevel modeling. Results suggested that (1) students held very limited oral English proficiency at the beginning of the third grade; (2) although students significantly improved their oral English proficiency during the 25-week intervention, they were still significantly below the typical native English-speaking norm at the end of the third-grade level; (3) those who were exposed to CALL modules in Treatment A developed at a faster rate than did students in Treatment B and in Control classrooms in lexical knowledge and listening skills when statistically controlling for student-level variables, including initial level and time-on-task; (4) although students in CALL intervention (especially in Treatment B) started with a lower level of oral English proficiency, their gain was numerically higher than that in the Control condition; and (5) time-on-task demonstrated to be an irrelevant variable in the study.

Despite the pervasiveness of e-book reading studies in higher education, most studies show that students' reactions to e-books are often negative. However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms. The different results may be due to different reading purposes. In addition, limited studies have investigated whether students' perceptions of e-books change over time since many of the e-book reading studies used a survey, rather than longitudinal, approach. Thus, this study intended to determine (1) English as a foreign language (EFL) college students' perceptions of e-books when they read for the purpose of responding to literature rather than for the purpose of intensively studying in an academic context; and (2) whether these perceptions change over time as based on a qualitative perspective. Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books. However, the e-book reading experience was still considered unpleasant to most of the participants in this study. This implies that the reading purpose may not have a great influence on students' perception of e-books.

Moreover, since their spelling errors are often competence errors arising from misconceptions about the target language, students might benefit from feedback that addresses the underlying problem rather than simply suggesting the correct word. This article describes the use of a corpus of learner English to identify common misspellings produced by Spanish learners of English.

The particular contribution of this study is twofold: to offer insight into patterns that characterize the literacy practices that emerge through the introduction of telecollaboration into the learning environment and to document the types of pedagogical decision-making that such projects introduce into the secondary context. Using a case-study design, we explored two central areas: (1) What patterns of interaction emerge in the literacy practices of adolescent students as they build relationships with their intercultural partners? (2) How do teachers address the pedagogical issues that are foregrounded when introducing innovative literacy practices such as telecollaboration into the secondary learning environment? Our premise is that online exchanges might offer a different kind of learning experience that provides opportunities for adolescents to engage with language in ways that do not typically get enacted in conventional language classrooms. Our interest therefore is grounded both in providing a rich, descriptive inventory of how adolescents engage with telecollaboration in the classroom context, as well as in documenting the types of pedagogical issues that are introduced. We offer a linguistically grounded portrait of what constitutes the interactional patterns and pedagogical issues in a classroom learning environment shaped by the introduction of an online intercultural project.

Social constructivist principles underpin TWP, which was designed to engender collaboration amongst its student participants. Not only does TWP provide links to evaluated Internet resources and a writing portfolio, but it also features collaboration tools such as the Group Forum, chat, a writing portfolio, a private messaging system, and a comment function for pages or articles created. Thus, it is very much akin to a &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for academic writing within a flexible and supportive environment. In this qualitative case study, 16 third-year TESL pre-service teachers at a Malaysian Teacher Education Institute embarked on a 12-week writing course using TWP. Qualitative data in the form of students' online discourses, task reflections, log files, and digital artefacts were captured to explore how TWP's affordances supported students' writing needs. In addition, Soller's collaborative learning conversation skills (CLCS) taxonomy was used as an analytical framework to investigate the collaborative learning engendered in the online environment. The findings indicate that TWP served its purpose by addressing students' writing needs at all stages of the writing process as they accomplished multiple writing tasks. Additionally, evidence of collaborative learning is evident in three functions of TWP: the Group Forum, chat, and the comments for pages/articles.

This study identifies variables within concordancing that may provide learners with diverging affordances, affordances that are not mutually compatible, and explores concordancing through a survey of concordance users' preferences. The data is analysed through a series of factor analyses which indicate that concordancing is a complex, multidimensional construct. It finds that there are at least four factors underlying the construct of concordancing: how citations are formatted, the type of corpus used, the order citations are presented in, and the task engaged in. Each of these factors represents a dimension of variance amongst concordance users. If it is safe to assume that concordance users' preferences are unlikely to be arbitrary, and are likely to indicate the affordances of concordancing in a particular configuration, then each factor represents a potentially significant variable in learner use of concordances.

This classroom-based study sought to identify the most efficient FFI-driven approach in tapping learners' lexical as well as comprehension gains by drawing largely on the protocols provided in Ellis (2008) and Laufer (2005). Eighty-eight Iranian students in four intact classes at Allameh Tabataba'i University (two FonF, one FonFs and one meaning-focused) were presented with a series of teacher-designed mini-lessons. Their medium of exposure was video podcasts (newscasts). Students' gains were measured by active immediate and delayed vocabulary and comprehension tests. A series of between-groups multivariate analyses of variance revealed that both FonF groups outperformed the FonFs in terms of all three variables. This indicates that the tendency to analyze words in isolation, despite intensive rehearsals typical of FonFs, failed to outweigh the FonF conditions in which contextual associations are prioritized.

Training involved eight sessions with feedback, including waveforms for the AV group. Results indicated significant improvement for the AV and A-only groups with generalization to novel stimuli and a new voice as well as transfer to production; the AV group showed a greater rate of improvement. Participants found waveform displays very helpful. Vowel type, preceding consonant, and pitch pattern significantly affected perception in testing and training as did the training talker's voice. The easiest pitch pattern was Low-High in the first syllable, perhaps reflecting English prosodic preference, and High--High in the second, which may be more salient.

Students ranged in grade level from freshmen to senior. Student demographics, including any existing pre-requisite knowledge, were unknown to camp designers prior to the start of the camp. Such unknowns presented five design constraints that required lateral solutions to address. Chiefly, a peer learning design was deployed that allowed participants to self-organize and autonomously explore learning within secure systems administration, network security, and cryptography. Furthermore, camp participants were provided with three objects to guide the peer learning objective: a booklet containing fundamental commands within the camp knowledge areas, a Xubuntu virtual machine as a digital playground, and a digital scavenger hunt game to reinforce acquired knowledge. Observational data indicate that peer learning was a successful pedagogy. Further, the results demonstrate compelling knowledge and behavioral flows amongst participants. Accordingly, this paper goes on to suggest a Community of Practice (CofP) as an organizational umbrella to support ongoing peer learning in the cybersecurity field. The paper also calls for future research to support the development of peer learning and CofP structures to support cybersecurity education.", "subject": "Peer Relationship, Cooperative Learning, High School Students, Observation, Grade 9, Grade 10, Grade 11, Grade 12, Communities of Practice, Instructional Design, Internet, Computer Security, Information Security, Computer Networks, Day Camp Programs", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1135271", "title": "The Design and Evaluation of Class Exercises as Active Learning Tools in Software Verification and Validation", "author": "Wu, Peter Y., Manohar, Priyadarshan A., Acharya, Sushil", "description": "It is well known that interesting questions can stimulate thinking and invite participation.

Every college graduate should learn to think critically, solve problems, and communicate solutions, but 90% of students are not prepared for white collar jobs. Active learning pedagogy, which involves students directly in their own learning, improves these skills, but active learning exercises are difficult to implement in traditional rank-and-file classrooms. Students are accustomed to passive lectures and they tune out or stare at screens, further frustrating overworked faculty. In this article, we showcase the impacts of creating a modular space to support multiple arrangements and new activities, particularly group discussions. This room included state-of-the-art collaborative tools to support group work and writeable tables to encourage creative expression. Creativity is essential to discovering new solutions to difficult problems. Students reported that this combination of environment plus pedagogic change broke them out of their stupor.

Students are required to participate in four live video conferences with their professor and a small group of peers in all upper division online courses as a minimum requirement for passing the class. While these synchronous video conferences create some challenges in implementation, they address concerns about academic integrity in three important ways. First, they provide a structured space for faculty to be present with students in a face-to-face manner. Second, they provide important checks to avoid impersonation schemes which are a common concern with online coursework. Third, they assist students in keeping up on the course material, which may mitigate the temptation to cheat. As distance learning courses and online programs have exploded in number, the issue of academic integrity has taken center stage for program design. In this paper, we share a case of a program built to address academic integrity issues through the regular and highly structured use of small group video conferencing as a requirement for all courses.

Given a noun-verb construction as input, our system generates possible noun or verb correction candidates based on noun and verb corrections extracted from a large Japanese learner corpus. We use this corpus to investigate the learner's tendency to commit collocation errors, and to produce a smaller and more realistic set of candidates. After combining nouns or verbs with the generated candidates to form noun-verb pairs, the system uses the Weighted Dice coefficient as the association measure to filter out inappropriate noun-verb pairs and rank the proper collocations.

Research on Internet addiction, initiated by Kimberly Young at the end of the twentieth century, usually appears in the literature in the context of young people who have been found to be most vulnerable. The phenomenon is known as Adolescent Internet Addiction. Compulsive use of the Internet is a complex phenomenon, its effects being visible in almost all aspects of a young person's social life. It is manifested in a variety of pathological behaviors and emotional states grouped into several major psycho-physical and social effects that may appear simultaneously, e.g. anger, depression, loneliness or anxiety associated with the lack of access to the network, the weakening of social ties, withdrawal from real life, lack of educational achievement, chronic fatigue or deteriorating health. The authors of this study aim to assess the level of Internet addiction among adolescents in Poland and indicate its main behavioral manifestations, in the students surveyed, which influence their pathological use of the Internet. Our study involved a total of 505 students from three high schools located in Rzeszow (N = 505) and was carried out by questionnaires, including, among others, The Problematic Use of the Internet (PUI) which is the Polish adaptation of Kimberly Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) (Cronbach's a = 0.89). Statistical analysis of responses from the PUI test allowed us to determine (1) the level of Internet addiction among these adolescents, whereas the univariate (ANOVA) analysis enabled us (2) to verify the hypothesis of the existence of differences in the level of Internet addiction among the investigated groups as far as gender, place of residence or grade are concerned. Generally, the results obtained in our research indicate that the level of Internet addiction among the adolescents investigated is not very high, although two thirds of our respondents showed an above average level of addiction, and every ninth respondent (approximately 11%) was highly addicted to the Internet, men being more often addicted (15.6%) than women (8.3%).", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Internet, Social Media, Addictive Behavior, Adolescents, Adolescent Attitudes, Questionnaires, Access to Computers, Use Studies, Time on Task, Computer Use, Handheld Devices, Computer Mediated Communication, Information Seeking, High School Students, Student Attitudes, Measures (Individuals), Statistical Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Gender Differences, Pathology", "source": "Practice and Theory in Systems of Education", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Poland"}, {"id": "EJ1135341", "title": "Streamlining the Capstone Process: A Time-Saving Approval System for Graduate Theses/Projects", "author": "Grooms, James, Kline, Douglas, Cummings, Jeffrey", "description": "Capstones have become an integral part of many information systems programs, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.

At the same time, technical writers create, reuse, remix, and remarket content on a regular basis in the form of instruction manuals, boilerplates, and other technical, factual, straightforward texts. In academia, the technical writer would be accused of (self-) plagiarism, which would not--given the context--be the case.

To achieve this aim, CALL employs technological innovations to create novel types of language practice. Evaluations of the new practice types serve the important role of distinguishing effective practice environments from less effective environments, while simultaneously informing educational practices and second language acquisition (SLA) theory. Accordingly, evaluations of CALL systems necessarily deal with multiple criteria. Most researchers would probably agree that motivation is an important criterion in CALL evaluations: a system can provide sufficient L2 input and opportunities for L2 output, yet fail to be pedagogically effective if learners are unwilling to participate. Furthermore, knowledge of the motivational impact of practice can provide valuable context linking individual language learners, practice effort and learning outcomes. From the perspective of recent theoretical developments in L2 motivation theory, this paper surveys a representative sample of CALL system evaluations that include motivational impact. Our analysis suggests not only that CALL needs to do more to align its treatment of motivation with recent L2 motivation theories, but also that it is well positioned to do so. We find that: (1) few CALL studies treat motivation as it relates to practice as a dynamic variable; (2) behavioural practice logs are underexploited; and (3) very few evaluations take into account learners' individual interests and goals. Drawing on these and other findings, we suggest four new directions for developing the motivation dimension in CALL evaluations.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Program Evaluation, Predictor Variables, Student Behavior, Student Interests, Goal Orientation, Computer Assisted Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1100937", "title": "Language Views on Social Networking Sites for Language Learning: The Case of Busuu", "author": "\u00c1lvarez Valencia, Jos\u00e9 Aldemar", "description": "Social networking has compelled the area of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) to expand its research palette and account for new virtual ecologies that afford language learning and socialization.

One aspect of this phenomenon namely, use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), has expanded significantly, highlighting the need for a review. This paper analyzes findings from 10 learner-based studies that draw on accounts of SLA informed by cognitive and sociocultural theories. Analysis reveals that research conducted from the sociocultural perspective provides evidence of constructs identified as playing a central role in SLA. Analysis indicates that playing MMORPGs elicits target language dialogue involving collaboration, assistance and co-construction. Data show that MMORPGs provide access to conditions conducive to the operation of zones of proximal development. Findings show that this type of game provides access to both in-game and extramural communities of practice that facilitate language socialization. Research undertaken from a cognitive perspective shows that participation in MMORPG-based gaming facilitates production of the target language. However, this work does not provide conclusive evidence that game play elicits forms of interaction such as negotiation, that are hypothesized as playing a central role in learning in the cognitive account of SLA. Studies conducted from both perspectives draw attention to positive learner attitudes indicating high levels of motivation. The analysis reveals that although studies are subject to limitations, they have produced promising results.

To validate our approach we apply the framework to two writing tasks for learners of English as a foreign language. Our analysis highlights the relevance of spelling out the pedagogical and linguistic goals of language learning tasks in order to successfully characterize the language expected and actually elicited in learner responses, to evaluate the realization of the task, and to support the design of effective NLP strategies.

To date, nearly 30 CALL-SLA syntheses and meta-analyses have been conducted, covering topics from hypertext glosses (Yun, 2011) to synchronous computer-mediated communication (Ziegler, 2015) to game-based learning (Chiu, Kao, &amp; Reynolds, 2012).

Like other online journals started in the 1990s, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to enhance the speed of publication and the accessibility of published research. Yet &quot;LLT&quot; had an additional goal: to raise the rigor of published research in its targeted area. Thus, rather than seeking to be defined principally by its mode or style of publication, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to be the highest quality journal in an emerging area of inquiry. This sounds like an obvious goal, but &quot;LLT&quot; was going against the grain. By the time the first issue of &quot;LLT&quot; appeared in 1997, there was already a popular notion of a dichotomy between print journals (which alone printed rigorous peer reviewed research) and online journals (which were accessible but not rigorously reviewed). Indeed, at the time, many academics refused to submit work to online journals, believing (or knowing) that their institutions would fail to recognize articles published in online venues. To break out of this stereotype, &quot;LLT&quot; recruited a top notch editorial board, including leading applied linguistics from around the world. For its inaugural issue in July 1997, the journal invited internationally recognized applied linguistics to submit papers on the topic Language Learning &amp; Technology: Defining the Research Agenda. The resources of the NFLRC and CLEAR were used to achieve broad publicity. &quot;LLT&quot; quickly gathered broad attention. With questions of funding, peer review, and other matters still under debate, the future of academic journal publishing is very much in flux.

However, the authors feel that limiting the use of Cultura to those questionnaires is not only reductionist but it can also be counterproductive because, when used alone, the questionnaires accentuate a simplistic, binary approach to culture.

In addition to more travel options and greater technology availability, study abroad has changed in other significant ways. In the US, more students are going abroad for short-term programs (less than 8 weeks), and the participants represent more diverse academic fields, with an increasing number of students from the sciences, social sciences, and business-related fields. The image of the North American student going abroad primarily for language learning, spending a semester or more, no longer fits reality.

Nevertheless, study abroad remains an expected experience for students with a serious interest in language learning.

Universities and colleges provide specific honor codes or have administrative units to promote good behaviors and resolve dishonesty allegations. Students, faculty, and staff have stakes in maintaining high levels of academic integrity to ensure their degrees' value and preserve respect for their institutions. Often, these efforts result in disparate local dialogs and various approaches to create and maintain cultures of integrity. Despite this, academic integrity receives relatively little attention in the academic literature. Several underlying reasons may exist. First, people generally do not want to reveal dishonest actions and this makes research difficult. Second, students come from a variety of backgrounds and cultural settings with different perspectives on academic integrity; some from high school environments with differing views on academic integrity. This context has resulted in the growth of information services and software products designed to structure and enable academic integrity activities and compliance. However, taken by themselves, these services provide only a partial solution. The current special issue is set against this dynamic backdrop and seeks to bring necessary discussions into the open, particularly for those teaching and researching in areas related to information systems.

The analysis of the test takers' verbal reports from stimulated recalls indicates that various cognitive, metacognitive, and communication strategies were used while performing the Virtual Interactive Tasks for Aviation English Assessment, and that there is a positive relationship between the total number of cognitive and metacognitive strategies adopted and the test scores.

However, how learners undertake such negotiation work and what kind of an impact it has on interactional development in an L2 are still largely unknown mainly due to a lack of focus on task engagement processes. A conversation analytic investigation into negotiation of meaning (NoM) in task-oriented interactions can bring evidence to such development, as conversation analysis (CA), given its analytic tools, allows us to see how participant orientations in interaction evolve over time. Based on an examination of screen-recorded multiparty online task-oriented interactions, this study aimed to describe how users (n=8) of an L2 (1) negotiate and co-construct language and task rules and (2) later show orientations to these rules both in the short term (50 minutes) and in the long term (8 weeks). The findings showed that in addition to negotiating existing rules, the learners co-constructed new rules around an action called policing, which occurred when the learners attended to the breach of language and task rules. Furthermore, even after the negotiation work was completed, they oriented to negotiated rules through policing their own utterances (i.e. self-policing). Overall, this interactional continuum (from other-repairs to self-repairs) brought longitudinal evidence to bear on the role of NoM in the development of L2 interactional competence.

Specifically, 3D virtual worlds have especially attracted the interest of educators and academics due to the multiplicity of verbal channels, which are often comprised of text and voice channels, as well as their 3D graphical interface, allowing for the study of non-verbal modes. This study offers a multilayered transcription method called the Multi-Modal MUVE Method or 3M Method (Palomeque, 2016; Pujol\u00e0 &amp; Palomeque, 2010) to account for the different modes present in the 3D virtual world of Second Life. This method works at two levels: the macro and the micro level. The macro level is a bird's-eye view representation of the whole session as it fits into one page. This enables the researcher to grasp the essence of the class and to identify interesting sequences for analysis. The micro level consists of three transcripts to account for the different communication modes as well as the interface activity that occurs in the virtual world of Second Life. This paper will review the challenges when dealing with multimodal analysis in virtual worlds and how the multimodal data were analyzed and interpreted by using a multilayered multimodal method of analysis (3M transcription). Examples will be provided in the study to show how different modes of communication were used by participants in the virtual world of Second Life to create meaning or to avoid communication breakdowns.", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Computer Assisted Instruction, Teaching Methods, Computer Mediated Communication, Communication Problems, Communication Strategies, Discourse Analysis", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1165786", "title": "CALL from an Ecological Perspective: How a Teacher Perceives Affordance and Fosters Learner Agency in a Technology-Mediated Language Classroom", "author": "Liu, Qian, Chao, Chin-Chi", "description": "The possibility of exploiting technology for more robust and meaningful learning and teaching has invoked messianic responses from the language education community.

The participants were 84 first-year Japanese medical university students. The recall and recognition of word forms and word meanings, and passage comprehension data were analysed using the Rasch model.

First, if only the results that were statistically significant are considered, there might be two conditions to learn words and comprehend reading passages: the spell condition seems to be best for learning the forms and meanings of words, and the control condition for promoting passage comprehension. Second, if the results that were both statistically significant and measurably different are considered, the spell, click, and control conditions might promote the learning of word forms, word meanings, and passage comprehension, respectively. Third, however, the click condition might promote both the learning of word meanings and passage comprehension because its effects were measurably higher to the spell condition on these measures.

Overcoming the weaknesses commonly associated with traditional narrative review and vote counting, meta-analysis is a statistical method of systematically aggregating and analyzing empirical studies by following well-established procedures. The findings of a meta-analysis, when appropriately conducted, are able to inform important policy decisions and provide practical pedagogical suggestions. With the growing number of publications employing meta-analysis across a wide variety of disciplines, it has received criticism due to its inconsistent findings derived from multiple meta-analyses in the same research domain. These inconsistencies have arisen partly due to the alternatives available to meta-analysts in each major meta-analytic procedure. Researchers have therefore recommended transparent reporting on the decision-making for every essential judgment call so that the results across multiple meta-analyses become replicable, consistent, and interpretable. This research explored the degree to which meta-analyses in the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) discipline transparently reported their decisions in every critical step. To achieve this aim, we retrieved 15 eligible meta-analyses in CALL published between 2003 and 2015. Features of these meta-analyses were extracted based on a codebook modified from Cooper (2003) and Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou and Kern (2012).

A further 58% were characterised as either two-word phrases (45%), three-word phrases (9%), or four- and five-word phrases (4%) which are either absent from or rare in a large corpus of English which is known to be correct. The nature of software which can detect such words and phrases and bring them to students' attention with a view to self-correction is briefly described. Of the remaining 21% of errors not detected by such software, most were found to be either errors of tense (7%), misuse of false friends (4%) or problems with determiners (3%). Again, software which can help students detect and correct such errors is outlined.

Non-computing major students have limited opportunities to take a data analytics related course. The computing major programs have the resource limit for offering none-major electives. The first-generation-college-bound students need more mentoring for their future directions.

To accomplish these goals, we start with developing a series of summer workshops that is Evidence-Based Practices (EBP)-guided, student-driven, and applied. Based upon the EBPs, we develop a series of student-driven summer workshops, not a regular elective course, with an emphasis on application of data analytics to the main areas in which the students are interested.

However, little research has explored factors that contribute to team performance during an ERPsim game. The current study investigated teamwork as a contributor to team performance in the context of a competition. The research measured teamwork in five dimensions: contributing to the team's work, interacting with teammates, keeping the team on track, expecting quality, and having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA). Net income was the measure for team performance. Participants also rated their satisfaction with their team. Data from 62 student teams showed that all 5 teamwork dimensions had a positive correlation with net income. Moreover, all correlations were statistically significant except the relationship between keeping the team on track and net income. Teams with relevant KSA were more likely to generate higher net income. Expecting quality was the second most significant dimension, followed by interacting with teammates and contributing to the team's work. All five teamwork dimensions had a significant positive correlation with team satisfaction. This research suggests that students will likely engage in good teamwork during a game if it is set up as a high-stakes competition. Additionally, good teamwork will likely result in higher team performance and satisfaction.

In this study, we measured the effects of experienced uncertainty on students' performance in an Agile systems development course and how uncertainty affected the quality of the system developed by the students using Scrum. We implemented the course using a problem based learning (PBL) approach and simulated uncertainty through various work environment reflecting concepts. Our study reveals that the effects of uncertainty are fairly similar among students and software professionals, and we identified three different coping strategies that students used with varying degrees of success.

However, the software is costly and is difficult for colleges and students to afford. With the advent of inexpensive credit card-sized computing devices like the Raspberry Pi and its partnership with Mathematica, the software can now be used at no cost. However, processing and speed are limited and performance is affected on a Raspberry Pi.

Results show that short video-pills are the most powerful learning objects in this type of online courses, the regular submission of automated grading activities is a robust indicator towards course success, and the most prominent student profile in LMOOCs is 'viewers', those who access the learning materials but do not submit tasks or engage in online interaction actively, which would explain why the completion rate in LMOOCs is so low. This novel perspective into students' language learning, which big data has assisted us in, should guide course creators to re-design the LMOOC for the enhancement of the audio-visual content. LMOOC instructors and facilitators should also encourage participants to increase the submission of activities--acknowledging these small achievements through micro-credentialing and badges-, and special attention ought to be paid to the most prominent LMOOC profile, those 'viewers' who should be lured into becoming 'solvers' or, even better, 'all-rounders'.", "subject": "Large Group Instruction, Online Courses, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Second Language Instruction, Interaction, Computer Mediated Communication, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Educational Research, Resource Units, Correlation, Student Characteristics, Video Technology, Student Participation, Age Differences, Multiple Intelligences, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1176572", "title": "Learning a Minority Language through Authentic Conversation Using an Online Social Learning Method", "author": "Henry, Michael, Carroll, Fiona, Cunliffe, Daniel, Kop, Rita", "description": "Advances in technology are currently helping to speed up the globalisation of 'super' languages.

A key approach to this investigation of the past research is to ascertain how the learners process the videos; there is obviously the need for the learners to listen, to some degree, for their listening abilities to develop. The investigation finds that less-proficient learners tend more to read texts than listen to them, while more-proficient learners generally utilize a wider range of cues (caption, speaker and visual), although various factors may mediate these trends.

Throughout a semester, the students were required to complete three peer review tasks through Turnitin. Based on the instructor's experience and the students' reports, we found that Turnitin could help shift students' attention from local to global issues in writing, scaffold students in their effort to provide more helpful comments and to make connections between specific suggestions and holistic advice for writing, and facilitate classroom management during peer review.", "subject": "Peer Evaluation, Feedback (Response), English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Student Attitudes, Teacher Attitudes, Academic Discourse, Undergraduate Students, Questionnaires, Computer Software, Program Effectiveness", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1192913", "title": "Online Informal Language Learning: Insights from a Korean Learning Community", "author": "Isbell, Daniel R.", "description": "Informal language learning in online communities represents a growing area of interest.

Results suggest that three minutes of planning time resulted in increases in lexical complexity (but not phrasal or syntactic), although no significant findings were identified for accuracy or fluency.

The recognition of writing as a social act has also led to a significant rise in interest in collaborative writing. This has been aided by the popularity of tools providing a shared writing space, such as Google Docs. The importance and recognition of genre in both student work and writing theory have grown considerably among practitioners and researchers. The increased practice of integrating multimedia into writing is reflected in the popularity of multimodal projects, such as digital storytelling.

The purpose of the study is to understand how teachers and students exploit the complementarity of the two delivery formats to improve the learning experience. The study first examines how the presence of an online component affects the F2F portion of the course by comparing it to a corresponding section of the same course taught entirely F2F. The findings of this first part of the study show major differences between the two delivery formats regarding teaching strategies and teaching presence. The second part of the study uses LMS data to analyze student participation in the online component of the blended course. Data were gathered to measure active participation, passive participation and continuity. The results show that online behaviors distinguish less successful students from more successful ones, and that there is a strong correlation between low levels of online participation and low grades in the course. Continuity proved to be the strongest predictor variable for success in the course.

Instead of the performance pattern found in the previous study (more glossary led to higher gains), we identified one learner group who exhibited their ability to make successful use of concordance lines (and thus are optimized for data-driven learning, or DDL; Johns, 1991), and another group who showed limited L2 vocabulary learning when exposed to concordance lines only. Further, our results revealed that L2 proficiency intersects with vocabulary gains of different learner types in complex ways.

Data on corpus usage history (e.g. times of access, duration of use), query syntax (e.g. query lexis/phraseology and use of wildcards and part-of-speech tags), query function (e.g. frequency lists/distribution, concordance sorting and collocation) and query filters (e.g. searches by faculty, discipline, or thesis section) were collected from 327 students spanning over 11,000 individual corpus queries. The results show significant interdisciplinary and inter-/intra-user trends and variation in the use of particular corpus functions and query syntax adopted by corpus users. Students varied in the type of knowledge (e.g. domain-specific, language-specific) they were accessing, and frequently went beyond the exemplars of the DDL course materials to generate unique queries under their own initiative. Qualitative case study data from three corpus users' activity logs also show distinctive individual corpus engagement by query frequency and function.

Quantitative data were collected from two surveys, the online self-regulated English learning (OSEL) and the attitude toward wiki-based literature circles (AWLC), among 228 university students in China. Qualitative data were collected from a follow-up interview of 13 participants to explore further the interplay between the students' online self-regulation and their attitude. The results indicated that students hold positive attitude toward learning through wiki-based literature circles in terms of perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, affection, and behavior. The findings partially confirmed the positive correlations between students' self-regulated learning strategies and their attitudes. More interestingly, stepwise regression analysis revealed that students' goal setting acted as a significant predicator of their perceived usefulness of and self-efficacy in completing wiki-based literature circles activities. Self-evaluation was found to be the variable to predict the learners' affection for and behavior in doing this task. This study highlighted the positive role of students' goal setting and self-evaluation for explaining their attitude toward wiki-based collaborative learning.

Many teachers do not know how to teach correct pronunciation due to lack of knowledge in pronunciation pedagogy even if they want to or they assume that students pick it up on their own. With the development of technology, automatic speech recognition (ASR) software has been adopted in computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) and has been found to be effective in facilitating pronunciation learning. Nevertheless, CAPT software still has its limitation. Very little research has been done on what difficulties students may encounter during practice with the system, such as how to read the feedback provided by the software. Moreover, very few CAPT studies investigated how collaborative learning can be integrated to augment the advantages of the technology. Efforts also have to be made on how to increase the enjoyment of learners using it when their motivation is curtailed by the unchanging feedback the CAPT system provides. The present study aims to investigate how those software users feel about the mediated assistance the system offers, their difficulty and attitudes toward using it, and, above all, how peers can help to mediate the pronunciation learning of students using &quot;MyET,&quot; a CAPT system designed in Taiwan. Two groups of junior college students (N = 60) practiced the system for 10 weeks with or without their peers. A qualitative investigation found that the collaborative group wrote down more statements about how they had benefited from the software than about their pronunciation difficulties. They also reported that the feedback helped raise their awareness of pronunciation errors. In the collaborative practice with the CAPT system, they revealed that they could explore more functions the software provided and had fun. This study further examines how peers interacted, analyzed, and discussed the effects of collaboration on computer-assisted pronunciation learning.

In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based computational model to simulate the environment to which students are exposed. The ANN computational model equips English teachers with the ability to quickly find the predicting factors to learners' overall English competences and also provides teachers with the ability to find abnormal students, based on reviewing their individualized ANN trajectories. Finally, by observing the compound effects of cognitive factors using the same evaluation scale, new hypotheses about the mutual relationships among the phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory, and long-term memory abilities of their students can be generated.

Traditionally, this involves assigning a one-dimensional label to the text that identifies the grade or proficiency level of the learners that the text is intended for. Such an approach is inadequate given that both the text complexity and proficiency constructs are multi-dimensional in nature. We propose to instead link readers and texts through multidimensional vectors characterizing the linguistic complexity of the reading material and that of texts written by the learners as proxy of their proficiency level. We first validate the approach using a leveled reading corpus by showing that vector distances computed on the complexity representations can serve the function of the traditional labels.

We begin with an overview of the three preceding concepts with particular attention to interdisciplinarity in contemporary CALL. We then explore the notion of transdisciplinarity as an emerging theme in applied linguistics, arguably the field most closely related to CALL. In the following section, we look at theoretical options that are less connected to single disciplinary positions and represent the interdisciplinary state of the field and its movement toward transdisciplinarity. We expand on the basic notion of CALL as a potential transdisciplinary field and provide a descriptive framework of transdisciplinary types. The final section offers a model for visualizing transdisciplinarity for CALL with accompanying examples, arguing for a set of common transdisciplinary notions and a lingua franca for CALL stakeholders from a range of disciplines to use when communicating.

This extends to the current pedagogy for teaching systems analysis and design (SA&amp;D). However, overemphasizing agile and DevOps neglects broader dimensions that are essential for planning and executing enterprise-level systems projects. Thus, a dilemma may arise: do we teach agile and DevOps techniques that may be inadequate for enterprise-level projects or do we teach the wider range of plan-driven skills and techniques that may conflict with the tenets and benefits of agile and DevOps? In this paper, we advocate for resolving this dilemma by adopting a generalized process framework that both fully supports enterprise-level projects but can also be selectively scaled back toward increased agility for smaller, less complex projects. In its full realization, this framework combines extensive project planning and up-front requirements with iterative delivery -- an increasingly popular approach today for enterprise projects. In scaling back toward agile, the framework carefully accounts for system, environment, and team characteristics. Further, the model emphasizes issues frequently underemphasized by agile approaches, including the use of external software such as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and open source products and components; the need for business-oriented project planning and justification; and support for change management to ensure successful system adoption.

IS education researchers recognize the importance of these skills for future IS practitioners given the complexity of the technology based society and economy of the future. However, there is limited work on how these skills are best taught in IS. This research reports on a course focusing on the explicit development of critical thinking and problem solving skills of first-year IS students at the University of Pretoria. The critical thinking part of the course focuses on the analysis, evaluation of, and response to arguments. Class discussions and assessments are based on local, authentic arguments. In the problem solving skills component of the course, students are taught to understand the nature of a problem and to classify it as belonging to one of three categories: puzzles, problems, and messes. For each category, appropriate problem solving approaches are suggested and practiced. To illustrate the role of design and creativity in problem solving, students have to create an artefact using the Maker Space of the university. They have to apply the five phases of design thinking as suggested by the Stanford d.school design thinking approach. The course has been presented since 2016, and feedback is collected from students annually. Based on a feedback questionnaire that the students complete at the end of each course, we have reason to believe that they find the course valuable and consider those skills to be applicable to other courses as well as elsewhere in their lives.
