[{"id":"EJ1137149","title":"Including a Programming Course in General Education: Are We Doing Enough?","author":"Ferguson, Roger C., Leidig, Paul M., Reynolds, John H.","description":"General education is more than a list of required courses a student must take to complete their degree. For most universities, general education is the groundwork for the student's university experience. These courses span multiple disciplines and allow students to experience a wide range of topics on their path to graduation. Programming classes, e.g., Introduction to Programming, have not typically been an option as part of a general education course sequence at most universities. This study found that, only half of universities offer any kind of programming course in the General Education (GenEd) Program. The data also show that only two-thirds of institutions offer a computing class of any kind as a general education option. Institutions with ABET accredited Information Systems (IS) programs are significantly lower in both of these categories. This paper demonstrates the reasoning and process for including a programming class as an option in a GenEd Program, thereby showing how a programming class can be used to satisfy the requirements of a general education course. This results in two significant advantages to the computing department and university since the departments expand their reach to many more students, with a potential of increasing the number of majors or minors within the department; and non-computing majors have the opportunity to take courses that have not traditionally been offered in the GenEd Program. The latter results in students receiving a more comprehensive education and exposure to skills in high demand.","subject":"Programming, Programming Languages, General Education, Required Courses, College Students, Introductory Courses, Computer Science Education, Majors (Students), Nonmajors, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1109645","title":"Teaching Tip: Active Learning via a Sample Database: The Case of Microsoft's Adventure Works","author":"Mitri, Michel","description":"This paper describes the use and benefits of Microsoft's Adventure Works (AW) database to teach advanced database skills in a hands-on, realistic environment. Database management and querying skills are a key element of a robust information systems curriculum, and active learning is an important way to develop these skills. To facilitate active learning and produce a compelling narrative, the data structure and content of a useful pedagogically-oriented database should be realistic and lifelike. It should contain data that accurately depicts the business processes, functions, and entities of a realistic organization, structured in a way that demonstrates best practices in database design. Most database textbooks include sample databases, but these are often small and sparse of data. By contrast, Microsoft's AW database presents a robust, realistic, and comprehensive framework for many important educational objectives in an IS curriculum. This paper introduces the AW business case and database, and illustrates several pedagogical uses in an undergraduate CIS program.","subject":"Active Learning, Databases, Computer Software, Educational Benefits, Case Method (Teaching Technique), Case Studies, Skill Development, Information Systems, Curriculum Development, Educational Technology, Business Education, Best Practices, Database Design, Problem Based Learning, Problem Solving, Database Management Systems, Educational Objectives, Undergraduate Study, Computer Science Education, Programming Languages, Information Retrieval, Student Attitudes","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1137403","title":"Where Do Student Outcomes Begin?

Often, the impediments to student success were not technical in nature and prompted faculty to consider non-technical solutions. A framework for the interaction and interdependency of the technical and non-technical skills, termed the &quot;Blue and Green Curve&quot; is presented that describes balancing emphasis on the technical curriculum (Blue Curve) and professional and personal management skills (Green Curve) that have the potential to accelerate students' acquisition of technical skills. The framework prescribes a foundation of effective habits to establish early in a student's academic career. Guided by this framework, changes to a freshman-level programming fundamentals course in the CIS program are described. Pedagogical tools with assignments and rubrics that support the curriculum changes are shared. These changes, among others factors, may have contributed to a 10% increase in the freshman persistence rate over a two semester period.","subject":"Computer Science Education, Outcomes of Education, Skill Development, Business Administration Education, Business Schools, Barriers, Introductory Courses, College Freshmen, Curriculum Development, College Curriculum, Assignments, Scoring Rubrics, Job Skills, Case Studies, Behavioral Objectives","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Texas"},{"id":"EJ1113940","title":"From Tech Skills to Life Skills: Google Online Marketing Challenge and Experiential Learning","author":"Croes, Jo-Anne V., Visser, Melina M.","description":"The Google Online Marketing Challenge (GOMC) is a global, online student competition sponsored by Google. It is a prime example of an experiential learning activity that includes using real money ($250 sponsored by Google) with a real client.

However, few studies have systematically scrutinized the broader personal and life skills inherent in experience-based learning. The current study explores learning outcomes of the GOMC from a student perspective including both the direct technical skills as well as broader, multidisciplinary life skills that are developed or enhanced. The study takes an inductive approach to examine the life skills endorsed by a pilot group of GOMC participants and subsequently examines these learning outcomes in a preliminary quantitative survey of 15 GOMC participants from an undergraduate Information Systems course. Study findings yielded perceived learning outcomes in the following areas: interpersonal life skills, digital technical skills directly related to course and challenge content, intrapersonal life skills (self-awareness, reflection, and strategic planning), and adaptive applied skills.

To address this, we developed a simulation for students to learn requirements gathering and analysis where they experience the requirements by operating a fictitious manufacturing firm. The students manage and operate the company, taking on a variety of employee roles from the physical &quot;manufacturing&quot; to the order-taking to the purchasing of component parts. With this pedagogical approach, students deal with the messiness of the problem by drawing on their own experience working in the manufacturing firm, making assumptions, and having the opportunity to verify their assumptions and analyses by working with their classmates.

This approach with a model considers explicit learning as a part of tutoring relationship successes. A prospective study on a short scale provides a few indicators in this direction and will be followed by a mentoring study. As private companies also present services in the shadow of the official educational system some recommendations will illustrate the tutoring original pedagogical relation with specific limits and the potential for new understanding.","subject":"Tutoring, Mentors, Motivation, Preservice Teachers, Learning Processes, Qualitative Research, Interviews, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1121048","title":"Towards a Methodology to Identify a Talent by Using Psychological Cognitive Prototyping","author":"Hammer, Matthijs H.

We get our information seeing. Examination of images is free, while reading is impelled by the necessity of browsing the whole text. The image seems more appropriate than the text when trying to communicate easy and quickly. The speech calls for articulated language, expressed through a symbolic set of oral or written codes that we must master. Understanding an image requires less work and fewer skills than reading a text. This paper aims to highlight how messages are perceived and received within the educational activities, through the two types of communication, iconic and logical-linguistic. The instrument used in conducting the research was represented by a questionnaire consisting from objective and subjective items, applied to students from high schools in Oradea. Besides these questionnaires, a key role in the study was played by the knowledge gained while observing lessons held by students of the University of Oradea within their teaching placement, as well as while supervising teachers from secondary educational institutions in the process of obtaining teacher certification level 1. The obtained results prove that the majority of investigated students prefer the combination of two types of communication in teaching.","subject":"High School Students, Learning Modalities, Visual Learning, Questionnaires, Intermode Differences, Interpersonal Communication, Learning Activities, Teaching Methods, Preferences, Cognitive Style, Educational Practices, Foreign Countries","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Romania"},{"id":"EJ1121003","title":"Development of Walking and Self-Sufficiency Ability Related to Nutrition among People with Down Syndrome","author":"Brantm\u00fcller, \u00c9va, Gyur\u00f3, Monika, Kar\u00e1csony, Ilona","description":"Development of the walking ability and self-care of patients with Down syndrome is affected by their body weight determining their lifestyle to a great extent. Objectives: The study aimed at the determination of body mass index for persons living in residential institutions and families, exploration its impact on walking and self-care as two, objective factors of life quality. Method: Data collection of persons aged 3-35 with Down syndrome living in families covered seven counties, while those of living in residential institutions covered thirteen counties in Hungary. In the 183 cases studied 76 people in residential institutions, 107 people lived in families. The cross-sectional study was processed by non-random sample selection. The questionnaires were filled out by health visitors and care takers edited by their own. Results: 50.6% of adults and 26.1% of children belonged to the overweight or obese category. Their residence showed a significant correlation with the body mass index (p&lt; 0.001). Overweight and obese persons in families, while thin ones were more prevalent in institutions. Regarding the walking ability and self-care of the persons living in families a significantly higher level of development was achieved (p&lt; 0.001). Walking ability (p = 0.001) and self-care (p = 0,008) were worsened by less body weight significantly, while overweight or obesity influenced it less negatively. Discussion: The claim is not further acceptable whereas persons with Down syndrome are more prone to obesity than average people. However unfavourable weight gain in adults draws attention to the necessity to a healthy diet and regular exercise. The people living in residential institutions with significantly lower body mass index and the associated low development of walking ability and self-care envisages an urgent reform of residential institutions. Life in the institutions negatively affects the walking ability and self-care, and thus significantly reduces the quality of life of persons with Down's syndrome.","subject":"Personal Autonomy, Physical Activities, Nutrition, Down Syndrome, Questionnaires, Obesity, Body Weight, Life Style, Body Composition, Daily Living Skills, Residential Care, Family Environment, Case Studies, Caregiver Attitudes, Health Personnel, Correlation, Foreign Countries, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"}]
