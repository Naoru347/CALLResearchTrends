[{"id":"EJ1051720","title":"ESL Teacher Training in 3D Virtual Worlds","author":"Kozlova, Iryna, Priven, Dmitri","description":"Although language learning in 3D Virtual Worlds (VWs) has become a focus of recent research, little is known about the knowledge and skills teachers need to acquire to provide effective task-based instruction in 3D VWs and the type of teacher training that best prepares instructors for such an endeavor. This study employs a situated learning approach to teacher training and explores what online teaching skills emerge in the process of collaborative situated learning, how these skills develop, and whether collaborative situated learning is an effective method of training instructors to teach in 3D VWs. Six English as a second language (ESL) teacher trainees enrolled in the Teaching English as a Second\/Foreign Language (TES\/FL) program participated in the study. During the preteaching stage, teacher trainees developed language tasks to implement during the teaching stage with eight EFL students in 3D VWs. Blackboard wikis used for designing tasks allowed for observing the acquisition of five 3D-specific, integrated skills. The analysis of teaching sessions recorded through screen capturing software Camtasia Relay in conjunction with the teacher trainees' wikis and journals demonstrates that for this group of teachers, a situated learning approach was an effective method of teacher training.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Teacher Education, Educational Technology, Virtual Classrooms, Online Courses, Teaching Skills, Cooperative Learning, Skill Development, Preservice Teachers, Technology Uses in Education, Computer Software, Web Sites, Web 2.0 Technologies, Context Effect, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Content Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada, Turkey"},{"id":"EJ1063777","title":"A Meta-Synthesis of Empirical Research on the Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) in SLA","author":"Lin, Huifen","description":"This meta-analysis reports the results of a systematic synthesis of primary studies on the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in second language acquisition (SLA) for the period 2000-2012. By extracting information on 21 features from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for instructional\/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger groups or no grouping.

The means and modes of online communication and engagement, themselves powerful contributors to identity formation, are likewise in a constant state of flux. Participating in emerging online communities may require users to develop new skills, acquire specific software or hardware, and\/or learn particular conventions and behavior norms. In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities. Capability in a full range of digital literacies is key to that process and vital today in education, personal life, and work environments: The growing importance of online technologies for the ways in which we work and learn in global networks has meant that today, instead of using technology simply to learn FLs [foreign languages], learners need to learn how to combine both FL skills and &quot;e-skills&quot; or &quot;new literacies&quot; to be able to work and collaborate in new contexts where the borders between the visual and the real and between the distant and the proximate are increasingly blurred (Dooly &amp; O'Dowd, 2012, p. 15). That blurring of boundaries among literacies, genres, and modes of representation is what makes this topic intriguing and challenging.","subject":"Technological Literacy, Second Language Learning, Incidental Learning, Skill Development, Communities of Practice, Literacy, Second Language Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Role, Language Teachers, Learning Motivation, Personal Autonomy, Cultural Awareness, Work Environment, Information Literacy","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1063788","title":"Bridging the Communication Divide: CMC and Deaf Individuals' Literacy Skills","author":"Garberoglio, Carrie Lou, Dickson, Duncan, Cawthon, Stephanie, Bond, Mark","description":"Deaf individuals frequently capitalize upon communication technologies that increase equitable access to communication in an ongoing, effortless manner. Those communication technologies create conditions that increase direct access to language and literacy. It is the lack of direct access to language that has been historically problematic for deaf individuals, contributing to English literacy achievement gaps that are evidenced in deaf education settings. This study explored the hypothesis that increased access to English through communication technologies would be related to stronger English literacy skills for deaf individuals. A secondary analysis approach using a longitudinal large-scale dataset, the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), was used to assess the frequency of computer-mediated communication as a predictor of English literacy skills in a sample of 510 deaf youths in the United States. Regression analyses demonstrated that deaf adolescents who e-mailed or chatted more frequently exhibited higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These results suggest that communication technologies should be further explored as a potential avenue that may support deaf individuals' English language and literacy development.","subject":"Deafness, Communication Skills, Literacy, Reading Skills, Longitudinal Studies, Regression (Statistics), English, Computer Mediated Communication, Electronic Mail, Reading Comprehension, Language Acquisition, Surveys, Scores, Hearing Impairments, Statistical Analysis, Correlation, Individual Characteristics, Adolescents","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1051670","title":"Supporting In-Service Language Educators in Learning to Telecollaborate","author":"O'Dowd, Robert","description":"The importance of teachers' capacity to integrate and exploit computer mediated communication (CMC) in the foreign language classroom has been recognised by many of the leading publications in foreign language teacher education, including the European Profile for Language Teacher Education (2004) and the European portfolio for student teachers of foreign languages (EPOSTL) (2007). One of the essential CMC activities in foreign language education is undoubtedly telecollaboration. This is the application of online communication tools to connect classes of language learners in geographically distant locations with the aim of developing their foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative tasks and project work (O'Dowd, 2007). This paper begins by presenting a model of competences for the telecollaborative teacher, which has been developed and verified by this author (2013) using the Delphi technique. The paper then presents UNICollaboration (www.unicollaboration.eu), an online platform, which has been developed reflecting these competences and a sociocultural approach to teacher education. Following that, the findings of four qualitative case studies of novice telecollaborators are used to inform the design of tools and training courses for educators in this complex activity of online foreign language education.","subject":"Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Language Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Competencies, Delphi Technique, Teacher Education, Case Studies, Cooperative Learning, Technological Literacy, Teacher Attitudes, College Faculty, Interviews, Foreign Countries","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Argentina, California, Italy"},{"id":"EJ1051671","title":"Rethinking Transfer: Learning from CALL Teacher Education as Consequential Transition","author":"Chao, Chin-chi","description":"Behind CALL teacher education (CTE) there is an unproblematized consensus of transfer, which suggests a positivist and tool-centered view of learning gains that differs from the sociocultural focus of recent teacher education research. Drawing on Beach's (2003) conceptualization of transfer as &quot;consequential transition,&quot; this qualitative study seeks a cross-contextual understanding of language teacher learning with digital technology as the teachers in this study moved from a CTE course back to their own teaching contexts. Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching. These results challenge the view that transfer in CTE must be about using technology. It is suggested that a focus on critical reflection of technology use may encourage teachers to continue reflective engagement in the ever-changing and complicated digital learning and teaching context.","subject":"Language Teachers, Teacher Education Programs, Praxis, Theory Practice Relationship, Transfer of Training, Interviews, Followup Studies, Graduate Surveys, Technology Uses in Education, Achievement Gains, Sociocultural Patterns, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Educational Practices, Learning Experience, Multimedia Instruction, Multimedia Materials, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Inservice Teacher Education, Graduate Students, Comparative Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Transcripts (Written Records), Technological Literacy, Technology Education, Teaching Methods, Teaching Skills, Foreign Countries, Educational Technology, Qualitative Research, Computer Assisted Instruction","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"}]
