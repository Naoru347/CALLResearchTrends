However, the feasibility and effectiveness of online corpus consultation for learners at a basic level of L2 proficiency have been relatively unexplored. The current study of Japanese-L1 (first language) learners in an EFL (English as a foreign language) context (N = 117) addresses these gaps in research. A preliminary investigation (Experiment 1) examined EFL learners (n = 78) as they used the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA: Davies, 2008) to revise essays. Experiment 2 (n = 39) used a within-subjects comparison to determine whether participants attained greater accuracy in supplying the missing word in a gap-fill test when using an electronic dictionary or COCA. The survey results from the two experiments revealed that participants generally found using an online corpus difficult. In Experiment 2, a paired-samples t-test showed that participants, at an alpha of p = 0.05 two-tailed, were marginally better able to answer test questions when using the online corpus than they were when using an electronic dictionary, p = 0.030.

Applying multimodal analysis framed by ecological, dialogical and distributed (EDD) views (Zheng and Newgarden, forthcoming), we explored four English as a second language learners' verbalizations and avatar actions. Players learned to take skilled linguistic action as they coordinated recurrent WoW gameplay activities (questing, planning next moves, traveling, learning a skill, etc.). Frequent activities matched Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) speaking proficiency descriptors, used widely in L2 teaching and learning (L2TL), providing evidence that players engaged in the types of communicative activities interaction-oriented classroom approaches develop. However, in the WoW context, interactions were not planned, but emerged as players dynamically directed the course of play. Furthermore, modalities of avatar-embodiment and conversing over Skype allowed players to flexibly integrate language and actions to co-act toward game goals, discuss non-game topics during play, or demonstrate comprehension with avatar actions alone, an affordance for less verbal players. This research builds on previous work (Zheng, Newgarden &amp; Young, 2012) relating WoW's multiplayer activities and L2 learners' skilled linguistic actions. We refer to Chemero's (2009) model of the animal-environment system to explain how L2 learners develop abilities to take skilled linguistic action by acting on affordances in WoW.

This study examined two types of tasks: a conceptual task, which tested students' competence to draw a generalizable conclusion through a meaning-making process of corpus consultation; and a procedural task, which asked students to complete problem-solving activities strategically through corpus analysis. Two groups of three students were given the same tasks of corpus consultation but asked to complete the tasks either collaboratively or individually. The students' verbal and nonverbal behaviors during the task completion, pre-and post-interviews, and the instructor's observation notes were the main sources of data for analysis. The results of this study showed that collaboration has significantly different effects depending on the task types of corpus consultation. The collaborative group (CG) outperformed the individual group (IG) in the conceptual corpus consultation task, but the procedural task was more efficiently completed by the IG than the CG. The underperformance of the CG in the procedural task seemed to be partly attributable to the role of established intersubjectivity and the power inequality in the CG.

The study employed a pretest-posttest design with intact third- and fourth-semester classes for German as a foreign language at a US university.

These constructions were new to third-semester students, whereas fourth-semester students had been exposed to them in the previous semester. The results show that, whereas the DDL method and the traditional method were both effective and resulted in lexical and grammatical gains, DDL was more effective for teaching new collocations.

Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, screen shot data, and students' post-course interviews, it was found, firstly, that while a head and shoulders framing shot was favoured by the trainee teachers, there does not appear to be an optimal framing choice for desktop videoconferencing among the three framing types identified. Secondly, there was a loss between the number of gestures performed by the trainee teachers and those that were visible for the students. Thirdly, when trainee teachers were able to coordinate the audio and kinesic modalities, communicative gestures that were framed, and held long enough to be perceived by the learners, were more likely to be valuable for mutual comprehension.

Thus the notion that enhancement of communicative competence is intrinsically tied to personal interaction with native speakers means that the potential of communication technologies such as Skype is not fully appreciated.

However, it appears that further research needs to be undertaken to identify students' use of mobile devices and their attitudes towards them, especially in developing countries. To achieve this aim, three instruments, i.e. questionnaires (n = 345), in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 128), and non-participant observations (50 sessions), were employed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The results indicate that Iranian EFL students are generally positive about mobile learning and the use of mobile devices for learning EFL. The perceived benefits of mobile learning comprised opportunities for ubiquitous learning and access to the Internet, use of multimedia in the classroom, and portability. On the contrary, the findings suggest that students might be discouraged from the use of mobile devices due to several perceived impeding factors. The analysis of the data illustrated that Iranian EFL students mainly use mobile devices for non-academic purposes. The majority of students own smartphones and laptops and prefer to use tablet PCs, smartphones, and laptops for language learning. The findings of the observations suggest that even though some Iranian EFL teachers favor the use of mobile devices in the classroom, some of them prevent students from such use.

The data related to assessing their TPACK development are derived from an online meeting, reflective reports, and individual interviews. The results indicate that the teachers' TPACK grew due to increased awareness of the affordances and constraints of web conferencing technology in an MFL teaching environment.

The survey, called TPACK-EFL, aims to provide an assessment tool for preservice foreign language teachers that addresses subject-specific pedagogies and technologies. Using mixed methods approach, survey items were generated first using qualitative methods (e.g. expert interviews and document analysis). The content validity of the items was established through expert and preservice teacher reviews. The survey was then validated through two rounds of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the first with 174 preservice EFL teachers and the second with 204 preservice EFL teachers. The results of the first round indicated a five-factor structure: technological knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and a fifth factor that combined TCK, TPK, and TPACK items. After revising the survey, the second round of EFA results showed a seven-factor structure that was consistent with the TPACK framework. The final TPACK-EFL survey included a total of 39 items: 9 TK, 5 CK, 6 PK, 5 PCK, 3 TCK, 7 TPK, and 4 TPACK.

Among the various ways of collocation learning, the DDL (data-driven learning) approach encourages the independent learning of collocations and allows learners to directly use corpora and tools to search for proper collocations. There are several useful collocation tools (JustTheWord, COCA, Tango, Gutenberg Collocation Tool) available for English as a second language (ESL) learners. There are, however, very few Chinese collocation tools available for learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL), despite the increasing numbers of CFL learners within the past several years. To help CFL students and teachers efficiently search for proper collocates, this paper introduces a new web-based collocation retrieval tool, ICE (Intelligent Collocation Engine), which is based on a large part-of-speech-tagged Chinese news corpus. To determine if the new tool can facilitate the searching of collocations, this tool was tested by a group of CFL students to find proper collocates in a translation task. The results showed that the students who used the ICE tool could successfully found many proper Chinese collocates for a given noun. In addition, 12 in-service CFL teachers were also invited to evaluate the effectiveness of this collocation tool. These teachers indicated that they could find proper Chinese collocates easily with the help of ICE. The teachers also commented that they might use the collocation retrieval tool to prepare their teaching materials. Both findings of the experiment as well as the survey suggest that the new collocation retrieval tool can facilitate Chinese collocation teaching and learning, but the content and functions of this tool can be further enhanced.

Results suggest that the majority were comfortable with the tasks, although they could not complete all the tasks in the stipulated time, and certain tasks and features in Twitter caused difficulty for some students. The actual testing involved the 10 best candidates (based on their performance, when using Twitter) completing tasks (five scenarios similar to pilot analysis) with any two assigned note-taking applications, from a set of five. Participants were observed, video-recorded, and interviewed concurrently and retrospectively. They also completed perception-based questionnaires on the usability of the software. Data suggested that participants were comfortable opening accounts, typing in text, with general navigation, choosing photos, etc. A few features, such as web clipping and file uploading, caused problems for some participants.

Students were asked to practice speaking EFL through producing individual and interactive stories with a Web-based multimedia system. We aimed to investigate an effectiveness of applying individual and interactive storytelling on speaking skills and the potential effects of multimedia aids in storytelling to facilitate language learning. Furthermore, we explored the relationships between research variables of this study, such as speaking performance on individual and interactive storytelling, the number of animation representations, and the system actual usage, with learning achievement. Four main findings were found in this study. First, students who used the system for creating stories significantly outperformed students who did not use it on the post-test. This finding suggests that storytelling activity with support of the system was beneficial for improving speaking skills. Second, speaking performance and the number of animation representations significantly correlated with learning achievement. Students who performed well during learning activities usually studied diligently and scored higher on final test. Animations could help students remember vocabulary and practice speaking to describe their animated stories. Third, only the speaking performance on individual storytelling was found as the significant predictor of learning achievement. Students working individually on storytelling were independent; they were less distracted from others, and had more opportunity for practice. The last but not the least, most students expressed positive perceptions and attitude toward the system and learning activities. Based on these findings, we suggest that storytelling learning activities supported by the Web-based multimedia system and implementing them in EFL learning classroom can be beneficial for facilitating speaking skills.

Thirty-four Arab learners of English as a foreign language watched and listened to an animated story under any one of the following conditions: (1) annotations + captions + animation (ACA) and (2) annotations + transcripts+ animation (ATA). After viewing the story, the participants received a vocabulary posttest (i.e., L2 spelling) and posttest of translating Arabic words into the target language (L2 form recall). These tests were readministered five weeks after the treatment. The results revealed that the ACA and ATA groups performed significantly better on both L2 vocabulary spelling and L2 vocabulary recall in posttest and delayed test treatments than on L2 vocabulary spelling and recall in the pretest treatments. No significant difference was observed between the ACA and ATA groups in terms of vocabulary posttests. However, the ACA group slightly outscored the ATA group in the long-term L2 form recall tests (i.e., delayed tests).

However, initial analyses of the research materials indicated that, despite the support, the students were not fully able to see their role as designers for the future. Cultural-historical activity theory was used to examine the problem more closely.

The overall pedagogical goal of this spring 2014 project was to provide participants in different educational and institutional settings an opportunity to collaboratively explore and evaluate the affordances of technology tools in the design of joint learning tasks. This ethnographic case study triangulates questionnaires, telecollaboration logs, and computer-mediated communication data (blogs, emails) to examine the types of negotiation (personal, interactive, procedural) telecollaborative teams displayed at the project's micro levels (self, situated telecollaborative activity) and macro levels (institutional setting, political context). Findings indicate that one telecollaborative team, Global Team 2, effectively managed their learning as a group by making key decisions collectively about their work processes. The team's high number of procedural negotiation instances suggests a high degree of task-orientation, which may have aided their task completion. In contrast, the number of personal and interactive negotiation types was low.

Despite the pervasiveness of e-book reading studies in higher education, most studies show that students' reactions to e-books are often negative. However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms. The different results may be due to different reading purposes. In addition, limited studies have investigated whether students' perceptions of e-books change over time since many of the e-book reading studies used a survey, rather than longitudinal, approach. Thus, this study intended to determine (1) English as a foreign language (EFL) college students' perceptions of e-books when they read for the purpose of responding to literature rather than for the purpose of intensively studying in an academic context; and (2) whether these perceptions change over time as based on a qualitative perspective. Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books. However, the e-book reading experience was still considered unpleasant to most of the participants in this study. This implies that the reading purpose may not have a great influence on students' perception of e-books. Despite the overall negative perceptions of e-books, the students also demonstrated some improved attitudes toward reading e-books for an entire semester. The findings indicate that when students are given time and opportunities to read e-books, they are likely to develop e-book reading habits and strategies.

Efforts to develop spell checkers specifically for L2 learners have focused on training software to offer more appropriate suggestion lists for replacing misspellings, but research suggests that students often select the wrong word from such lists. Moreover, since their spelling errors are often competence errors arising from misconceptions about the target language, students might benefit from feedback that addresses the underlying problem rather than simply suggesting the correct word. This article describes the use of a corpus of learner English to identify common misspellings produced by Spanish learners of English. For each of these errors, hand-crafted feedback has been written explaining how the correct spelling is consistent with the orthography or morphology of English. This material has been incorporated into a prototype spell checker for learners of English. Meanwhile, the software simply flags other errors as &quot;not amongst the 90,000 commonest words of English&quot;. Because it also detects unusual bigrams (word pairs), the program finds more spelling errors than generic spell checkers and additionally detects some non-spelling errors.

The particular contribution of this study is twofold: to offer insight into patterns that characterize the literacy practices that emerge through the introduction of telecollaboration into the learning environment and to document the types of pedagogical decision-making that such projects introduce into the secondary context. Using a case-study design, we explored two central areas: (1) What patterns of interaction emerge in the literacy practices of adolescent students as they build relationships with their intercultural partners? (2) How do teachers address the pedagogical issues that are foregrounded when introducing innovative literacy practices such as telecollaboration into the secondary learning environment? Our premise is that online exchanges might offer a different kind of learning experience that provides opportunities for adolescents to engage with language in ways that do not typically get enacted in conventional language classrooms. Our interest therefore is grounded both in providing a rich, descriptive inventory of how adolescents engage with telecollaboration in the classroom context, as well as in documenting the types of pedagogical issues that are introduced. We offer a linguistically grounded portrait of what constitutes the interactional patterns and pedagogical issues in a classroom learning environment shaped by the introduction of an online intercultural project.

Social constructivist principles underpin TWP, which was designed to engender collaboration amongst its student participants. Not only does TWP provide links to evaluated Internet resources and a writing portfolio, but it also features collaboration tools such as the Group Forum, chat, a writing portfolio, a private messaging system, and a comment function for pages or articles created. Thus, it is very much akin to a &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for academic writing within a flexible and supportive environment. In this qualitative case study, 16 third-year TESL pre-service teachers at a Malaysian Teacher Education Institute embarked on a 12-week writing course using TWP. Qualitative data in the form of students' online discourses, task reflections, log files, and digital artefacts were captured to explore how TWP's affordances supported students' writing needs. In addition, Soller's collaborative learning conversation skills (CLCS) taxonomy was used as an analytical framework to investigate the collaborative learning engendered in the online environment. The findings indicate that TWP served its purpose by addressing students' writing needs at all stages of the writing process as they accomplished multiple writing tasks. Additionally, evidence of collaborative learning is evident in three functions of TWP: the Group Forum, chat, and the comments for pages/articles.

This study interviews 20 experienced online language tutors and 20 adult students about their attitudes towards webcams and their use of webcams. The findings suggest that most teachers and students only used webcams at the start of their lessons for socio-affective reasons and discontinued the use of webcams after the first 2-3 weeks. Some common reasons for reducing the use of webcams were the perception of &quot;webcamming&quot; as a more tiring mode, the feeling of self-consciousness and privacy concerns.

However, studies framed in terms of concordancing often overlook potentially significant differences in concordancing conditions by treating concordances as a simple, unidimensional construct. This study identifies variables within concordancing that may provide learners with diverging affordances, affordances that are not mutually compatible, and explores concordancing through a survey of concordance users' preferences. The data is analysed through a series of factor analyses which indicate that concordancing is a complex, multidimensional construct. It finds that there are at least four factors underlying the construct of concordancing: how citations are formatted, the type of corpus used, the order citations are presented in, and the task engaged in. Each of these factors represents a dimension of variance amongst concordance users. If it is safe to assume that concordance users' preferences are unlikely to be arbitrary, and are likely to indicate the affordances of concordancing in a particular configuration, then each factor represents a potentially significant variable in learner use of concordances.

Based on the situational analysis, we make a quick diagnosis of the state in which health education stands, in order to find a starting point for the improvement. We conducted 15 depth interviews with Romanian and Spanish students in 3 teaching centers of the South of Spain. The qualitative analysis of data was carried out using Atlas Ti, version 7. The results show that participants do not consider schools as the main source of health learning, while family, peers and technologies are seen as more significant agents. In secondary schools, most of the information related to health is received through outside educational programs, and it is seen as ineffective because they are partial, merely informative and not continuous over time. The main health problems in secondary schools identified were stress and bullying, and we may consider as relevant the existence of discrimination based on origin or precedence. Furthermore, participants provide an essentialized, stereotyped and inferior vision of health in other foreign continents (Africa) and religions (Islam).

The data center will create a private cloud to engage faculty and students in a highly accessible, experimental cloud environment, where through real-world experience faculty can teach and students can learn the design, configuration, deployment, management, and use of cloud solutions. This polytechnic approach in cloud curriculum integration will also allow the IS department to be simulated as a modern enterprise with a goal to virtualize its IT provisioning, where students can gain a broader, more enterprise-centric view of modern computing.", "subject": "Information Systems, Computer Science Education, College Curriculum, Experiential Learning, Computer Centers, College Students", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "California"}, {"id": "EJ1100085", "title": "Impacts of Flipped Classroom in High School Health Education", "author": "Chen, Li-Ling", "description": "As advanced technology increasingly infiltrated into classroom, the flipped classroom has come to light in secondary educational settings.

Research on Internet addiction, initiated by Kimberly Young at the end of the twentieth century, usually appears in the literature in the context of young people who have been found to be most vulnerable. The phenomenon is known as Adolescent Internet Addiction. Compulsive use of the Internet is a complex phenomenon, its effects being visible in almost all aspects of a young person's social life. It is manifested in a variety of pathological behaviors and emotional states grouped into several major psycho-physical and social effects that may appear simultaneously, e.g. anger, depression, loneliness or anxiety associated with the lack of access to the network, the weakening of social ties, withdrawal from real life, lack of educational achievement, chronic fatigue or deteriorating health. The authors of this study aim to assess the level of Internet addiction among adolescents in Poland and indicate its main behavioral manifestations, in the students surveyed, which influence their pathological use of the Internet. Our study involved a total of 505 students from three high schools located in Rzeszow (N = 505) and was carried out by questionnaires, including, among others, The Problematic Use of the Internet (PUI) which is the Polish adaptation of Kimberly Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) (Cronbach's a = 0.89). Statistical analysis of responses from the PUI test allowed us to determine (1) the level of Internet addiction among these adolescents, whereas the univariate (ANOVA) analysis enabled us (2) to verify the hypothesis of the existence of differences in the level of Internet addiction among the investigated groups as far as gender, place of residence or grade are concerned. Generally, the results obtained in our research indicate that the level of Internet addiction among the adolescents investigated is not very high, although two thirds of our respondents showed an above average level of addiction, and every ninth respondent (approximately 11%) was highly addicted to the Internet, men being more often addicted (15.6%) than women (8.3%).", "subject": "Foreign Countries, Internet, Social Media, Addictive Behavior, Adolescents, Adolescent Attitudes, Questionnaires, Access to Computers, Use Studies, Time on Task, Computer Use, Handheld Devices, Computer Mediated Communication, Information Seeking, High School Students, Student Attitudes, Measures (Individuals), Statistical Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Gender Differences, Pathology", "source": "Practice and Theory in Systems of Education", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": "Poland"}, {"id": "EJ1135341", "title": "Streamlining the Capstone Process: A Time-Saving Approval System for Graduate Theses/Projects", "author": "Grooms, James, Kline, Douglas, Cummings, Jeffrey", "description": "Capstones have become an integral part of many information systems programs, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.

However, the current literature on emergency online schools suggests that fully functioning emergency online schools are possible only through thoughtful planning and development before a disaster strikes. As a result, this article addresses the prospect of rapid development of emergency online schools in situations when schools are closed or inaccessible for a long period of time due to a disaster or other emergency, and there is no emergency online or other alternative school plan currently in place. We posit herein that although a fully functioning emergency online school is likely possible only through thoughtful planning and development, some of the key virtues of emergency online schools are, nevertheless, attainable after a disaster or other emergency necessitates complete school closure. We offer a plan for &quot;rapid&quot; establishment of an emergency online school as a &quot;response&quot; to a disaster &quot;after&quot; a disaster has happened and when complete school closure or inaccessibility was not anticipated as part of the current school crisis response plan and a comprehensive emergency online school plan is not yet established.

Students are taught to cite everything, while instructors are given tools to detect plagiarism.

At the same time, technical writers create, reuse, remix, and remarket content on a regular basis in the form of instruction manuals, boilerplates, and other technical, factual, straightforward texts. In academia, the technical writer would be accused of (self-) plagiarism, which would not--given the context--be the case. In the professional world, where the majority of writing will be technical, students will find themselves creating content based on already-existing texts, a direct contradiction of their academic training. This teaching case asks students to consider not only plagiarism but also the concepts of copying and remixing, two ideas closely related to plagiarism, and develop their own conclusions, both personal and professional, about what is and is not ethical communication.

To achieve this aim, CALL employs technological innovations to create novel types of language practice. Evaluations of the new practice types serve the important role of distinguishing effective practice environments from less effective environments, while simultaneously informing educational practices and second language acquisition (SLA) theory. Accordingly, evaluations of CALL systems necessarily deal with multiple criteria. Most researchers would probably agree that motivation is an important criterion in CALL evaluations: a system can provide sufficient L2 input and opportunities for L2 output, yet fail to be pedagogically effective if learners are unwilling to participate. Furthermore, knowledge of the motivational impact of practice can provide valuable context linking individual language learners, practice effort and learning outcomes. From the perspective of recent theoretical developments in L2 motivation theory, this paper surveys a representative sample of CALL system evaluations that include motivational impact. Our analysis suggests not only that CALL needs to do more to align its treatment of motivation with recent L2 motivation theories, but also that it is well positioned to do so. We find that: (1) few CALL studies treat motivation as it relates to practice as a dynamic variable; (2) behavioural practice logs are underexploited; and (3) very few evaluations take into account learners' individual interests and goals. Drawing on these and other findings, we suggest four new directions for developing the motivation dimension in CALL evaluations.", "subject": "Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Student Motivation, Program Evaluation, Predictor Variables, Student Behavior, Student Interests, Goal Orientation, Computer Assisted Instruction, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1100937", "title": "Language Views on Social Networking Sites for Language Learning: The Case of Busuu", "author": "\u00c1lvarez Valencia, Jos\u00e9 Aldemar", "description": "Social networking has compelled the area of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) to expand its research palette and account for new virtual ecologies that afford language learning and socialization.

One aspect of this phenomenon namely, use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), has expanded significantly, highlighting the need for a review. This paper analyzes findings from 10 learner-based studies that draw on accounts of SLA informed by cognitive and sociocultural theories. Analysis reveals that research conducted from the sociocultural perspective provides evidence of constructs identified as playing a central role in SLA. Analysis indicates that playing MMORPGs elicits target language dialogue involving collaboration, assistance and co-construction. Data show that MMORPGs provide access to conditions conducive to the operation of zones of proximal development. Findings show that this type of game provides access to both in-game and extramural communities of practice that facilitate language socialization. Research undertaken from a cognitive perspective shows that participation in MMORPG-based gaming facilitates production of the target language. However, this work does not provide conclusive evidence that game play elicits forms of interaction such as negotiation, that are hypothesized as playing a central role in learning in the cognitive account of SLA. Studies conducted from both perspectives draw attention to positive learner attitudes indicating high levels of motivation. The analysis reveals that although studies are subject to limitations, they have produced promising results.

However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress.

Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning. This study provides empirical data that help to better understand how corpus tools contribute to EFL writing.", "subject": "Dictionaries, Indexes, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computational Linguistics, Nonmajors, Writing (Composition), Phrase Structure, Recall (Psychology), Bilingualism, Monolingualism, Video Technology, Grammar, Definitions, Intuition, Writing Processes, College Students, Writing Instruction, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Observation, Foreign Countries, Questionnaires", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1059267", "title": "Blogs and the Development of Plurilingual and Intercultural Competence: Report of a Co-Actional Approach in Portuguese Foreign Language Classroom", "author": "Melo-Pfeifer, S\u00edlvia", "description": "Focusing on the topic of the development of the plurilingual and intercultural competence through the integration of electronic communicative practices both in foreign language classrooms and non-formal contexts, this work aims at defining and characterizing, in view of a co-actional perspective, a &quot;pedagogical blog&quot;, by considering it from three different axes: a personal and social dimension, a collaborative and co-actional dimension and the management of linguistic and cultural repertoires dimension.

This study adopted Kintsch's Construction-Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels.

To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness.

However, they often require a significant amount of additional effort beyond that required of assigning conventional homework problems. When the projects take place in an online course setting, the level of complexity subsequently increases. Valuing the overall contribution of such projects, in light of their additional instructor and course costs, can be difficult. Such valuations are further complicated with the measures being subjective. In 1992, Drs. Robert Kaplan and David Norton published an article in Harvard Business Review detailing a model for measuring the effect of multiple perspectives, both financial and subjective, on business performance (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992). The Balanced Scorecard approach provides both an internal (process based) and external (outcomes based) standpoint to evaluating an organization utilizing four perspectives: (1) Learning and Growth, (2) Business Process, (3) Customer and (4) Financial (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1996). With its thorough approach to evaluating objective and subjective measures of business performance, the model serves as a potential framework for use in the educational setting.

The quality perspective presented is more expansive than that usually found in software engineering, the traditional &quot;objective&quot; notion of metrics, and integrates aspects of aesthetics, the more subjective phenomena of satisfaction. This learning unit is intended as an adaptable framework to be tailored to the coursework and the overall objectives of specific IS programs.", "subject": "Units of Study, Design, Computer Software, Models, Systems Development, Satisfaction, Aesthetics, College Curriculum, Information Systems, Computer Science Education", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1137147", "title": "Empowering Freshmen with Technology Skills: Wireless Routers", "author": "VanderClock, William", "description": "Most freshmen taking required, introductory information systems courses do not understand why they are required to take such courses and can't imagine that they will learn anything they don't already know.

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search.

Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching.

Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges.

In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities.

One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility.

They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data.

Forty-two elementary French students participated in an experimental study in which they were assigned to one of three groups: (1) the ASR Group, which used an ASR application on their mobile devices to complete weekly pronunciation activities, with immediate written visual (textual) feedback provided by the software and no human interaction; (2) the Non-ASR Group, which completed the same weekly pronunciation activities in individual weekly sessions but with a teacher who provided immediate oral feedback using recasts and repetitions; and finally, (3) the Control Group, which participated in weekly individual meetings 'to practice their conversation skills' with a teacher who provided no pronunciation feedback. The study followed a pretest/posttest design. According to the results of the dependent samples t-tests, only the ASR group improved significantly from pretest to posttest (p &lt; 0.001), and none of the groups improved in perception.

While social presence has mostly been investigated through questionnaire data and quantitative content analysis of online interactions based on a set of predefined indicators, in a smaller number of studies the concept has also been investigated through qualitative analysis of interviews (Kehrwald, 2008, 2010). Yet studies that bring together multiple sources of data collection and examine multimodal language learning contexts are almost non-existent. In this paper, the theory of social presence is employed to explicate language learners' online multimodal communication using a case study approach. Multiple sources of data were collected, including interviews, open-ended and closed post-task questionnaires, stimulated reflection and recordings of video interactions. The main findings of the study included an innovative social presence framework developed for the analysis of online multimodal language learner interactions (Satar, 2010), which can be used in further qualitative and exploratory research. It also has potential applicability for educators to develop strategies for language learners to guide them in creating and transmitting their social presence. The focus of this article is a cross-case analysis for one of the components of social presence, sustaining interaction, bringing together social presence theory, interactional sociolinguistics and multimodal interaction analysis.

It is argued that qualitative methods are especially effective when used in this way. The discussion also aims to elaborate upon the role of qualitative approaches within CALL specifically, as a domain for research study with particular attributes that require a qualitative orientation. Here the use of electronic dictionaries is considered. Dictionary use is suited to such a discussion because it occurs frequently in everyday life, suggesting a qualitative approach, as well as in research studies that are strictly controlled, as in a quantitative approach. The contrast is instructive and helps demonstrate the respective strengths and limitations of each method. Also central to the discussion is the language learner. A number of the studies described emphasize the importance of listening to the students' voice in the qualitative component (e.g., Conole, 2008; Jones, 2003).

ESL teachers intending to analyse English language subject textbooks written for secondary school students with the aim of gaining information about what bilingual secondary school students need to know in terms of language to process academic textbooks cannot avoiding deal with a dilemma. It needs to be decided which way it is most appropriate to analyse the texts in question. Handbooks of English applied linguistics are not immensely helpful with regard to this problem as they tend not to give recommendation as to which major text analytical approaches are advisable to follow in a pre-college setting. The present theoretical research aims to address this lacuna. Respectively, the purpose of this pedagogically motivated theoretical paper is to investigate two major approaches of ESP text analysis, the register and the genre analysis, in order to find the more suitable one for exploring the language use of secondary school subject texts from the point of view of an English as a second language teacher. Comparing and contrasting the merits and limitations of the two contrastive approaches allows for a better understanding of the nature of the two different perspectives of text analysis. The study examines the goals, the scope of analysis, and the achievements of the register perspective and those of the genre approach alike. The paper also investigates and reviews in detail the starkly different methods of ESP text analysis applied by the two perspectives. Discovering text analysis from a theoretical and methodological angle supports a practical aspect of English teaching, namely making an informed choice when setting out to analyse texts in English. It can be concluded from the literature that the register perspective yields more readily applicable data of text analysis for ESL teachers instructing in a pre-college environment.

This study suggests that the adoption of Facebook is a new, innovative, and practical way to facilitate effective intercultural interactions as well as promote IC in the EFL classroom.", "subject": "Social Networks, Technology Uses in Education, Intercultural Communication, Cultural Awareness, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Foreign Countries, College Students, Telecommunications, Intercultural Programs, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Participant Observation, Ethnography, Qualitative Research, Interviews, Content Analysis", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2015, "identifiersgeo": "South Korea, United States"}, {"id": "EJ1075831", "title": "The Intersection of Multimodality and Critical Perspective: Multimodality as Subversion", "author": "Huang, Shin-ying", "description": "This study explores the relevance of multimodality to critical media literacy.

Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information.

They were divided into four treatment groups: (1) high-proficiency students receiving L1 gloss before L2 gloss (n = 19), (2) high-proficiency students receiving L2 gloss before L1 gloss (n = 19), (3) low-proficiency students receiving L1 gloss before L2 gloss (n = 20), and (4) low-proficiency students receiving L2 gloss before L1 gloss (n = 20). After reading, the students were assessed with a vocabulary test which contained a definition-supply part and a cloze part serving as both post-tests and delayed post-tests. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were utilized to analyze the score data. Significant differences were found not only among the four groups but also between the two post-tests. Overall the high proficiency groups performed better in the post-tests, but the high proficiency group who received English glosses remembered more words in the delayed post-test than the high proficiency group who received Chinese glosses. The results show that as learners&apos; proficiency increases, they may be able to make better use of the L2 conceptual links for word retention and learning. The conclusions support the usefulness of both Chinese and English e-glosses which should be selected based on learners&apos; proficiency level.", "subject": "Junior High School Students, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Incidental Learning, Vocabulary Development, Computer Assisted Instruction, Chinese, Instructional Effectiveness, Teaching Methods, Language Proficiency, Cloze Procedure, Language Tests, Scores, Reading Processes", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1038171", "title": "The Effects of Paper-Based DDL on the Acquisition of Lexico-Grammatical Patterns in L2 Writing", "author": "Huang, Zeping", "description": "This paper examines whether and to what extent data-driven learning (DDL) activities can improve the lexico-grammatical use of abstract nouns in L2 writing.

The findings of this study are based on content analyses of the teachers' interview transcripts, the teachers' observation of college students' progress in on-site and online instruction, and the interactions among the students recorded in the log files of the online system. The results show that the language teachers' problems in blended teaching of summary writing fell into three categories: instructional processes, community concerns, and technical issues. The four main themes that emerged from the three categories include the following: (1) the changing roles of the teachers and students, (2) little sense of community building, (3) lack of training in blended teaching of summary writing, and (4) an unfamiliarity with the new systems or technologies. The language teachers' perspectives on solving these problems were to (1) distinguish the significant differences between on-site and online language teaching contexts, (2) identify strategies and techniques to facilitate students' blended learning in summary writing, and (3) develop community building skills to encourage teachers and students to actively participate in collaborative learning. These solutions shed light on the preparation of language teachers in blended teaching of summary writing.", "subject": "Writing Skills, Language Teachers, Blended Learning, Teaching Methods, Teacher Education, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Computer Assisted Instruction, Online Courses, College Students, Interaction, Student Role, Teacher Role, Teacher Attitudes, Teacher Student Relationship, Communities of Practice, Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), College Faculty, Writing Instruction", "source": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "Taiwan"}, {"id": "EJ1025556", "title": "Building Course Cohesion: The Use of Online Forums in Distance Chinese Language Learning", "author": "Qian, Kan, McCormick, Robert", "description": "This paper examines a sample of online discussion data from the course forum for the large-scale beginners' Chinese course offered by the UK Open University.

Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction, examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use.

However, are these curricular decisions supported by research? Overall, a cursory review of empirical studies appears to provide strong support for the use of CALL. Studies claim that technology can successfully promote learning in several areas of L2 acquisition, including grammar, and that it can even outperform FTF instruction in some cases. However, the methodological validity of this body of research has never been thoroughly assessed and, consequently, we ignore how much confidence we can place in its results. To address this, the present study analyzes the internal and external validity of 16 recent developmental studies. Based on this analysis, we conclude that at this point no strong argument can be made about whether or not the medium matters in L2 development, until further empirical studies with more robust research designs fully address the comparative effects of CALL vs. FTF instruction, including the role of some possibly intervening variables such as task type, time-on-task, or modality.

The focus was on evidence-based pedagogies including: (1) authentic learning by applying &quot;Pedagogy 2.0&quot; tasks and social media (2) the adoption of scaffolded pedagogy by the instructor to achieve learning outcomes. The methodology used was qualitative, based on teacher pedagogical tasks and activities designed for students in order to establish the success of the types of scaffolding offered and student perceptions of their effectiveness in promoting collaboration and learning. The research demonstrates that technological innovations which are accompanied by pedagogical scaffolding promote effective teaching of social informatics. The research concludes that while web 2.0 tools can enable engaged, self-regulated learning, students may not always be familiar with the tools or cognitive strategies to support their learning processes. Digital tools such as Twitter and blogs were found to engage students' in real-world activities to learn key concepts, and that task scaffolding was an effective pedagogical approach.", "subject": "Case Studies, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Web 2.0 Technologies, Information Science, Information Science Education, Electronic Learning, Constructivism (Learning), College Instruction, Qualitative Research, Instructional Effectiveness, Graduate Students, Undergraduate Students, Student Attitudes, Foreign Countries", "source": "Journal of Information Systems Education", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "Australia"}, {"id": "EJ1125958", "title": "Competence-Based System Self-Study System for Suggesting Study Materials Links", "author": "Nitchot, Athitaya, Gilbert, Lester, Wills, Gary B.", "description": "The article proposes a self-study system which suggests web links to learners.

Findings: The authors' conceptualisation of this cloud-based environment is also very much aligned with the development of pre-service teachers' systems thinking. Teacher learning itself is a complex system that involves many processes, mechanisms and interactions of elements, and the outcomes may be highly unpredictable (Opfer and Pedder, 2011). As a result of the complex nature of teacher learning, it would be meaningful to frame teacher learning as a complex system. An approach to enable pre-service teachers to be aware of this complexity is to situate them in a systems thinking context.

Based on the premise of Task-Technology Fit Theory, this study suggests that the effectiveness of student learning in online courses depends on the alignment between two. Furthermore, it conceptualizes the formation of such a fit through the lens of Media Synchronicity Theory: each type of learning task in the online environment requires a certain level of media synchronicity, and various e-learning tools enable different levels of media synchronicity. Their alignment forms along two dimensions of media synchronicity: the purpose dimension ranging from conveyance to convergence and the process dimension ranging from asynchronous to synchronous. The conceptualization leads to research hypotheses that posit the aligned relationships between learning tasks and e-learning tools in terms of purpose and process. The hypotheses were tested with the observations collected from an experiment, and the conjoint analysis results support that students do perceive and prefer the fit between learning tasks and e-learning tools along the two dimensions.

The purpose of this paper is to report on a pilot project that developed a customisable education programme to support Indigenous communities in the uptake of spatial mapping technologies to protect and manage cultural heritage in Victoria, Australia. Design/methodology/approach: A training programme to support Wadawurrung capabilities in spatial mapping technologies was developed, delivered and evaluated. Concurrently, the system's database was indigenised by Wadawurrung cultural heritage workers. Types and numbers of culturally significant sites mapped using the technologies were collated. The impact of the training and technologies for students and the Wadawurrung community was gauged through participation levels and evaluations. The approach to indigenous spatial mapping projects is informed by postcolonial theories interrogating neo-colonialist cartographic practices. Findings: Indigenous communities need to be resourced in the uptake of spatial mapping technologies and if universities are going to be involved in co-developing positive learning experiences that encourage the uptake of the technologies, they must have appropriate and respectful relationships with Aboriginal communities. Training programmes need to accommodate learners with diverse educational experiences and technological wherewithal. Research limitations/implications: Findings from the training evaluations are based on a small number of participants; however, they seem to be supported by literature.

As evident from the literature review, most of these implementations are happening in the western countries such as USA, UK, while the level of implementation of CC in developing countries such as India is rare. Moreover, implementing CC technology in the educational sector require various decisions to be made by the managers of the Information Technology (IT) department such as selecting suitable deployment model, vendor providing cloud service, etc. in their respective university or institute. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to address one such decision. Since, different types of CC deployment are available; selecting a suitable one plays a key role, as it might have an impact on the requirements of various stakeholders such as students, teachers, administrative staff (especially the staff members in the IT department), etc. apart from affecting the overall performance of the facilities such as a laboratory. Naturally, a proper decision by analysing multiple perspectives has to be made while carrying out such strategic initiatives by any educational institute. Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology has been chosen as the research methodology to discuss and demonstrate the above decision problem that was faced in real time by one of the educational institutes in India, offering high-quality management education. The IT managers of this institute were planning to switch over to CC technology for the computer laboratory and they have to make a decision of choosing suitable alternative CC deployment models such as private cloud (PRC), public cloud (PUC), community cloud (COC), hybrid cloud (HYC), etc. by analysing and comparing them based on various factors and perspectives such as elasticity, availability, scalability, etc. Since, multiple factors are involved in making such a strategic decision, the most commonly used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model--namely, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a decision support during the decision making process. Findings: The team of decision makers, who were planning to implement CC in the case institute, found that PRC is best as they believed that it would provide adequate cost savings, apart from providing necessary security to maintain confidential information such as student's detail, grades, etc. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained are based on a single case study. Hence, they cannot be generalized for institutions across educational sector. However, the decision making situation and understanding its impact on the stakeholders of the educational institute can be common across various educational institute. Practical implications: Using a real-life case study of an educational institute, this paper presented a strategic decision making situation, which needs to be considered by the IT managers of the educational institutes when they decide to switch over to CC technology. Various criteria to be considered during the decision making process was identified from the literature review were identified and enumerated. These factors would useful for the IT managers of the different educational institute and they can suitably add or delete these decision criteria as per their requirements and situation at hand. Moreover, the algorithm of AHP, which was used as a decision support, was presented in a step-by-step manner, which should be beneficial for the practitioners to apply the same for similar decision making situations. Originality/value: It is believed that this paper would be the first to report on a strategic decision of choosing the deployment model for CC technology especially in the educational sector. Similarly, this paper would also contribute to the field of CC, as it lists out the decision criteria that are to be considered for making the above decision, which has not got adequate importance. Lastly, this paper is also unique in the realm of AHP because application for a decision problem in the field of CC especially in the educational sector is least reported.", "subject": "Internet, Computer Software, Information Management, Information Storage, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Technology Integration, Case Studies, Foreign Countries, Decision Making, Strategic Planning, Higher Education", "source": "Campus-Wide Information Systems", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "India"}, {"id": "EJ1140738", "title": "Swipe In, Tap Out: Advancing Student Entrepreneurship in the CIS Sandbox", "author": "Charlebois, Conner, Hentschel, Nicholas, Frydenberg, Mark", "description": "The Computer Information Systems Learning and Technology Sandbox (CIS Sandbox) opened as a collaborative learning lab during the fall 2011 semester at a New England business university.

This approach allows students from different disciplines to collaborate in a distributed computing environment in order to learn important information security principles. Two case studies simulating real-life scenarios, including one for an online banking system and one for an online grading system, are recreated within a laboratory setting using workflow technology and are then presented in information security classes.

This novel instructional method was implemented to teach the fundamentals of Microsoft Office and Google Sites as part of a required freshman undergraduate Computer Information Systems class. Effectiveness was evaluated at the end of the semester (N = 72). Results support the efficacy of screencasts over traditional lectures for step-by-step instruction. To maximize effectiveness, students should follow along with the screencasts during class time. Moreover, professors should consider interspersing screencasts with collaborative group work. Also, professors should ensure that the screencasts have an adequate level of difficulty for the students. Moreover, students should be encouraged to follow the screencast in real time, possibly by dividing the computer screen between the screencast and their workspace.

In the spirit of &quot;the first among equals,&quot; we posit that design should have preeminence in the education of information systems professionals. Design frames problem understanding and defines what system's quality means. It behooves our profession to prepare designers who deliver systems that not only &quot;work,&quot; but also deliver systems that society will recognize as &quot;working well.&quot; The research community recognizes this as reflected in a renewed interest in design science research and in information systems design theory. While our discipline has been recently reshaped by offshoring, outsourcing, and service-oriented architectures, which provide myriad options for managing information in organizations, design persists as a central aspect of the discipline. This is so as information systems design remains close to stakeholders because design materializes an organization's core business model and strategy. This paper contemplates a design-focused IS curriculum and postulates a perspective on design that values the subjective sensibilities of stakeholders as well as an objective, algorithmic depiction of computing. The latter has shaped the classic education of a developer as a master of technology while the former nurtures an aesthetic awareness that captures nuances of stakeholder satisfaction and a more inclusive conception of system quality.

However, this process of identity negotiation was complicated by gaps in their pragmatic competence, their preexisting identities and differing expectations on the part of Korean interlocutors.

Twenty-two college students enrolled in second year Spanish in a technology-enhanced classroom participated in the study. Two types of medium of delivery of input were compared: mobile assisted language learning (MALL), which is learner manipulated, and instructor manipulated language learning (IMLL). A quasi-experimental design was used -- treatment and immediate tests -- in order to measure participants&apos; reported noticing and type of comprehension. Noticing was operationalized using think-aloud protocols, and measured on the post-test exposure comprehension assessment tasks. The findings of the study, interpreted within the attentional SLA framework, indicate that learners in the MALL group demonstrated significantly higher levels of reported noticing, bottom-up comprehension, and top-down overall comprehension than learners in the IMLL group.

Qualitative analyses of answers and think-aloud protocols identified generally-used strategies both with and without the pop-up dictionary: engaging in bottom-up strategies, monitoring comprehension, using the first language, and focusing on lexical cues. Qualitative analyses also revealed different reading strategies in obtaining character and word meanings and in constructing sentence meanings. Statistical results indicated that much of the improvement gained from using the pop-up dictionary during the first reading was not retained over a short period of time.

Institutional factors likewise played an important part in the subsequent incorporation of MALL into the curriculum, with the encouragement of the administration, financial support and technological infrastructure being the most positive in this regard. On the other hand, the lack of financial and technological support was deemed to constitute a substantial negative factor. Likewise, when it existed, curricular flexibility played a major positive role in making MALL integration possible, whereas the absence of curricular flexibility was considered a significant negative impediment.

Foreign-born nurses report that while they may feel clinically competent, they often feel unprepared for the use of English in the healthcare setting (Davis &amp; Nichols, 2002; Guttman, 2004). Immigrant health professionals experience communication difficulties with patients and coworkers that are easily exacerbated in a healthcare setting where situations can quickly become emotionally charged and stressful. Their U.S.-born peers identify a number of difficulties in working with foreign-born nurses, including lack of communication skills and differences in decision making, behavioral norms, role expectations, and attitudes (Yi &amp; Jezewski, 2000). Patients may express distress at being unable to understand physicians who are not native English speakers, and, whether their complaints reflect prejudices or not, they are undermining for the immigrant practitioner (McMahon, 2004). To address the need of foreign-born nurses for continued language and cultural support, the authors of this article developed and evaluated the first phase of a multimedia, Internet-based educational tool, the Intercultural Communication Workshop (ICW), designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign-born nurses. Participants in the ICW learn a three-fold set of rules for improving their speech intelligibility: consonant clarity, vowel accuracy, and appropriate intonation (Sikorski, 2005a). Instruction in the ICW is tailored to the healthcare workplace whenever possible and includes contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the United States, thereby avoiding the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to second language instruction. The Intercultural Communication Workshop is designed as a supplement to formal in-person instruction and orientation programs. When such programs are lacking, this e-learning course can stand alone as self-paced instruction.

The gap between high-income and low-income countries, meanwhile, is decreasing at a much slower pace. At the same time, the gap between middle-income and low-income countries is actually widening. Indeed, in the early 1980s GDP per capita in the low-income countries was on average three times lower than in the middle-income countries, and this gap was totally overshadowed by the more than ten-time abyss between the middle-income and the high-income countries. Now, however, the GDP per capita in low-income countries lags behind the middle-income ones by more than five times, which is largely the same as the gap (rapidly contracting in the recent years) between the high-income and the middle-income countries. This clearly suggests that the configuration of the world system has experienced a very significant transformation in the recent 30 years. Research limitations/implications: The research concentrates upon the dynamics of the gap in per capita income between the high-income, the middle-income, and the low-income countries. Originality/value: This paper's originality/value lies in drawing attention to the specific changes in the structure of global convergence/divergence patterns and their implications for the low-income countries.", "subject": "Economics, Global Approach, Systems Approach, Income, Economic Development, Change", "source": "Campus-Wide Information Systems", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1037264", "title": "Tongue Control and Its Implication in Pronunciation Training", "author": "Ouni, Slim", "description": "Pronunciation training based on speech production techniques illustrating tongue movements is gaining popularity.

We investigated human awareness of controlling their tongue body gestures. In a first experiment, participants were asked to perform some tongue movements composed of two sets of gestures. This task was evaluated by observing ultrasound imaging of the tongue recorded during the experiment. No feedback was provided. In a second experiment, a short session of training was added where participants can observe ultrasound imaging in real time of their own tongue movements. The goal was to increase their awareness of their tongue gestures. A pretest and posttest were carried out without any feedback. The results suggest that without a priori knowledge, it is not easy to finely control tongue body gestures.

In addition, the study assesses the effects of satisfaction on expectation in the context of English learning and employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the hypotheses. The results were based on a sample of 376 students using u-learning to study English and indicate that all the variables for ubiquitous characteristics and two variables for learner characteristics (innovation and computer self-efficacy) had significant effects on satisfaction with u-learning and that this satisfaction had a positive effect on expectation.", "subject": "Electronic Learning, Educational Technology, Computer Assisted Instruction, English (Second Language), Foreign Countries, Student Attitudes, Satisfaction, Student Characteristics, Innovation, Learning Motivation, Self Efficacy, Structural Equation Models, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis, Elementary Secondary Education, College Students, Questionnaires, Path Analysis", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2014, "identifiersgeo": "South Korea"}, {"id": "EJ1034876", "title": "L2 Writing Practice: Game Enjoyment as a Key to Engagement", "author": "Allen, Laura K., Crossley, Scott A., Snow, Erica L., McNamara, Danielle S.", "description": "The Writing Pal (W-Pal) is an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) designed to provide students with explicit writing strategy instruction and practice.

Because of this, L2 learners and instructors alike employ different learning supports as assistance. Captions in multimedia instruction readily provide support and thus have been an ever-increasing focus of many studies. However, captions must eventually be removed, as the goal of language learning is participation in the target language where captions are not typically available. Consequently, this creates a dilemma particularly for language instructors as to the usage of captioning supports, as early removal may cause frustration, while late removal may create learning interference. Accordingly, the goal of the current study was to propose and employ a testing instrument, the Caption Reliance Test (CRT), which evaluates individual learners' reliance on captioning in second language learning environments; giving a clear indication of the learners' reliance on captioning, mirroring their support needs. Thus, the CRT was constructed comprised of an auditory track, accompanied by congruent textual captions, as well as particular incongruent textual words, to provide a means for testing. It was subsequently employed in an empirical study involving English as a Foreign Language (EFL) high school students. The results exhibited individual variances in the degree of reliance and, more importantly, exposed a negative correlation between caption reliance and L2 achievement. In other words, learners' reliance on captions varies individually and lower-level achievers rely on captions for listening comprehension more than their high-level counterparts, indicating that learners at various comprehension levels require different degrees of caption support. Thus, through employment of the CRT, instructors are able to evaluate the degree to which learners rely on the caption supports and thus make informed decisions regarding learners' requirements and utilization of captions as a multimedia learning support.", "subject": "Listening Comprehension, Multimedia Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High School Students, Tests", "source": "ReCALL", "publicationdateyear": 2013}, {"id": "EJ1004375", "title": "A Study of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication in Second Life--The ARCHI21 Experience", "author": "Wigham, Ciara R., Chanier, Thierry", "description": "Three-dimensional synthetic worlds introduce possibilities for nonverbal communication in computer-mediated language learning.

Language learning in particular has not been extensively researched despite the proliferation of game players who speak English as a foreign language within this community. To address how non-native English speaking (NNE) game players participate in language learning through game play and beyond-game culture, three generations of activity theories and a multiple-case study design were employed in this study. The asynchronous computer-mediated discourses were repeatedly reviewed, and email interviews with participants were conducted over three stages. The discourse analysis of interaction data and interview scripts showed how participants were engaged in language learning through gaming culture. First, words or phrases used in game play could be learned while playing games. Second, sentences or discourses could be practiced through interaction with native or more fluent peers in the online community after playing games. Third, these two types of engagement in gaming culture were closely related to influencing language learning through repeated practices and collaborative interactions.

The researcher therefore constructed a web-based strategy training program on the basis of L2 reading strategy research and pedagogy.

They also thought highly of the site's extensive offerings of reading opportunities supported by effective reading aids and a computerized classroom management system, features not available in large traditional classes. There was, however, a gap between what teachers thought and what students did. The teachers thought highly of Global strategies, whereas students regarded Support strategies as more useful. The low-proficiency group's heavy use of Support strategies explained this gap.

Research on interlanguage variation has shown that systematic variation is often evidenced when different phonological and syntactic forms are examined across contexts. Such systematic variation has raised important questions about the distinction between competence and performance, and generalizability of results beyond the research elicitation tasks or test tasks in SLA and LA research. However, most previous studies that have examined this issue are based on cross-sectional data with a focus on between-group differences rather than within-individual differences across different contexts. Such limited data often make it difficult for researchers to understand individual developmental trends in interlanguage as well as to interpret context effects on the learner's spoken and written language data. Electronic (E)-portfolios may address this limitation by serving as a valuable research and assessment tool for collecting and storing an individual learner's language samples obtained across different tasks over time. The technology may also enhance the situational and interactional authenticity of tasks by including multi-media input and constructed response tasks. However, it is not clear how tasks in E-portfolios can be constructed to represent various linguistic and situational contexts, and how they could be systematically evaluated and scored.

Notably the data differentiates between those technologies that students used inside and outside of formal classrooms as well as recording particular technologies and applications that students perceived as beneficial to their language learning. Secondly, this study aims to compare and contrast its findings with those from two previous studies that collected data on students' use of technologies five years earlier, in 2006, in the UK and Canada. The intention is to chart major developments and changes that have occurred during the intervening five-year period, between 2006 and 2011.

Three open-course lectures from MIT and Yale University, on psychology, physics, and music, were selected. Sixty-five Taiwanese college students participated in the study. The results of pre- and post-testing indicate that learners were able to gain L2 vocabulary knowledge by simply viewing an OCW lecture once. Level of vocabulary (academic vocabulary, technical vocabulary and low-frequency vocabulary) was found to be the most influential factor affecting vocabulary acquisition through OCW lectures. In addition, learners improved more on technical words than on academic ones. Verbal elaboration was also an important factor affecting vocabulary acquisition; the more explicit the elaboration is the greater the vocabulary gain. Frequency of occurrence, on the other hand, had positive but relatively small effects on learners' vocabulary gain.

A blog is an online journal which can be continuously updated by its users [Matheson, D. (2004). Weblogs and the epistemology of the news: Some trends in online journalism. &quot;New Media &amp; Society, 6&quot;, 443-468.]. Blogs are easy to construct without the need of understanding HTML, and their appearance and content can be enhanced through the use of pictures, audio and video files. Due to their asynchronous nature, blogs allow people to write and publish their thoughts and views at their own pace without space and time constraints. In language learning, the use of blogs is considered to be similar to that of journal writing [McLeod, 2001; as cited in Lowe, C. (2004). Moving to the public: Weblogs in the writing classroom. &quot;Into the Blogosphere&quot;. Retrieved April 16, 2009, from http://Blog.lib.umn.edu//blogosphere/moving_to_public_pf.html]. Hence, students use the basis of their worldviews to shape and interpret their own meanings in writing. Using task-based activities to encourage students' interaction, the present study explores how a blog as a computer-mediated tool engages a group of English as a Foreign Language learners at a language school in Spain in reflective and collaborative learning. Eleven students who were preparing for the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) Cambridge examination were involved in a study that lasted for five months. All the participants created their personal blogs so that they could read each other's views, share ideas and comment on their peers' postings. The activities focused on the specific writing tasks (letter writing, report, proposal, article, etc.) comprised in the aforementioned examination. Consequently, the project aimed to (1) enhance writing skills in specific writing tasks, (2) perceive the effect of the learners' feedback and (3) foster collaborative skills. Drawing on the triangulated data collated from the blog entries, class discussions based on peers' feedback and questionnaires, this paper argues that personal blogs can motivate students to build their writing skills through self-reflection and peer feedback. The engagement in negotiation of meaning between peers led to better planning and the choice of the right register/style required in each task prior to writing and submitting their work. Collaborative skills were also fostered through students' regular interaction in the blogs. For meaningful learning to take place, pedagogical intervention could encourage students to take their peers' comments into account so that they can edit their own work with a view to enhancing their writing tasks and producing mistake-free texts.

Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations, such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar, situational learning. In the experiment, the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast, the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment, findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers, students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations, thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts, defined as practice diversity, was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is, when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers, in familiar contexts, their English skills improved. After interviews with students, an interesting phenomenon was identified; students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore, students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation--learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore, the proposed system and activities can help EFL students, particularly novices, listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.

As such, it is possible that the game requires a different type of instructional support. We further speculate upon potential factors that could have affected the subjects' learning and performances.

A systematic Learning Management System (LMS) Process Improvement Model, named OASA, is proposed which enables educational institutions to establish a systematic and effective faculty development program for BL teaching and learning. OASA is structured into five levels, and transformation from lower to higher levels of capability in BL teaching and learning is based on prescribed processes, and is intended to provide a new foundation of practices. The conceptualization of OASA was demonstrated by means of a prototype with scope focusing on enhancing faculty's level of capability from Level Two to Level Three. The research has been validated using several validation methods. The main finding is that OASA is a well-founded approach that can help educational institutions overcome challenges relating to faculty's lack of knowledge in using technology in teaching. This study found that adopting OASA would make faculty development processes more understandable, give faculty a starting point for BL pedagogy, keep faculty focused on tasks, and show a process of BL improvement until faculty achieve best practices.

Integrative ePortfolios have been used successfully over the past 3 years in colleges and programs such as Writing and Rhetoric, Engineering, Business, Leadership and Service, and Technology Systems Management.

This inquiry process is the foundation for high impact learning practices such as 1st-year experiences, learning communities, capstone projects, internships, and service learning that research has shown to increase student engagement and retention. The main outcome for learner-centered instruction is to engage students in the inquiry process and integrate their learning in all areas of their lives.

The main focus of this study is to examine the role of technology savvy in terms of the experiences, skills and self-efficacy of students in using information technologies. It is hypothesized that technology savvy directly affects major e-textbook experiences, including perceived e-textbook helpfulness, student involvement and learning outcome, as well as moderates the relationships among them. Based on the data gathered through a survey, the results suggest that the e-textbook experiences of students vary significantly across technology veterans and novices, suggesting a salient direct effect of technology savvy on e-textbook experiences. Also, the mediating relationship between e-textbook helpfulness and learning outcome through student involvement is stronger for technology veterans than novices, suggesting a salient moderating effect of technology savvy on the relationships among e-textbook experiences. An additional comparison based on gender is performed to find out whether the gender stereotyping regarding technology usage holds true for the new generation of students in the use of e-textbooks. The results show that gender does not fully account for the differences in e-textbook experiences, and its moderating effect on their relationships is not as strong as that of technology savvy.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines existing open academic courses initiatives and presents a conceptual model for describing an academic course. Next, the elements of the conceptual model are mapped to the CDM specification, as well as to the CDM-ECTS application profile for describing (open) academic courses with ECTS compatible information. Finally, the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool is presented, which allows authoring of (open) academic courses descriptions based on the proposed conceptual model and by following the CDM-ECTS application profile. Findings: Based on the evaluation results, it is evident that ASK-CDM-ECTS can clearly support the process of describing academic courses offered by European Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with ECTS compatible information following the CDM-ECTS application profile; and the process of searching and retrieving academic courses offered by European HEIs. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation scenarios were executed with users' representatives from only one HEI. Future work intends to conduct further experiments involving users' representatives from different HEIs for evaluating the proposed tool. Social implications: OpenCourseWare has become a social movement aiming to equal opportunities in education. This paper presents the ASK-CDM-ECTS tool, which can be exploited for setting-up European Open Courses Initiatives that will facilitate open access to education and learning for the societies of the EU Member States. Originality/value: Despite the development of the CDM specification for describing (open) academic courses, and of its application profile CDM-ECTS, it appears that there exists no software tool that allows authoring and publishing on the web descriptions of (open) academic courses following CDM-ECTS.

The paper aims to introduce ONTODAPS, the Ontology-Driven Disability-Aware Personalised E-Learning System, which has the mechanism for such personalisation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews current e-learning systems that provide personalisation for students, including their strengths and weaknesses. The paper presents personalisation and its techniques and then presents ONTODAPS, which personalises learning resources and services to students. In total, three case studies are considered to show how personalisation is achieved using ONTODAPS. Findings: This paper shows that it is possible to use automated ontology-based agents intercommunicating to provide an effective personalisation for disabled students. The results reveal that ONTODAPS is flexible enough to provide enough control and freedom to drive their learning. The results also suggest that ONTODAPS has the ability to provide appropriate levels of learner control by allowing them to self-direct learning through personalising learning resources and then allowing them to choose which resources they wish to access. This thus gives them a sense of ownership and control. Research limitations/implications: This research reveals that it is possible for e-learning systems to personalise learning for users with multiple disabilities. Thus, by considering the needs of such users and consulting them in the design and development process, developers of e-learning systems can produce systems that are both accessible and usable by students with disabilities. Practical implications: The inclusion of multiple formats of learning resources and personalisation of their presentation to students means students will have increased access to such resources, with the potential of consuming and assimilating the information. This also has the potential of improving understanding and hence and improvement in results. Social implications: This research shows that ONTODAPS is a medium where disabled students can have equivalent learning experience with their non-disabled peers. This could potentially increase access to learning for disabled students and possibly help improve their results due to an increase in accessibility of learning resources and usability of the system. This system thus complies with contemporary legislation which requires \"reasonable adjustments\" or \"reasonable accommodations\" to be made to meet the needs of disabled people. Originality/value: Although personalisation has been applied in e-commerce systems, making them very successful, such personalisation is still a wish for e-learning systems which struggle to catch up.

Further analysis indicated that students' current programming skills, prior programming experience, and grade expectations are significant antecedents of learning performance in the course. Results support the conclusion suggesting that when teaching introductory programming courses, instructors may want to consider choosing the student-centered active learning over the traditional lecture format in order to improve students' learning performance.

This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 212 students in Taiwan and various relationships in the research model were tested using the partial least squares approach. Findings: The findings show that perceived usefulness and ease of use are determinants of student acceptance of u-learning. Absorptive capacity (understanding, assimilating and applying u-learning) perceptions influence perceived usefulness and ease of use of u-learning. Additionally, assessment of the moderating effect of prior mobile experience on model relationships reveals insights into the determinants of behavioral intention to use u-learning. Practical implications: Personal absorptive capacity to understand, assimilate, and apply u-learning affects student perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of u-learning, which in turn influence usage intentions. Thus, students should be offered demonstrations of how to operate u-learning. More importantly, training courses on various mobile and context-aware services should be provided to students to equip them with comprehensive knowledge of u-learning, improve their real-world observational skills, reduce anxiety associated with u-learning, and increase their confidence in using u-learning.

It examined the relative importance of motivational variables as theorised in the field of second language (L2) motivation, and the effect of first language (L1) and linguistic background (English only versus other), country of birth (the UK versus other), choice of target language (French versus Spanish) and centre of study (specialist language department versus language centre). Despite the &quot;monoglot culture&quot; that prevails in many English-speaking countries, having an English-only profile and especially being born in the UK proved to be important motivating factors in the participants' decision to learn a foreign language. Few significant differences were found between learners of French and Spanish, which were both deemed to have continued instrumental value despite the dominance of English in the world today.

The present study proposes that instead of looking at isolated variables, researchers should instead take a top-down approach by starting at the level of students' overall experience of language learning. One way to investigate this is through language experience interviews, in which students are asked to reflect on general and specific aspects of their language experience. In the present study, language experience interviews were conducted with 12 beginning French learners at an American university, and six focal participants were selected based on their performance on spoken and written narrative tasks at the beginning and end of one semester. Qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed that high performing students seemed more focused on grammar learning and construction of meaning than low performing students, who were more focused on memorization and vocabulary. Case studies are presented to explore learner experience in more depth. Overall, the study provides support for language experience interviews as higher-level units that may relate individual differences to differential second language performance.

Information security management education should address the gap between the academic ideals and practice. This paper introduces a teaching method that has been in use as coursework for ten years. In addition to the theoretical lectures on information security management issues, the students of the course perform information security assessments of local small and medium enterprises (SME). The general assessment of the information security status of a company gives the students a view into what the companies have taken into practice and if they have used theoretical models to guide their work. The analysis of the status and suggestions for improvements also teach the students to scale the theory with the size and operations of the company. This is important because usually information security management literature takes the viewpoint of large organizations, whereas the companies that participate in the assessment are small or medium-sized. Course feedback from the students shows that the assignment is perceived to be useful and interesting, and that it works well when paired with the theoretical teaching of the course.

Every society needs to create ideas for further development and in order to become recognised as developed. The purpose of this paper is to show how different cultures at different times created similar ideas and theories to develop their society. Design/methodology/approach: A comparison between the development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun and Wallerstein's famous &quot;world system theory&quot; is undertaken to show that similar ideas of development were in existence even centuries before. Technically, seminar papers were posted and reviewed on an e-learning platform in order to reach such peer-reviewed assessment in a &quot;Global Studies&quot; curriculum. Findings: The paper shows that the similarity between all developed countries is a strong state and extensive economic activity in different areas among cooperative people. All of these three characteristics are measurable and visible in today's western societies, and also centuries before in other countries (the Golden Age of the Muslim World). Research limitations/implications: Limits to comparing the two development theories of Ibn-i-Khaldun with Wallerstein's world system theory arise because of the large gap in time and the big cultural differences between the authors of the two theories. There is, on one side, Ibn-i-Khaldun in the thirteenth century whose religion (Islam) played an important role in his development theory and on the other side there is a western author, Immanuel Wallerstein in the twentieth century. In Wallerstein's development theory, religion has almost no role. Another point is that Wallerstein's theory provides a guideline to almost all countries for reaching development but Ibn-i-Khaldun's target countries are the Muslim countries which were experiencing decline at his time.

DPSFM utilizes performance-based actions with facilitation methods to help participants design action plans. Interactive Management (IM) utilizes a holistic, culturally sensitive and systemic approach to resolve complex problems. Communication technological assistance is accompanied by IM to enhance parsimony and support saliency of the ideas generated. Both approaches support action plans. This paper argues that both DPSFM and IM are theoretical frameworks that are valuable for conflict resolution, educators, and social science specialists who are interested in conducting research under the paradigm of knowing referred to as \"Scholarship of Engagement\". This paradigm engages participants in research while promoting action plans and improving status quo conditions. The current paper overviews the benefits of both models and makes a strong case for application of their communication technologies across a variety of contexts. DPSFM and IM are directly involved with promoting change, and supporting actions to improve human conditions. The framework of \"Scholarship of Engagement\" is introduced as an integrative model for \"praxis\". The purpose of this paper was to provide alternative options for working in facilitation groups.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses in depth the current status of grid electricity in Africa continent and suggested solar electricity as an alternative cost-effective method to the existing grid electricity problem in remote areas. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, health, communication, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on how solar power generation can be developed. Findings: The paper shows that in developed countries where ICT has been applied extensively, ICT offers increased opportunities for sustainable economic development and plays a critical role in rapid economic growth, productive capacity improvements, education, government, agriculture and international competitiveness enhancement. The paper has pointed out that ICT has yet to make significant impact in most African countries due to lack of reliable and adequate electricity. Solar electricity has been seen as the most cost-effective way of generating electricity, especially in remote rural areas, for ICT devices. For the widespread of solar power generation in Africa, various strategies have been identified which include training of qualified solar engineers and technicians, establishing PV markets and business modes, introduction of solar energy education in schools and universities, political leaders appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for rural communities, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs. Practical implications: The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established PV markets and business modes (especially in remote areas), lack of solar energy education in schools have to be addressed before the benefits of ICT in Africa can be seen. Other issues include African countries appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing.

After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners.

From a sociocultural theoretical perspective, the current study investigated the language development outcomes and process in a 10-week Sino-American telecollaborative project involving 10 college-level American learners of Mandarin Chinese and their respective native Chinese partners from China. The findings show that the American learners' production quantity in Mandarin Chinese increased steadily throughout the project whereas the quality of their production didn't improve as rapidly. These learners also self-reported gains in age-appropriate cultural information, reading ability, and expanded vocabulary. The analysis shows the gains can be attributed to the scaffolding conditions (van Lier, 1996, 2004) that focused on friendship building and idea sharing in Mandarin Chinese and were specifically manifested in the operation of intersubjectivity, contingent help, and handover by both American learners and their Chinese partners throughout the project.

Research limitations/implications: These data analysis has still to be complemented by sociological, political and economic theories providing insights into global restructuration processes and structural transitions through globalisation. Practical implications: &quot;Forward-looking&quot; as an emerging scientific discipline is supported by the proposed detailed analytical methods, namely by providing quantitative, in-depth techno-socio-economic megatrends.

It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal.

The author's methodology and approach take note of the basic principles of the globalisation theory and include the recognition of the fact that the contradiction between global interdependent problems of the planetary scale on one side and the existing rather fragmentary and desultory way of acquiring knowledge on the other side is the main challenge to the present and future quality of the human potential. Findings: Considering ways how to continue the work on ESD after the end of the UN DESD in 2014, the author expresses a point of view that it should be an innovation project requiring state, public, law and financial support.

Another aim is to propose an outline for the globalization measurement methodology that would take a systemic approach to revealing the global flows (both their direction and content) and networks, which will allow the multidimensionality in globalization measurement crucial for proposing and verifying formal explanations and hypotheses, as well as for developing globalization forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: Several methodologies for globalization measurements are compared in the paper, among the most important are variations of the index compilation methodology, and methods of network analysis. Findings: For Global Studies curricula, globalization measurement tools much more complex than indices are needed. A possible solution could lie in the analysis of country-to-country flows (and networks which these flows form), which appears much more data- and effort-consuming than the methodologies behind the index compilation, will allow the elaboration of a systemic vision of globalization and the interactions between its various aspects, which should necessarily underlie the Global Studies curricula.

Students can benefit from the study of information systems security when security concepts are introduced in the context of real-world industry standards. The development of a data security standard for organizations operating within the credit card payment industry serves as an excellent example of a real-world security standard that lends itself to classroom study. The establishment and requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the associated consequences for noncompliance, represents a businesslike approach to the organizational protection of data that students will find interesting and one to which they will relate. Everybody uses credit cards! Incorporating the topic of PCI DSS into an activity allows students to learn and apply PCI DSS concepts to a business setting.

A hypothetical business teaching case, &quot;Blue Mountain Jams&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;), illustrates the challenge of PCI DSS mandates for small businesses. Small business is given some leeway in self-assessment under PCI DSS to document compliance after the decision is made to accept credit card payments.

Its goal is to help researchers in finding related works. Further, this paper seeks to explore the effect of using relational features in addition to textual features on the quality of recommended citations. Design/methodology/approach: In order to propose a novel citation recommendation system, first a new relational similarity measure is proposed for calculating the relatedness of two publications. Then, a recommendation algorithm is presented that uses both relational and textual features to compute the semantic distances of publications of a bibliographic dataset from the input text. Findings: The evaluation of the proposed system shows that combining relational features with textual features leads to better recommendations, in comparison with relying only on the textual features. It also demonstrates that citation context plays an important role among textual features. In addition, it is concluded that different relational features have different contributions to the proposed similarity measure. Originality/value: A new citation recommendation system is proposed which uses a novel semantic distance measure.

However, they do not usually consider external collaborations as a strategic issue despite their benefits. The purpose of this paper consists of identifying different patterns of collaboration and internationalization of universities, with the aim of helping managers and policy makers to take decisions related to their national research policies. Design/methodology/approach: Co-authorship analysis has been used in conjunction with social network analysis to model inter-institutional collaborations as networks, extracting these collaborations from the Web of Science database. Using several structural properties of the extracted networks and applying a statistical treatment, the main profiles of collaborations and internationalization have been obtained. Findings: Obtained results distinguish three patterns of collaborations according to the intensity and scope of collaborations. The statistical treatment also provides a segmentation of universities according to their collaboration profiles. Finally, universities are represented in bi-dimensional maps using external collaborations as a measure of similarity. Research limitations/implications: Although this study is restricted to English universities, it could probably be extended at least to other countries in the European Union or even other developed countries.

A content analysis of services records shows how each user group falls into the multiple data services levels and subcategories. Findings: Library users can be classified into many different categories, and each of these may have different needs. Research centers might have big projects involving data gathering and applications where a librarian can mainly provide consultation; while an individual faculty member or student might need the librarians as research partners, with help for their specific problems.

If certain variables do not fully comply with the independent hypothesis, it is not possible to conduct proper analysis, which leads to false conclusions. To solve these problems, the aim of this research is to adopt an expert opinion-driven decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and re-establish the causal relationship and the degree of interrelationship of DTPB variables. Design/methodology/approach: This research used a university library website as an individual case, and illustrated the benefits of constructing DTPB model by using DEMATEL through the opinions of 23 experts surveyed by questionnaires. Findings: According to the analysis result of constructing DTPB model by using DEMATEL, when DTPB variables were distributed within quadrants of high centrality and degree of causality, they became the key influential variables; when distributed within quadrants of low centrality and degree of causality, the variables needed urgent management. Originality/value: When traditional DTPB does not consider the direct and indirect relationships among variables, the original causal relationship of variables will be influenced, and then the original variables cannot fully demonstrate their causal relationship. Therefore the feasibility and effect of constructing DTPB model by using DEMATEL proposed in this research are proved through individual cases.

Design/methodology/approach: Three surveys of 266 ETD repositories, 15 common ETD management software solutions, and 136 ETD experts were conducted in order to appraise the protocols. These protocols were evaluated in four categories of aggregation, syndication, distributed search, and publishing protocols. Findings: This study revealed that, despite its drawbacks, Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH) is still the most utilized interoperability protocol within ETD providers, ETD software developers, and implementers, followed by ATOM and Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) protocols. However, in all competitive areas related to performance and functionality, ORE surpasses other protocols. It was also found that the three protocols of ATOM, PMH, and ORE could be used interchangeably in the most used cases of interoperability protocols in repositories.

The research aims to elaborate the methods that help to compare of the data concerning physical activity both built-in an accelerometer in Cardiac Resychrinisation Therapy (CRT) devices and data obtained from an external Actigraph GT3XE-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor. 5 persons participated in the pilot study (n = 5); mean age: 57 \u00b1 13.37; BMI: 90.6 \u00b1 7.63. The Actigraph data from CRT device were examined in a 6-day-interval, between February 28 and March 5, 2014. The investigation started conducting a 6-minute walking test and continued with the measurement of daily physical activity. For data analysis descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used. It is clear from the data obtained from Actigraph that the MET values (mean: 1.17 \u00b1 0.096) of the patients in the sample were extremely low due to their disease. However, some patients with higher physical activity than average (1.26; 1.28) seemed to be noteworthy, but they showed lower performance than healthy people. The physical activity of the patients during the 6-minute walking test corresponded to 1.9-2.48 MET. The physical activity of patients was found typically in the &quot;light or moderate range&quot; classifying the physical activity by Actigraph. Data from Actigraph are accurate and detailed making the physical activity of the patients measurable and appreciable. The results of the 6-minute walking test were in the category from moderate to very vigorous for individualized moderate physical performance based on Actigraph. It indicates the individual performance differences among patients. However, the daily physical performance is even lower than that of the 6-minute walking. We can conclude from the data related to the percentage of the average activity in CRT system to the average energy consumption and the improvement in the patients' physical condition. Due to the limitations of the sampling frequency the different time intervals cannot be isolated in the different intensity ranges.

Objectives: The study aimed at the determination of body mass index for persons living in residential institutions and families, exploration its impact on walking and self-care as two, objective factors of life quality. Method: Data collection of persons aged 3-35 with Down syndrome living in families covered seven counties, while those of living in residential institutions covered thirteen counties in Hungary. In the 183 cases studied 76 people in residential institutions, 107 people lived in families. The cross-sectional study was processed by non-random sample selection. The questionnaires were filled out by health visitors and care takers edited by their own. Results: 50.6% of adults and 26.1% of children belonged to the overweight or obese category. Their residence showed a significant correlation with the body mass index (p&lt; 0.001). Overweight and obese persons in families, while thin ones were more prevalent in institutions. Regarding the walking ability and self-care of the persons living in families a significantly higher level of development was achieved (p&lt; 0.001). Walking ability (p = 0.001) and self-care (p = 0,008) were worsened by less body weight significantly, while overweight or obesity influenced it less negatively. Discussion: The claim is not further acceptable whereas persons with Down syndrome are more prone to obesity than average people. However unfavourable weight gain in adults draws attention to the necessity to a healthy diet and regular exercise. The people living in residential institutions with significantly lower body mass index and the associated low development of walking ability and self-care envisages an urgent reform of residential institutions.

One of the most numerous cultural groups that have settled in the southern Spain is from Romania. Coexistence, especially in schools, has made us become interested in knowing the eating habits at breakfast of Romanian and Spanish populations. Numerous studies show that the food intake at breakfast, mostly made before leaving home, has an incidence on the physic wellbeing of adolescent throughout the day. The processes of acculturation are also inseparable from the eating habits, health and life, that maintain the migrant teenagers. Breakfast is analyzed as one of the habits more associated with diet quality; paradoxically, one of the findings of our study, many adolescents do not take a proper breakfast every day. Objectives: The study analyzes the characteristics and the main cultural and gender differences in the implementation of breakfast: its maintenance or omission in young autochthonous and immigrants of Romanian origin in the southeast Spanish schools. Design. This is a cross-sectional study with a cluster sampling in two Primary schools and seven Secondary schools. The instrument applied was an adaptation of the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. Sample.

Results: In the study we identified 1.2% of Spaniards and 3.3% of Romanians who either skip breakfast or do not eat foods throughout the morning. The main breakfast foods of the Spanish students are dairy, bread and cereals, cookies, juice and olive oil; for the Romanian students the basic foods at breakfast are cereals, dairy products, juices, biscuits and jams. We have found significant differences between the two compared cultural groups. We also found significant differences between the food eaten by men of the two cultural groups (Spanish and Romanian) and by the food eaten by women (Spanish and Romanian) in the breakfast food. Conclusions: The results show the need to further promote and implement educational programs that encourage students to make breakfast before leaving home.

To date, nearly 30 CALL-SLA syntheses and meta-analyses have been conducted, covering topics from hypertext glosses (Yun, 2011) to synchronous computer-mediated communication (Ziegler, 2015) to game-based learning (Chiu, Kao, &amp; Reynolds, 2012).

Like other online journals started in the 1990s, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to enhance the speed of publication and the accessibility of published research. Yet &quot;LLT&quot; had an additional goal: to raise the rigor of published research in its targeted area. Thus, rather than seeking to be defined principally by its mode or style of publication, &quot;LLT&quot; sought to be the highest quality journal in an emerging area of inquiry. This sounds like an obvious goal, but &quot;LLT&quot; was going against the grain. By the time the first issue of &quot;LLT&quot; appeared in 1997, there was already a popular notion of a dichotomy between print journals (which alone printed rigorous peer reviewed research) and online journals (which were accessible but not rigorously reviewed). Indeed, at the time, many academics refused to submit work to online journals, believing (or knowing) that their institutions would fail to recognize articles published in online venues. To break out of this stereotype, &quot;LLT&quot; recruited a top notch editorial board, including leading applied linguistics from around the world. For its inaugural issue in July 1997, the journal invited internationally recognized applied linguistics to submit papers on the topic Language Learning &amp; Technology: Defining the Research Agenda. The resources of the NFLRC and CLEAR were used to achieve broad publicity. &quot;LLT&quot; quickly gathered broad attention. With questions of funding, peer review, and other matters still under debate, the future of academic journal publishing is very much in flux.

In addition to more travel options and greater technology availability, study abroad has changed in other significant ways. In the US, more students are going abroad for short-term programs (less than 8 weeks), and the participants represent more diverse academic fields, with an increasing number of students from the sciences, social sciences, and business-related fields. The image of the North American student going abroad primarily for language learning, spending a semester or more, no longer fits reality. In fact, many students now engage in service learning, internships, or volunteer work while abroad. Nevertheless, study abroad remains an expected experience for students with a serious interest in language learning. In this column we will be looking at the varied roles that technology can play in the study abroad experience. Some argue that the availability of Internet-based social media while abroad is for language learning and cross-cultural understanding at best a distraction and at worst an inhibitor of full engagement in the target culture, inevitably leading to less exposure to the target language and therefore fewer opportunities for language proficiency gains. The author argues that in fact, technology can play a positive role, particularly if students are provided with appropriate guidance and support. The main areas to be discussed are the personal and learning benefits of technology use while abroad, the formation of second-language identities, the affordances for pragmatic language development, the integration of mobile devices for place-based language learning, and the opportunities for enhancement of intercultural communication competence.", "subject": "Technology Integration, Technology Uses in Education, Educational Technology, Study Abroad, Second Language Learning, Cultural Awareness, Social Media, Identification (Psychology), Language Skills, Communicative Competence (Languages), Intercultural Communication", "source": "Language Learning & Technology", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1143726", "title": "Investigating the Application of Automated Writing Evaluation to Chinese Undergraduate English Majors: A Case Study of &quot;WriteToLearn&quot;", "author": "Liu, Sha, Kunnan, Antony John", "description": "This study investigated the application of &quot;WriteToLearn&quot; on Chinese undergraduate English majors' essays in terms of its scoring ability and the accuracy of its error feedback.

Universities and colleges provide specific honor codes or have administrative units to promote good behaviors and resolve dishonesty allegations. Students, faculty, and staff have stakes in maintaining high levels of academic integrity to ensure their degrees' value and preserve respect for their institutions. Often, these efforts result in disparate local dialogs and various approaches to create and maintain cultures of integrity. Despite this, academic integrity receives relatively little attention in the academic literature. Several underlying reasons may exist. First, people generally do not want to reveal dishonest actions and this makes research difficult. Second, students come from a variety of backgrounds and cultural settings with different perspectives on academic integrity; some from high school environments with differing views on academic integrity. This context has resulted in the growth of information services and software products designed to structure and enable academic integrity activities and compliance. However, taken by themselves, these services provide only a partial solution.

Also, their perceptions of how intellectually stimulating STEM courses were for them throughout their school years seems to affect their choice of a major. This paper aims at distinguishing when and why such majors are chosen through a survey instrument geared toward STEM majors and separates the results by gender and major, identifying when and why each group selected the major they did. The potential value of this research is in determining where efforts could be more specifically focused to recruit into STEM majors.", "subject": "Gender Differences, Student Interests, Majors (Students), Information Systems, Computer Science Education, STEM Education, Student Surveys, Influences, Student Attitudes, College Students, Likert Scales", "source": "Information Systems Education Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2016, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"id": "EJ1126054", "title": "Teaching Case: Introduction to NoSQL in a Traditional Database Course", "author": "Fowler, Brad, Godin, Joy, Geddy, Margaret", "description": "Many organizations are dealing with the increasing demands of big data, so they are turning to NoSQL databases as their preferred system for handling the unique problems of capturing and storing massive amounts of data.

Increasing delays in the traditional publication timeline, coupled with high subscription costs, have resulted in a diminished ability for IS faculty and their students to access the most relevant research in a timely manner, an issue felt most acutely in developing nations. As IS educators seeks to increase the dissemination of their work and ensure that students have the most updated knowledge, one option is publishing in open-access (OA) journals. However, a lack of knowledge, inconsistent quality perceptions, the presence of predatory journals, and publication fees have negatively affected IS researchers' support for OA publishing. This study surveyed 68 IS scholars and found that IS scholars do not publish in OA journals due to concerns about fees, quality, prestige, and impact factors. This study found more similarities than differences between junior- and senior-level IS scholars, with junior faculty members placing more emphasis on the speed of publication than their senior colleagues do. By understanding the underlying reasons that IS faculty are favoring OA options, the study hopes to shed light on the reliance on traditional journal publication models that restrict the distribution of intellectual property.

A total of 1000 Hungarian women aged 15 to 60 years were included in the sample. The results of our study revealed that 13.8% of women participating in our research program have never been to a gynaecological cancer screening. Concerning this fact, the following groups deserve greater attention: 15-19 years old, those only with basic school qualifications, the unmarried and the unemployed.

The participants completed the self-administered, modular questionnaire and the standard EPDS questionnaire anonymously. 35% of mothers of twins reached or exceeded the threshold value for depression following the first six months after delivery. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of the suspected cases among the primipara and multipara (p = 1.000). At the same time, artificial conception proved to be a significant risk factor (p = 0.019). Distraught family life (p = 0.001) and unfavorable changes in a domestic partnership (p = 0.009) increased the prevalence of the suspected cases of depression significantly.

Our research questions were the following: 1. What is the ratio of women participating in mammography screening? 2. What factors influence the attendance of the screening? A quantitative, cross-sectional, and descriptive study (2013) examined women aged 35-65 without a history of breast cancer from Kecskem\u00e9t City and its region. Non-random, convenience sampling method was applied in the study. The self-edited and self-administered questionnaire included the following groups of questions: socio-demographic data, attitude examination related to screening, reasons for absence. Besides SPSS Statistics, 20.00 test, x2 test, t-test, and ANOVA were used (p&lt;0.05). During the Principal Component Analysis, 23 variables of the motivational scale were grouped into six theoretical subgroups, and the Cronbach-alpha value was 0.758. The mean age of the participants was 49.96 \u00b1 8.91 years.71% of the interviewees never attended breast cancer screening. Regarding the sample, the mean age of women participating in the screening for the first time was 39.66 \u00b1 12.21 years. Women with college/university degree attained high scores on the knowledge test (p&lt;0.05). A significant part of women went to the screening because they feel responsibility for their health status or due to the family history of breast cancer. Fear, shame, or inconveniences during examination did not affect participation in screening.

Design in the natural and commercial sciences is largely peripheral. Although not ignored, design in the sciences predominates as a dialect of problem-solving rather than artifact creation. Information Systems (IS) as a fusion of computer science and business struggles with the identity and role of design as it leans heavily on its roots in mathematics and formal logic with the scattered influences of statistics (data analysis) as practiced in research among the social and behavioral sciences. Design as a practical skill is a critical ingredient in successful information systems. Yet, design as a distinctive element in programs and curricula of IS and computing is (at best) haphazardly diffused--if not completely omitted. This paper presents a special ontology of design to frame the opportunities and justification for conscious and deliberate design pedagogy in IS and computing education.
