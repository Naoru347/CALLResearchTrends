However, this broad and generic assessment of reading comprehension overlooks the specific aspects and processes that students need to develop. This study adopted Kintsch's Construction-Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels. EFL teachers can guide students to use online annotations to different extents in order to deepen their reading comprehension.","subject":"Reading Comprehension, Reading Instruction, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Documentation, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, College Freshmen, Pretests Posttests, Discussion, Vocabulary, Notetaking, Computer Uses in Education, Reading Improvement, Foreign Countries","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1080778","title":"Facilitating Metacognitive Processes of Academic Genre-Based Writing Using an Online Writing System","author":"Yeh, Hui-Chin","description":"Few studies have investigated how metacognitive processes foster the application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. This is largely due to its internal and unobservable characteristics. To bridge this gap, an online writing system based on metacognition, involving the stages of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, was developed to investigate how such a system contributed to the understanding and application of genre knowledge to students' academic writing. The data included three different versions of each student's written research proposal, action logs, discussion transcripts in discussion forums, and an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, a typical case sampling, and the constant comparison method were used to analyze the data. The results suggested that the students made greater improvements in academic writing performance after experiencing metacognitive processes. Particularly, collaborative efforts throughout the metacognitive processes were important in supporting students to understand the academic genre, recognize the problems of unstructured academic papers, and apply genre knowledge to academic writing. The online writing system features, designed to nurture students' metacognitive processes, served as useful cognitive stimuli to raise students' metacognitive awareness. The system's functions overcame the limitations of observing students' metacognitive processes described in previous studies, and enabled teachers to provide follow-up instruction.

The system uses ASR technology to process the learner's responses and to detect errors so that immediate corrective feedback (CF) can be provided on learner errors. We evaluate the system as a learning environment by analyzing proficiency gains in pre- and post-tests, the logs of the practice sessions, and the learners' appreciation of the system. In this paper, we present two learning conditions: (1) the learners received oral practice and immediate CF on spoken performance and (2) learners received oral practice and NO CF on spoken performance. We found that our system was successful in providing L2 speaking practice. Results show that both groups improve their proficiency on the target feature as a result of treatment. Between the groups there is no significant difference in learning, but the groups proceeded differently through the sessions, and the learners in the group that received automatic CF evaluated the system more positively than the NO CF group.

Data were collected through a survey of 531 students in an urban public middle school in the USA. The results showed that students used technology for diverse purposes regardless of their first language background. Although overall technology students' access was comparable to national averages, the use of technology for many specific purposes was markedly lower, lending support to the notion of a new digital divide between students from high- and low-income families based on technology knowledge and meaningful application of such knowledge rather than mere access. Student reports of their own English skills were related to various specific uses of technology, e.g., blogging and email.

While the type of instructional setting was not found to significantly impact the teaching performance of the interns, interview data suggested that support from a cooperating teacher and prior experience working with students of diverse language and cultural backgrounds strongly influenced the teacher candidates' instructional practices.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Cooperating Teachers, Student Teachers, Mixed Methods Research, Internship Programs, Comparative Analysis, Supervisors, Online Courses, Prior Learning, Teacher Attitudes, Conventional Instruction, Cultural Differences, Cultural Background, Teaching Methods, College Faculty, Language Teachers, Meta Analysis, Teacher Education, Graduate Students, Semi Structured Interviews, Pretests Posttests","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1059236","title":"Factors Affecting the Normalization of CALL in Chinese Senior High Schools","author":"He, Bi, Puakpong, Nattaya, Lian, Andrew","description":"With the development of Information Technology, increasing attention has been paid to Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Meanwhile, increasing enthusiasm is seen for English learning and teaching in China. Yet, few research studies have focused on the normalization of CALL in ethnically diverse areas. In response to this research gap, this study aims to identify major factors affecting the normalization of CALL in Chinese senior high schools in the Qian Xi'nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture (QBMP). A questionnaire was administered to 340 English teachers and a semi-structured oral interview was conducted as a follow-up. The study produced the following four findings: (a) most teachers were in favor of using computers in English teaching although they had to be cautious in guiding students; (b) institutional support was seen as instrumental; (c) teachers' computer competency and relevant training were considered to be important; and (d) teaching methodology and learner factors were identified as crucial.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), High Schools, English Teachers, Secondary School Teachers, Questionnaires, Semi Structured Interviews, Teacher Attitudes, Computer Attitudes, Computer Literacy, Teaching Methods","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"id":"EJ1080783","title":"Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Scaffolding of L2 Collocations in the Context of Concordancing","author":"Rezaee, Abbas Ali, Marefat, Hamideh, Saeedakhtar, Afsaneh","description":"Collocational competence is recognized to be integral to native-like L2 performance, and concordancing can be of assistance in gaining this competence. This study reports on an investigation into the effect of symmetrical and asymmetrical scaffolding on the collocational competence of Iranian intermediate learners of English in the context of concordancing. It also surveys the learners' attitudes towards the role of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to examine the effects of the treatments given over 10 sessions on L2 collocations in the receptive and productive tasks. Results demonstrated that the three groups of participants who received the treatment tasks in the context of concordancing under symmetrical, asymmetrical, and no-scaffolding conditions, improved their knowledge of collocations significantly both in the receptive and productive tasks compared to the control group which had no access to concordancing and did not receive scaffolding. However, there was no significant difference among the performances of the concordancing groups either in the receptive or in the productive tasks. Moreover, learners expressed positive attitudes towards both concordancing and scaffolding.","subject":"Computational Linguistics, Phrase Structure, Scaffolding (Teaching Technique), Foreign Countries, Control Groups, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Task Analysis, Student Attitudes, Receptive Language, Pretests Posttests, Role, Expressive Language, Positive Attitudes, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Questionnaires, Likert Scales, College Students, Statistical Analysis","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Iran"},{"id":"EJ1063476","title":"Investigating an Innovative Computer Application to Improve L2 Word Recognition from Speech","author":"Matthews, Joshua, O'Toole, John Mitchell","description":"The ability to recognise words from the aural modality is a critical aspect of successful second language (L2) listening comprehension. However, little research has been reported on computer-mediated development of L2 word recognition from speech in L2 learning contexts. This report describes the development of an innovative computer application to improve L2 word recognition from speech, and goes on to describe an exploratory study of its use by 33 English as a second language (ESL) students. The study detected significant differences between word recognition scores measured before and after participants used the application. The manner with which students engaged with the computer application in terms of word recognition, self-determined exposure to speech input (repetitions) and modified output productivity (revisions) are also described and analysed. Differences in engagement by learners with different word recognition capabilities are noted. The paper concludes with a discussion of some recommendations for the use of computer-assisted development of L2 word recognition from speech and also provides concrete suggestions for much needed further empirical research in this area.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Word Recognition, Linguistic Input, Computer Assisted Instruction, Teaching Methods, Speech, Listening Comprehension, English (Second Language), Learner Engagement, Psycholinguistics, Asians, College Students, Foreign Countries, Word Lists, Pretests Posttests, Language Tests, Student Attitudes, Attitude Measures, Scores, Accuracy, Verbal Communication","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Asia"},{"id":"EJ1059267","title":"Blogs and the Development of Plurilingual and Intercultural Competence: Report of a Co-Actional Approach in Portuguese Foreign Language Classroom","author":"Melo-Pfeifer, S\u00edlvia","description":"Focusing on the topic of the development of the plurilingual and intercultural competence through the integration of electronic communicative practices both in foreign language classrooms and non-formal contexts, this work aims at defining and characterizing, in view of a co-actional perspective, a &quot;pedagogical blog&quot;, by considering it from three different axes: a personal and social dimension, a collaborative and co-actional dimension and the management of linguistic and cultural repertoires dimension. In order to do so, this contribution presents and describes a case study which will highlight how blogs can be used in order to develop plurilingual and intercultural competences: we will present the classroom dynamics developed by the blog &quot;Falar pelos cotovelos&quot;, a year-long project created within the scope of the teaching and learning of Portuguese as a foreign language, in a non-formal setting (non-scholar public).

To date, however, there is still limited understanding of how EFL writers may make use of such tools along with dictionaries when engaging in a writing task. To better understand the question, this study investigated a class of non-English-major college students (N = 14) over a semester. Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning. This study provides empirical data that help to better understand how corpus tools contribute to EFL writing.","subject":"Dictionaries, Indexes, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computational Linguistics, Nonmajors, Writing (Composition), Phrase Structure, Recall (Psychology), Bilingualism, Monolingualism, Video Technology, Grammar, Definitions, Intuition, Writing Processes, College Students, Writing Instruction, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Observation, Foreign Countries, Questionnaires","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1059286","title":"Effect of Training Japanese L1 Speakers in the Production of American English \/r\/ Using Spectrographic Visual Feedback","author":"Patten, Iomi, Edmonds, Lisa A.","description":"The present study examines the effects of training native Japanese speakers in the production of American \/r\/ using spectrographic visual feedback. Within a modified single-subject design, two native Japanese participants produced single words containing \/r\/ in a variety of positions while viewing live spectrographic feedback with the aim of producing \/r\/ with a third formant (F3) frequency of less than 2300\u00a0Hz (upper threshold for identifiable \/r\/). Feedback was gradually reduced to promote independent production and monitoring. Both participants showed improvement in \/r\/ production in trained and untrained single words as indicated by percentage increases and effect sizes. Blind ratings by independent experts indicated significant \/r\/ production improvements during the reading of the Rainbow Passage. Perceptual distinction of \/r\/ and \/l\/ in minimal pairs also showed an upward trend. These findings suggest that spectrographic visual feedback is a promising method for training \/r\/ to Japanese-speaking English language learners.","subject":"Japanese, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Visual Stimuli, Feedback (Response), Teaching Methods, Phonology, Phonemes, Articulation (Speech), Cues, Adults, Training, Pronunciation, Audio Equipment, Pretests Posttests, Oral Reading, Repetition, Prompting, Listening, Instructional Effectiveness, Scores, Comparative Analysis, Accuracy","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
