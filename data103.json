ESL teachers intending to analyse English language subject textbooks written for secondary school students with the aim of gaining information about what bilingual secondary school students need to know in terms of language to process academic textbooks cannot avoiding deal with a dilemma. It needs to be decided which way it is most appropriate to analyse the texts in question. Handbooks of English applied linguistics are not immensely helpful with regard to this problem as they tend not to give recommendation as to which major text analytical approaches are advisable to follow in a pre-college setting. The present theoretical research aims to address this lacuna. Respectively, the purpose of this pedagogically motivated theoretical paper is to investigate two major approaches of ESP text analysis, the register and the genre analysis, in order to find the more suitable one for exploring the language use of secondary school subject texts from the point of view of an English as a second language teacher. Comparing and contrasting the merits and limitations of the two contrastive approaches allows for a better understanding of the nature of the two different perspectives of text analysis. The study examines the goals, the scope of analysis, and the achievements of the register perspective and those of the genre approach alike. The paper also investigates and reviews in detail the starkly different methods of ESP text analysis applied by the two perspectives. Discovering text analysis from a theoretical and methodological angle supports a practical aspect of English teaching, namely making an informed choice when setting out to analyse texts in English. It can be concluded from the literature that the register perspective yields more readily applicable data of text analysis for ESL teachers instructing in a pre-college environment. Besides teachers working in bilingual secondary school, the pedagogical conclusions of the study are also useful for teachers instructing in international secondary schools where the language of education is English and the alumni comprise non-native students.","subject":"English for Special Purposes, Content Analysis, Textbook Evaluation, Textbook Content, Language Usage, Secondary Education, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Language of Instruction, Discourse Analysis, Literary Genres","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1084413","title":"Building Innovative Online Korean and Japanese Courses: A Pilot on Technology-Enhanced Curriculum Development","author":"Sato, Eriko, Sohn, Heejeong, Chen, Julian ChengChiang, Adebowale, Kayode C.

This has been referred to as the 21st century paradox. As one solution to this problem, we propose to integrate entrepreneurship in the CIS curriculum. An analysis of N = 253 universities in the United States finds that only 39.5% offer both CIS and entrepreneurship degrees. Large, private, research-oriented universities were found to be most likely to offer both degrees. A follow-up qualitative analysis of eight ABET accredited IS programs in business schools that also offer a full-time entrepreneurship degree finds that only one university gives students the option to take one entrepreneurship class as part of their IS major. We propose to infuse entrepreneurship in CIS classes based on the lean startup methodology and offer a learn-build-measure feedback loop, along with open source software and agile development practices, as a pedagogical framework for instructors. The paper concludes with a discussion of how entrepreneurship in the CIS curriculum creates graduates that are better prepared to enter the job market.","subject":"Entrepreneurship, Computer Science Education, Information Systems, College Curriculum, Integrated Curriculum, Business Administration Education, Universities, Qualitative Research, Accreditation (Institutions), Business Schools","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1137358","title":"Assessing Cyberbullying in Higher Education","author":"Kamali, Ali","description":"This project aims to expose information educators to various aspects of cyberbullying for the purpose of policy development in an environment of higher education. The preponderance of nation-wide research on cyberbullying is concentrated on adolescents; such efforts in college campuses are limited to individual endeavors. Cyberbullying research on college campuses lacks a unified definition of the concept. Although the states mandated most school districts to develop and enact some sort of policy, the law is silent on the college level cyberbullying. According to the literature, &quot;cyberbullying&quot; is reserved for adolescents; however, &quot;cyber-harassment&quot; or &quot;cyberstalking&quot; are related to adults. While cyberbullying shares with conventional bullying intimidation, aggression, and harm, it is unique because (1) the encounter is not face-to-face; (2) the perpetrator can employ varied means (e.g., cellphones, texts, blogs, Internet, social media, etc.); and (3) the act can be undisclosed. The data was collected from a random sample of 511 students (out of a student population of approximately 6,000) in a Midwestern town by employing self-administered questionnaire. It was found that engagement with different social network groups and online communications with those with questionable identity are good predictor of increased vulnerability to the risks of being victimized. The data suggests being victimized leads to victimization. Although males differ from females in terms of the type and the extent of cyberbullying, no significant difference was found among the categories of student status or their class ranks.","subject":"Higher Education, College Students, Bullying, Computer Mediated Communication, Adolescents, Social Media, Telecommunications, Questionnaires, Predictor Variables, Victims, At Risk Persons, Gender Differences, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis, Student Characteristics","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1137356","title":"Adding Value: Online Student Engagement","author":"Everett, Donna R.","description":"This paper seeks to add to the emerging literature related to online student engagement with additional suggestions for instructional strategies.

The main social media tools used in instruction were Facebook, blogs, Twitter, and YouTube. Although a majority of studies reported positive attitudes by students regarding academic applications of Web 2.0 technologies, faculty views were more tepid and reserved. Transgression of &quot;socializing&quot; during academic interactivity, privacy issues, and data overload were the major drawbacks noted by students. Faculty were most concerned about the vast breadth of social media modalities and the lack of training support in emerging interactive-mobile technology.

This study examined learning styles and the perceived benefits of analogical problem construction on SQL knowledge acquisition. The data collected from 80 participants suggests there is a perceived positive benefit to using analogical problem construction for learning introductory database concepts. The learning style of the majority of students in the sample is &quot;Active-Sensing-Visual-Sequential.&quot; However, learning styles were not related to student perceived impact of analogical problem construction to understand database concepts. Student analogies were collected for a variety of SQL concepts; noteworthy examples are highlighted. While results related to learning styles are intriguing, the most promising path for further exploration (for both research and practice) is the use of analogy problem construction in Information Systems educational environments.","subject":"Cognitive Style, Databases, Information Systems, Information Science, Problem Solving, Teaching Methods, Prior Learning, Student Attitudes, Concept Formation, Transfer of Training, Logical Thinking, College Students, Questionnaires, Statistical Analysis","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1077768","title":"The Impact of Student Expectations in Using Instructional Tools on Student Engagement: A Look through the Expectation Disconfirmation Theory Lens","author":"Schwarz, Colleen, Zhu, Zhiwei","description":"With increasing class sizes, faculty have increasingly been using online homework software (OHS) and in-person discussion groups as the classroom evolves. We sought to determine the effect of online homework software and in-person discussion groups on student engagement. Specifically, we posited that expectations influence this relationship, and we applied Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) to determine whether a student's expectations about discussion groups or OHS impacts Student Engagement. Moreover, with EDT, we assessed whether these impacts are direct. Our results indicate that if instructors facilitate the development of expectations when students work in groups in a class, the student's level of group satisfaction in addition to engagement in the course will be positively influenced. However, the findings indicate that OHS exerts differing effects. When instructors focus on developing realistic expectations about the OHS used in class they will achieve greater satisfaction with the technology. This satisfaction with the technology will then lead to student engagement in the course. This exploratory study, in spite of a few limitations, demonstrates the importance of managing expectations in the classroom, and its impact on current educational tools. The study also identifies additional research questions on expectation management relating to student engagement that would reduce the impact of these limitations.","subject":"Learner Engagement, Expectation, Computer Uses in Education, Computer Software, Homework, Discussion Groups, Student Satisfaction, Structural Equation Models, Student Surveys, Undergraduate Students","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1072621","title":"Bringing Business Intelligence to Health Information Technology Curriculum","author":"Zheng, Guangzhi, Zhang, Chi, Li, Lei","description":"Business intelligence (BI) and healthcare analytics are the emerging technologies that provide analytical capability to help healthcare industry improve service quality, reduce cost, and manage risks. However, such component on analytical healthcare data processing is largely missed from current healthcare information technology (HIT) or health informatics (HI) curricula. In this paper, we took an initial step to fill this gap. We investigated the current HIT educational programs, BI industry, and healthcare BI job listings, and students' perceptions of BI and how BI could be incorporated into HIT programs. The student survey results showed strong interests from students in a HIT course containing BI components or a BI course specialized in the healthcare context. Based on the student survey and investigation of BI industry and job market, as well as HIT educational programs, we developed a general curriculum framework and exemplar implementation strategies to demonstrate how BI can be incorporated into an HI or HIT program. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first of its kind. Our approach of integrating information from students, the HIT industry and other HIT programs can also be used as a model for general HIT curriculum development and improvement.","subject":"Business, Intelligence, Information Technology, Curriculum, Student Attitudes, Industry, Student Surveys, Health Services, Costs, Risk Management, Employment Opportunities, Guidelines, Curriculum Development, Educational Improvement, Computer Science Education, Information Systems, Information Science, Interdisciplinary Approach, Undergraduate Students, Graduate Students","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1120994","title":"Mental Hygienic Aspects of Animal Assisted Education","author":"Tak\u00e1cs, Istv\u00e1n, Szalai, Katalin","description":"The Institution for Special Education at the Faculty of Pedagogic of the University of Kaposv\u00e1r has been engaged in animal assisted activities for about three years.

The primary focus of our research was the development (and examination) of memory; however, observations with ethological and mental hygiene angles were a natural segment of our work. A significant part of the observations pointed to factors that both the children and their educators have experienced: the acceptance of each other, an increased level of tolerance, and an increased attention level towards the partner (human and animal). The teachers gave account of their respective observations in a small conference at the end of the last school year. Researches were offered a glimpse into the unique world of the relationship between a part of &quot;living nature&quot;--the pygmy rabbit in our case--and humans. During the 12 sessions of the training our colleagues have made observations that could serve as basis for a new system of paradigms of animal assisted pedagogics in the future.

Thus, organizations are increasingly seeking managers with knowledge of value chain related to mobile-oriented business activities, usually referred to as mobile commerce (m-commerce). Accordingly, business management schools are interesting in designing their curricula to respond to the need for m-commerce knowledge and, in particular, the scope of the content for an m-commerce course. The general conception of m-commerce is that it is a component of e-business or e-commerce. This paper presents the unique dimensions of m-commerce that makes it stand out as a separate course for postgraduate business management students. This paper also provides input in regard to the design and delivery of the course by drawing upon the recent teaching experience of the authors at a highly respected business school in India. The course design covers mobility-related technology elements as related to business in diverse industry segments and is expected to enable students to develop a suitable mobile strategy for a real-time business scenario. The course content was drawn primarily from research papers, industry reports, and examples of trending mobile applications. The pedagogy was a blend of lectures and classroom exercises on innovative case studies. The response of the students to the course indicated a high degree of satisfaction in regard to its relevance. The inputs provided in this paper are believed to serve as guidance to business management schools that are interested developing such a course.","subject":"Management Development, Business Administration Education, Business Schools, Teaching Experience, Foreign Countries, Telecommunications, Curriculum Design, Graduate Students, Course Descriptions, Industry, Course Content, Teaching Methods, Lecture Method, Case Studies, Student Attitudes, Handheld Devices, Information Technology","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"India"},{"id":"EJ1121037","title":"Compulsory Book Reading at School and within Leisure","author":"Pavlovic, Slavica","description":"This paper deals with attitudes of secondary school pupils towards compulsory book reading at school, being the integral part of the subject Croat language and literature teaching subject, and its possible impact on their book (not-)reading in their leisure time.

It was also observable in the case of those living at higher living standards that they take fetus-protecting vitamins with a significantly higher frequency before the pregnancy than those living at lower living standards. According to our research data, 67% of the sample developed aneamia. In our research the risk group consisted of young, vegetarian expectant mothers with low education and the multiparas. After conception, the timing of gynaecological consultation was appropriate and the majority of the sample had a clear idea of the ways of preventing aneamia. However, prevention was only realized in practice--based on the criteria--only with a frequency of 12%. It would be important to consciously plan pregnancy. After taking expectant mothers into care, they should--as soon as possible--be screened for the deficiency and in need, supplements should be started. Risk groups should be given greater attention. In their case, a routine supplement of iron would be desirable even before the development of a deficiency. During pregnancy care, awareness must be raised and an iron-rich diet should be established at the beginning.

Data were collected about the students' career decision self-efficiency experiences, their personality traits and also about the question how they see their future profession. Based on our results the students who had a definite idea of their future professional career even during their studies and were determined with improved professional and personal competencies during the training made up a distinct group and were more dedicated to their career. On the basis of our analyses it was empirically proved that the training types which provide opportunities for the conscious monitoring of personal and professional competencies by encouraging the student with their career adjustment are of great significance.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Career Choice, Higher Education, Occupational Aspiration, Questionnaires, Self Efficacy, Personality Traits, Expectation, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation, Educational Attainment, Parent Background, Self Concept Measures, Decision Making, Vocational Maturity, Personality Measures, Goal Orientation, College Students","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"id":"EJ1121045","title":"The Main Motivations of Ukrainian Students Who Choose to Study in Poland","author":"Rebisz, Slawomir, Sikora, Ilona","description":"Students' educational migration is one of the phenomena characteristic of the globalization processes.

In fact, we set out to find an answer to the question &quot;What made foreign students from Ukraine leave their country and why did they choose to study in Poland?&quot; To find our answers we conducted questionnaire interviews on a random purposive sample of foreign students from Ukraine (N = 83).

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search.

In this survey 198 undergraduate students of BBS were examined by the Aspiration Index questionnaire in order to determine the pattern of extrinsic and intrinsic life goals in their personality, to find relationship between personal background-factors and these aspirations, and to compare the attitudes of the young population to a less homogenous reference group. Compared with the reference group, young women of BBS find all goals more important, except for social commitment and general intrinsic aspiration. Both BBS female and male students were found more materialistic. The materialistic attitudes are significantly stronger among the students of business programs, but not among the students of humanities (andragogy). In conclusion, the students of BBS tend to accept more extrinsic life goals than members of the external reference group. These attitudes are influenced by the generational properties of this young population and by the educational program they attend (business or humanities). The extrinsic attitudes do not serve the individuals' personal development or happiness; neither do they serve the interests of society. The new paradigms of the future business world are not yet interiorized.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Business Schools, Mental Health, Undergraduate Students, Aspiration, Student Surveys, Personality, Background, Student Attitudes, Comparative Analysis, Gender Differences, Humanities, Questionnaires, Student Characteristics","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary (Budapest)"},{"id":"EJ1121028","title":"Communication and Reception in Teaching: The Age of Image &quot;versus&quot; the &quot;Weight&quot; of Words","author":"Bradea, Adela","description":"Contemporary culture is mainly a culture of image. We get our information seeing. Examination of images is free, while reading is impelled by the necessity of browsing the whole text. The image seems more appropriate than the text when trying to communicate easy and quickly. The speech calls for articulated language, expressed through a symbolic set of oral or written codes that we must master. Understanding an image requires less work and fewer skills than reading a text. This paper aims to highlight how messages are perceived and received within the educational activities, through the two types of communication, iconic and logical-linguistic. The instrument used in conducting the research was represented by a questionnaire consisting from objective and subjective items, applied to students from high schools in Oradea. Besides these questionnaires, a key role in the study was played by the knowledge gained while observing lessons held by students of the University of Oradea within their teaching placement, as well as while supervising teachers from secondary educational institutions in the process of obtaining teacher certification level 1. The obtained results prove that the majority of investigated students prefer the combination of two types of communication in teaching.","subject":"High School Students, Learning Modalities, Visual Learning, Questionnaires, Intermode Differences, Interpersonal Communication, Learning Activities, Teaching Methods, Preferences, Cognitive Style, Educational Practices, Foreign Countries","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Romania"},{"id":"EJ1121026","title":"The Impact of Pedagogical Agent on Learners' Motivation and Academic Success","author":"Dincer, Serkan, Doganay, Ahmet","description":"Pedagogical agent is generally described as educational programs that guide, motivate learners while encouraging them during learning by providing feedback. The tasks (informative, guiding, or friend, etc.) and types (human-like, cartoon character, audio, text, etc.) of these modules can be classified based on various variables. Although computer-assisted instruction software is commonly used as a teaching material, research on modules integrated on such programs is scarce. Studies in the field have revealed that such computer-assisted instruction programs increase motivation of learners. In order to keep motivation levels high, these programs need to be adopted depending on the individual needs. Therefore, it can be beneficial to integrate software designed that can be personalized. In this respect, the present study was conducted with secondary school students to identify the impact of pedagogical agent on learners' academic success and motivation. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed. The first group received education via fixed pedagogical agent, the second group had the option to choose among several pedagogical agents, the third group received the education without pedagogical agent and finally the last group received the same education through traditional (non-computer) way. This four-week program was introduced to students via MS Excel program and the data was gathered as pre- and post-test method. The findings have revealed that interfaces impacted motivation and accordingly academic success in a positive way. As a result of the study, it is suggested that learners should be provided programs that can be personalized depending on learners' needs and preferences.","subject":"Student Motivation, Academic Achievement, Computer Assisted Instruction, Pretests Posttests, Pilot Projects, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Statistical Analysis, Secondary School Students, Grade 5, Grade 8","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1121046","title":"Organization of Physical Activities as a Precondition of Quality Development of Motor Abilities of Pre-School and School Children","author":"Markovic, \u017divorad, Kopas-Vuka\u0161inovic, Emina","description":"In their work authors consider the significance of the organization of physical activities for the development of abilities of pre-school and school children. Led by theoretical basis that physical development of children represents the basis of their whole development, and that &quot;fine motor skills&quot; are determined by the development of its large motorics, the authors point to the significance of the content and structure of physical education programme in preschool institutions and younger age school classes. It is evident that the effects of cultivating of children development during preschool period can be seen in younger primary school classes. The goal of this research was to determine if and how much the different organization of preparatory part of physical education lesson for younger school children, determines the differences in the development of their motor abilities. By the use of experimental method, the effects of prolonged preparatory part of a lesson in younger school classes. This part was realized through complex of exercises which were supposed to have influence on transformation of motor abilities in relation to the structure with standard duration of certain parts of a lesson. It is determined that certain increase in body movement of students during physical activity can significantly contribute to better development of motor abilities. These abilities determine correct physical development and strengthening of health, which determines general aim of physical education.","subject":"Psychomotor Skills, Physical Activities, Preschool Children, Physical Activity Level, Physical Education, Foreign Countries, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Statistical Analysis, Elementary School Students","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Serbia"},{"id":"EJ1120992","title":"Hungarian Dimensions of Physical Activity Based on Studies at School Ages","author":"Cselik, Bence, Szmodis, M\u00e1rta, Szots, G\u00e1bor, \u00c1cs, Pongr\u00e1c","description":"It is an old pursuit to find the balance between nature and society (within the individual and the sum of people). In order to talk about a healthy society, it is necessary to have the people making up the society healthy, too. The health condition of the individuals affects the society, creating a close connection among individuals and society. Health, mental and physical well-beings of members of society affects the economy, since a healthy workforce leads to developing economy, which hence can provide the requirements and conditions that ensure a mentally and physically healthy way of living for the society. Sport, everyday exercise, therefore regular training can also play an important social role, and can greatly contribute to social well-being. Decreased physical activity, sitting lifestyle are both specific traits of economically developed countries, and turns into a more and more threatening public health problem world-wide, which contribute to the development or aggravation of such chronic diseases and health damages, like morbid obesity, heart diseases, diabetes, hypertension, locomotor diseases, malignant tumors, and depression. The topic of our research is related to mainly the subject of primary school healthcare programs. The measurements have been taken in 12 different educational institutions, which included primary, secondary, vocational schools, and a 6-grade school. The actuality of the topic is proven by the increased obesity appearing at more younger ages, and we intend to shed some light on the fact that with a good healthcare strategy and short-term goals we can achieve positive results shortly on the fields of school healthcare.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Physical Activity Level, Physical Activities, School Health Services, Elementary School Students, Health Programs, Experimental Groups, Control Groups, Obesity, Disease Incidence, Cohort Analysis, Age Differences, Intervention, Health Promotion, Health Conditions, Health Related Fitness, Gender Differences, Institutional Characteristics, Questionnaires, Student Surveys, Predictor Variables, Secondary School Students, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Hungary"},{"id":"EJ1121020","title":"Telemetry Option in the Measurement of Physical Activity for Patients with Heart Failure","author":"Melczer, Csaba, Melczer, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Ol\u00e1h, Andr\u00e1s, S\u00e9lleyn\u00e9-Gy\u00far\u00f3, M\u00f3nika, Welker, Zsanett, \u00c1cs, Pongr\u00e1c","description":"Measurement of physical activity among patients with heart failure typically requires a special approach due to the patients' physical status. Nowadays, a technology is already available that can measure the kinematic movements in 3-D by a pacemaker and implantable defibrillator giving an assessment on software. The telemetry data can be transmitted to a central system. The research aims to elaborate the methods that help to compare of the data concerning physical activity both built-in an accelerometer in Cardiac Resychrinisation Therapy (CRT) devices and data obtained from an external Actigraph GT3XE-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor. 5 persons participated in the pilot study (n = 5); mean age: 57 \u00b1 13.37; BMI: 90.6 \u00b1 7.63. The Actigraph data from CRT device were examined in a 6-day-interval, between February 28 and March 5, 2014. The investigation started conducting a 6-minute walking test and continued with the measurement of daily physical activity. For data analysis descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used. It is clear from the data obtained from Actigraph that the MET values (mean: 1.17 \u00b1 0.096) of the patients in the sample were extremely low due to their disease. However, some patients with higher physical activity than average (1.26; 1.28) seemed to be noteworthy, but they showed lower performance than healthy people. The physical activity of the patients during the 6-minute walking test corresponded to 1.9-2.48 MET. The physical activity of patients was found typically in the &quot;light or moderate range&quot; classifying the physical activity by Actigraph. Data from Actigraph are accurate and detailed making the physical activity of the patients measurable and appreciable. The results of the 6-minute walking test were in the category from moderate to very vigorous for individualized moderate physical performance based on Actigraph. It indicates the individual performance differences among patients. However, the daily physical performance is even lower than that of the 6-minute walking. We can conclude from the data related to the percentage of the average activity in CRT system to the average energy consumption and the improvement in the patients' physical condition. Due to the limitations of the sampling frequency the different time intervals cannot be isolated in the different intensity ranges. Therefore, the percentage of the data of physical activity provided by the device may have a limited use.","subject":"Physical Activities, Patients, Heart Disorders, Equipment, Physical Activity Level, Regression (Statistics), Quality of Life, Measurement, Statistical Analysis","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
