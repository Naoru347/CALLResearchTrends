Games are said, amongst others, to be motivating, to lower affective barriers in learning, and to encourage foreign or second language (L2) interaction. But how do learners actually experience the use of games? What impact does gameplay have on students' perceptions of themselves as learners, and how does this affect their learning practice? These questions are important as they are likely to influence the success of digital gamebased language learning, and as a result the way teachers might integrate games into the curriculum. In this study we investigated the experiences of five students who had participated in a fifteen-week game-based learning program at a university in Thailand. We conducted six interviews with each of them (for a total of 30 interviews) to identify what impact gameplay had in particular on their willingness to communicate in English (MacIntyre, D\u00f6rnyei, Cl\u00e9ment &amp; Noels, 1998). The results showed that gameplay had a number of benefits for the participants in this study, in particular in terms of lowering their affective barriers to learning and increasing their willingness to communicate. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of further research and classroom practice.","subject":"Educational Games, Educational Technology, Teaching Methods, Student Attitudes, Interviews, College Students, English (Second Language), Barriers, Foreign Countries, Second Language Learning","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Thailand"},{"id":"EJ1059672","title":"English Learning Websites and Digital Resources from the Perspective of Chinese University EFL Practitioners","author":"Shen, Huizhong, Yuan, Yifeng, Ewing, Robyn","description":"English language learning (ELL) websites and digital resources have been recognized as an important source of linguistic and cultural knowledge for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners to explore. The up-to-date information carried by authentic materials is invaluable for learners to develop an understanding of the target language\/culture. However, there appears to be a gap between what the designer intends and what the user wants. This paper investigates Chinese university EFL teachers' perceptions of online English language websites and resources. The study focuses on a number of components of major language areas and skills in ELL websites, website materials, language users' preferences, and website usability. A total of 1519 English academics from 139 universities across China completed the online survey, and 164 of them voluntarily participated in focus group interviews anonymously. The empirical evidence of this study has highlighted that a pedagogically-oriented ELL website, targeting audiences with a variety of language proficiencies, was much liked by the Chinese EFL teachers. A preference was observed to see more current authentic language, examination-oriented English learning materials and tasks, and Eastern\/non-Anglophone topics in the websites. In addition, it is found that website usability is another key factor that would impact ELL website popularity. A well-designed ELL website can effectively assist Chinese EFL learners to enhance their language competence and achieve optimal learning outcomes. This study provides a context-specific empirical base for innovative web-based EFL learning and teaching as well as website design and materials development in China. The proposed key features of a preferred ELL website may help better inform website designers, content writers and evaluators in their ELL website design\/evaluation.","subject":"Asians, Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), Web Sites, College Faculty, Teacher Attitudes, Usability, Online Surveys, Focus Groups, Interviews, Cultural Awareness, Educational Resources, Universities, Foreign Countries, Language Proficiency, Outcomes of Education, Second Language Instruction, Innovation, Material Development, Evaluators","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"China"},{"id":"EJ1074878","title":"Using Key Part-of-Speech Analysis to Examine Spoken Discourse by Taiwanese EFL Learners","author":"Lin, Yen-Liang","description":"This study reports on a corpus analysis of samples of spoken discourse between a group of British and Taiwanese adolescents, with the aim of exploring the statistically significant differences in the use of grammatical categories between the two groups of participants. The key word method extended to a part-of-speech level using the web-based corpus analytical tool, &quot;Wmatrix,&quot; highlights those linguistic domains which deserve particular attention. Specifically, it reveals the lexical and grammatical categories that occur unusually frequently or unusually infrequently in the English learners' discourse when compared with the language used by the native speakers of English in the sample. The research findings delineate the pedagogical merit of key domain analysis and thus help to inform English as a foreign language teachers and materials developers in the design of courses emphasising spoken interaction.","subject":"Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Discourse Analysis, Computational Linguistics, Grammar, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Material Development, Language Teachers, English, Native Speakers, Cross Cultural Studies","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan, United Kingdom"},{"id":"EJ1059679","title":"Website Analysis in an EFL Context: Content Comprehension, Perceptions on Web Usability and Awareness of Reading Strategies","author":"Roy, Debopriyo, Crabbe, Stephen","description":"Website analysis is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that focuses on both digital literacy and language competence (Brugger, 2009). Website analysis in an EFL learning context has the potential to facilitate logical thinking and in the process develop functional language proficiency. This study reported on an English language website (http:\/\/www.travelbelize.org\/) analysis experiment carried out for three weeks as an in-class and homework activity in a third year (junior) level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) course at a Japanese technical university. The purpose was to explore EFL learners' ability to analyze an English language website and produce concrete design responses in English. During the first week of the analysis (involving sixteen students selected due to performing the best during earlier in-class website analysis activities on the course), participants produced their own responses to eight open-ended design questions about the website. The second week of the analysis (involving all 59 students on the course) tested the students' ability to search for information from the website, and recorded their impressions about the website design based on standard usability questionnaires (&quot;CSUQ,&quot; &quot;QUIS,&quot; and &quot;MPRC&quot;). The third week of the analysis had the 59 students self-report on their use of meta-cognitive reading strategies (&quot;MARSI 1.0 Questionnaire&quot;) during the website analysis. The results of the questionnaires showed that, overall, the EFL students had a basic understanding of major design questions related to information organization, screen interface design, audience, technology used, etc. However, there was statistically significant variability between responses in different groups (comprehensive evaluation, webpage design, terminology and website information and website capabilities) and the respondents were not unanimous in their impressions about the website. The result of the student self-reports on metacognitive reading strategies showed wide acceptability and use of problem-solving strategies.","subject":"Web Sites, Second Language Learning, English (Second Language), Reading Strategies, Logical Thinking, Language Proficiency, Student Attitudes, Questionnaires, Usability, Metacognition, Problem Solving, Technological Literacy, Audiences, Computer Assisted Instruction, Foreign Countries","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Japan"},{"id":"EJ1059671","title":"Language Learner Perspectives on the Functionality and Use of Electronic Language Dictionaries","author":"Levy, Mike, Steel, Caroline","description":"This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of &quot;usability&quot; and &quot;functionality,&quot; these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n = 587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel &amp; Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students' comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Dictionaries, Electronic Publishing, Surveys, Student Attitudes, Language Enrollment, Usability, College Students, Statistical Analysis, Qualitative Research, Telecommunications, Classification","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1074883","title":"Attitudes towards Online Feedback on Writing: Why Students Mistrust the Learning Potential of Models","author":"Strobl, Carola","description":"This exploratory study sheds new light on students' perceptions of online feedback types for a complex writing task, summary writing from spoken input in a foreign language (L2), and investigates how these correlate with their actual learning to write. Students tend to favour clear-cut, instructivist rather than constructivist feedback, and guided self-evaluation through model solutions in online learning environments. However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress. This dichotomy was found to originate in a mismatch between their expectations towards the online learning module and the characteristics of the constructivist feedback conveyed. This mismatch can be attributed to three key factors: (1) evaluation, (2) linguistic focus, and (3) learner motivation.","subject":"Feedback (Response), Writing (Composition), Constructivism (Learning), Computer Mediated Communication, Student Attitudes, Writing Attitudes, Second Language Learning, Correlation, Writing Instruction, Trust (Psychology), Models, Undergraduate Students, Bachelors Degrees, Applied Linguistics, Problem Solving, Ability, Cognitive Development, Educational Benefits, Pretests Posttests, Intervention, Electronic Learning, Learning Modules, Writing Exercises, Self Evaluation (Individuals), Comparative Analysis, Learning Motivation, Blended Learning","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1074890","title":"Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) in L2 Oral Proficiency Development: A Meta-Analysis","author":"Lin, Huifen","description":"The ever growing interest in the development of foreign or second (L2) oral proficiency in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) classroom has resulted in a large body of studies looking at both the direct and indirect effects of CMC interventions on the acquisition of oral competences. The present study employed a quantitative meta-analytic approach to investigate such effects by synthesizing (quasi)experimental studies that provide empirical quantitative data for effect size calculation. A literature search located 25 relevant studies for the final analysis. Each study was independently coded for learner, design and publication characteristics. The averaged effect size was estimated from the included studies. The results of the meta-analysis reveal that communication mediated by computer\/technologies produced a moderate positive effect on L2 learners' oral proficiency compared to face-to-face (F2F) communication or no interaction. Furthermore, CMC has roughly similar effect on pronunciation, lexical and syntactic level of oral production; however, it might have a negative impact on fluency and accuracy. This meta-analysis also found that the effect of CMC on oral proficiency depends on several methodological factors such as task type, outcome measurement, treatment length, and assessment task. Major findings of the current meta-analysis include: (1) studies relying on elicited data are superior to those utilizing naturalistic data; (2) reading aloud seems to be the task that could elicit the best oral performance from students; (3) surprisingly, CMC appeared to be harmful for accuracy and fluency; (4) studies that employed decision-making generated the largest effect size, followed by studies that used more than one task type; (5) among the four tasks, jigsaw actually generated a negative effect on oral performance; and (6) as the most popular task employed by primary researchers, opinion-exchange studies produced the smallest effect size. These findings need to be interpreted as exploratory rather than confirmatory since each of them became less trustworthy after taking into consideration numerous other factors such as CMC task and the particular CMC tool used, etc. Future research suggestions are provided and the limitations of this meta-analysis are addressed.","subject":"Computer Mediated Communication, Second Language Learning, Oral Language, Language Proficiency, Intervention, Meta Analysis, Quasiexperimental Design, Effect Size, Literature Reviews, Achievement Gains, Data, Reading Aloud to Others, Accuracy, Reading Fluency, Decision Making, Task Analysis, Competence, Statistical Analysis","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
