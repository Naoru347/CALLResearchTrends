This study employs a situated learning approach to teacher training and explores what online teaching skills emerge in the process of collaborative situated learning, how these skills develop, and whether collaborative situated learning is an effective method of training instructors to teach in 3D VWs. Six English as a second language (ESL) teacher trainees enrolled in the Teaching English as a Second\/Foreign Language (TES\/FL) program participated in the study. During the preteaching stage, teacher trainees developed language tasks to implement during the teaching stage with eight EFL students in 3D VWs. Blackboard wikis used for designing tasks allowed for observing the acquisition of five 3D-specific, integrated skills. The analysis of teaching sessions recorded through screen capturing software Camtasia Relay in conjunction with the teacher trainees' wikis and journals demonstrates that for this group of teachers, a situated learning approach was an effective method of teacher training.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Teacher Education, Educational Technology, Virtual Classrooms, Online Courses, Teaching Skills, Cooperative Learning, Skill Development, Preservice Teachers, Technology Uses in Education, Computer Software, Web Sites, Web 2.0 Technologies, Context Effect, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Content Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Canada, Turkey"},{"id":"EJ1075830","title":"Digital Mindsets: Teachers' Technology Use in Personal Life and Teaching","author":"Tour, Ekaterina","description":"Over the last few years there have been important calls for new literacies to become an integral part of language education. Yet traditional approaches to technology continue to persist in many contexts. Although the role of teachers in this problem has been acknowledged, little is known about how teachers' everyday digital literacy practices influence teaching with technologies. Informed by Literacy Studies, the paper reports the findings from a larger qualitative study and explores the relationship between technology use in personal and professional domains of three language teachers. The study found that the participants' digital mindsets, comprising assumptions about affordances of digital technologies, shaped the ways in which the participants used digital technologies within and beyond classrooms. New literacies required creative and elaborated assumptions about affordances; however, these understandings had different significance for the participants. The article explains why teaching new literacies continues to be challenging and suggests implications for teachers' professional learning and education and language pedagogy.","subject":"Media Literacy, Technology Uses in Education, Beliefs, Language Teachers, Teaching Styles, Educational Practices, Individual Characteristics, Teacher Characteristics, Case Studies, Elementary Secondary Education, Interviews, Mass Media Use, Use Studies, Teacher Attitudes, Foreign Countries, Photography","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1063815","title":"Contextual EFL Learning in a 3D Virtual Environment","author":"Lan, Yu-Ju","description":"The purposes of the current study are to develop virtually immersive EFL learning contexts for EFL learners in Taiwan to pre- and review English materials beyond the regular English class schedule. A 2-iteration action research lasting for one semester was conducted to evaluate the effects of virtual contexts on learners' EFL learning. 132 elementary school students participated in this study. Both qualitative and quantitative data, including observation and English learning performances, were collected and analyzed. The positive results obtained from the study approved that the usage of virtual contexts in EFL learning could (1) provide students with learning opportunities without the time and space limits, (2) provide students with a game-liked scenario for English learning, and (3) enhance learners' EFL performances. The learning mode proposed and experiences gained in the current study not only serve as a practical reference to diverse foreign language educational occasions but also add to the knowledge pool of foreign language learning and teaching in virtual worlds.","subject":"Foreign Countries, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Computer Assisted Instruction, Action Research, Observation, Elementary School Students, Language Tests, Teaching Methods, Problem Solving","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1051671","title":"Rethinking Transfer: Learning from CALL Teacher Education as Consequential Transition","author":"Chao, Chin-chi","description":"Behind CALL teacher education (CTE) there is an unproblematized consensus of transfer, which suggests a positivist and tool-centered view of learning gains that differs from the sociocultural focus of recent teacher education research. Drawing on Beach's (2003) conceptualization of transfer as &quot;consequential transition,&quot; this qualitative study seeks a cross-contextual understanding of language teacher learning with digital technology as the teachers in this study moved from a CTE course back to their own teaching contexts. Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching. These results challenge the view that transfer in CTE must be about using technology. It is suggested that a focus on critical reflection of technology use may encourage teachers to continue reflective engagement in the ever-changing and complicated digital learning and teaching context.","subject":"Language Teachers, Teacher Education Programs, Praxis, Theory Practice Relationship, Transfer of Training, Interviews, Followup Studies, Graduate Surveys, Technology Uses in Education, Achievement Gains, Sociocultural Patterns, Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Educational Practices, Learning Experience, Multimedia Instruction, Multimedia Materials, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Inservice Teacher Education, Graduate Students, Comparative Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Transcripts (Written Records), Technological Literacy, Technology Education, Teaching Methods, Teaching Skills, Foreign Countries, Educational Technology, Qualitative Research, Computer Assisted Instruction","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1063800","title":"Facilitating Participation: Teacher Roles in a Multiuser Virtual Learning Environment","author":"Wang, Airong","description":"This paper reports on a task-based language teaching course in Second Life. The data set consists of transcribed recordings and a teacher interview. Focusing on how the teacher facilitated student participation, this paper aims to explore the discourse functions in the teacher language output and then to address the teacher roles in three different task phases. All the turns produced by the teacher and the students were counted, the teacher language output in the recordings was classified into 19 discourse function categories, and then all the discourse functions were classified into six teacher roles. The results show that the during-task phase was student output oriented. This study reveals that in the pre-task phase the teacher used the largest number of types and tokens of discourse functions, and played a significant technical and social role. In the during-task phase, the teacher focused on motivating students to participate, monitoring student activities, and providing task support. In the post-task phase, the teacher was a language guide. While the teacher roles that were most prominent varied in the three task phases, the teacher was found to play four roles consistently in the three task phases: monitor role, motivator role, language guide role, and social role.","subject":"Virtual Classrooms, Teacher Role, Student Participation, Discourse Analysis, Undergraduate Students, Business English, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), College Faculty, Interviews, English Teachers, Foreign Countries","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Sweden"},{"id":"EJ1051723","title":"Learning to Identify and Actualize Affordances in a New Tool","author":"Haines, Karen J.","description":"Keeping abreast of new technologies and the opportunities they offer is a challenge for inservice teachers (Blake, 2008; Egbert, Akasha, Huff, &amp; Lee, 2011; Hanson-Smith, 2006; Hubbard, 2007; Robb, 2006). An important aspect of teacher learning about the use of technology is the ability to identify the affordances of new tools and how they can support learning in the language classroom (Hampel &amp; Stickler, 2005; Kessler, 2010). This fourteen-month-long longitudinal study of the learning of two experienced foreign language teachers working together describes how their perceptions of the affordances of two computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools developed over time. Interview data collected over three semesters demonstrated how teachers' perceptions of affordance evolve through classroom practice with technology, and how such perceptions might be transferred to the use of a new tool. As well, although the two teachers used the same tools (blogs and wikis) in the same courses and, at times, with the same classes, they perceived different learning affordances in relation to the language learning processes they prioritized. The article will conclude with suggestions for ways in which a better understanding of affordance in teacher knowledge development has implications for the support of in-service language teachers' learning.","subject":"Educational Technology, Longitudinal Studies, Second Language Instruction, Language Teachers, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Attitudes, Teaching Methods, Second Language Learning, Electronic Publishing, Web Sites, Case Studies, Interviews, Italian, Foreign Countries, College Faculty, Adult Students","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1051684","title":"Promoting Pre-Service Teachers' Reflections through a Cross-Cultural Keypal Project","author":"Wach, Aleksandra","description":"This paper reports the results of an action research-based study that investigated participants' reflections on EFL learning and teaching in a computer-mediated communication (CMC)-based project.

In writing, truly immediate feedback is impractical, but computer-assisted feedback provides a quick way of providing feedback that also reduces the teacher's workload. We explored the accuracy of feedback from Criterion\u00ae, a program developed by Educational Testing Service, and students' responses to it. Thirty-two students received feedback from Criterion on four essays throughout a semester, with 16 receiving the feedback immediately and 16 receiving it several days after writing their essays. Results indicated that 75% of the error codes were correct, but that Criterion missed many language errors. Students responded to the correct error codes 73% of the time and responded to more of the codes over the course of the semester, while the condition--delayed versus immediate--did not affect their response rates nor their accuracy on the first drafts. Although we cannot support claims that immediate feedback may be more helpful, we believe that, with proper training, Criterion can help students correct certain aspects of language.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computer Assisted Instruction, Accuracy, Feedback (Response), Student Attitudes, Teaching Methods, Essays, Error Correction, Writing Instruction, Faculty Workload, Computer Software, Instructional Effectiveness, Academic Discourse, English (Second Language), Language Tests, College Students, Foreign Students, Revision (Written Composition)","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1075828","title":"Using Facebook to Promote Korean EFL Learners' Intercultural Competence","author":"Jin, Seunghee","description":"Foreign language learners often have limited opportunity to interact with people from the target culture and develop their intercultural competence (IC) through those interactions both inside and outside of the classroom. To identify a new opportunity to engage Korean EFL learners in innovative ways to maximize target language interactions and develop their IC, this study adopts Facebook as a new computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool in a university classroom-based telecollaborative project between the U.S. and South Korea. The results revealed that Facebook offers Korean EFL learners an effective platform for intercultural interactions with people from the target culture, and Korean EFL learners demonstrate the abilities of the overall components of IC by showing many instances that fall well within Byram's (2000) assessment criteria, although some conflicting results exist. This study suggests that the adoption of Facebook is a new, innovative, and practical way to facilitate effective intercultural interactions as well as promote IC in the EFL classroom.","subject":"Social Networks, Technology Uses in Education, Intercultural Communication, Cultural Awareness, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Foreign Countries, College Students, Telecommunications, Intercultural Programs, Teaching Methods, Instructional Effectiveness, Participant Observation, Ethnography, Qualitative Research, Interviews, Content Analysis","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"South Korea, United States"},{"id":"EJ1075831","title":"The Intersection of Multimodality and Critical Perspective: Multimodality as Subversion","author":"Huang, Shin-ying","description":"This study explores the relevance of multimodality to critical media literacy. It is based on the understanding that communication is intrinsically multimodal and multimodal communication is inherently social and ideological. By analysing two English-language learners' multimodal ensembles, the study reports on how multimodality contributes to a critical perspective when engaging with media texts, and on the ways in which learners orchestrate multiple semiotic resources to demonstrate their analysis of the politics of representation and the resulting consequences. The findings reveal that, on the one hand, the students were able to identify the power relations between characters as well as how particular characters are marginalized in the media texts they viewed by paying attention to the multiple modes that make up the text's representation. On the other hand, the students were able to articulate the ideological subtexts they identified through the orchestration of various modes rather than relying on the linguistic mode, making their message as persuasive and effective as those in the media texts viewed.","subject":"Media Literacy, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Power Structure, Semiotics, Films, Teaching Methods, Racial Relations, Gender Differences, Interpersonal Relationship, College Students, Second Language Instruction, Critical Literacy, Foreign Countries, Qualitative Research, Focus Groups, Interviews","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1075815","title":"&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;: Multilingual Identity and Digital Translanguaging","author":"Schreiber, Brooke Ricker","description":"This paper presents a case study of the multilingual writing practices of a Serbian university student on Facebook, examining how he uses multiple varieties of English and Serbian images and video to shape his online identity and establish membership in local and global communities. Drawing on data from stimulated-recall interviews, online participant observation, and rhetorical analysis, this study shows how Aleksandar, a hip-hop artist, appropriates hip-hop codes and employs the &quot;gate-keeping&quot; function of posting links (Baek, Holton, Harp, &amp; Yaschur, 2011) by embedding links to music videos in his own highly personal code-mixed text in order to establish himself as a distinctly Serbian member of the global hip-hop community. The findings suggest that Aleksandar's language practices and attitudes might be better understood as translingual (Canagarajah, 2011), as the student integrates diverse linguistic and semiotic resources into a unified expression of identity, relying on the multimodal affordances of digital writing to accomplish his communicative goals. However, these sophisticated textual practices go undervalued in his EFL writing courses, where formal, monolingual, non-digital literacy remains primary (Saxena, 2011). These findings suggest a need to re-evaluate what it means to have a second language-mediated identity, and to expand the focus of EFL writing pedagogy.","subject":"Multilingualism, Code Switching (Language), Music, Language Usage, Language Attitudes, Video Technology, Case Studies, Participant Observation, Writing (Composition), Recall (Psychology), Semiotics, English (Second Language), Writing Instruction, Technological Literacy, Second Language Learning, Self Concept, Teaching Methods, Social Networks, Foreign Countries, Serbocroatian, College Students, Semi Structured Interviews, Qualitative Research","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Serbia"},{"id":"EJ1063777","title":"A Meta-Synthesis of Empirical Research on the Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) in SLA","author":"Lin, Huifen","description":"This meta-analysis reports the results of a systematic synthesis of primary studies on the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in second language acquisition (SLA) for the period 2000-2012.
