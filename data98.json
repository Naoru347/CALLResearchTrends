Increasingly more universities are offering individual courses and majors in the field of Data Science. This study evaluates data science education as a means to become proficient in scientific literacy. The results demonstrate how the educational goals of a Data Science course meet the scientific literacy criteria in regards to the process of science. Based on the commonality between data science and scientific literacy courses, the paper concludes that a data science course can be used as an alternative way for students in any major to gain scientific literacy skills.","subject":"Information Science, Higher Education, Scientific Literacy, Data Analysis, Data Collection, Science Process Skills, Scientific Methodology","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015}]
