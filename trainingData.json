It is thought that determining the meaning of mathematics in students' minds, the things that students associate mathematics with and the things that come to their minds when you say mathematics is vital. In this way, it is thought that it can be possible to take some precautions for enabling students to develop positive attitudes towards mathematics, making mathematics more popular among students and reducing mathematics anxiety. This study is particularly important in terms of taking the opinions of students who will be responsible for teaching mathematics and making students become more interested in mathematics so that they can take necessary precautions before they start teaching at schools. This study is a qualitative research and the data obtained through coding the answers provided by students from the Department of Teaching Primary School Mathematics. Two questions in the opinion form were divided into categories and themes were displayed in tables by given percentages and frequencies. In this sense, content analysis from qualitative data approaches and phenomenology from qualitative research designs were used. The study group consisted of 153 students (from freshman to senior) who are studying at Kafkas University, Faculty of Education, Department of Teaching Primary School Mathematics. It was concluded that students mentioned &quot;nature,&quot; &quot;life&quot;,&quot; &quot;oxygen,&quot; &quot;everything complicated&quot; and &quot;puzzle&quot; for &quot;mathematics,&quot; and they provided answers such as &quot;concepts related to mathematics,&quot; &quot;middle school mathematics teacher&quot; and &quot;everything&quot; for the question stated as &quot;What is the first thing that comes to your mind when we say mathematics?&quot;", "subject": "Student Attitudes, Mathematics Instruction, Departments, Mathematical Concepts, Positive Attitudes, Mathematics Anxiety, Qualitative Research, Content Analysis, Phenomenology, Figurative Language, Mathematics Teachers, Elementary School Mathematics, Foreign Countries, Preservice Teachers, Elementary School Teachers", "source": "Educational Research and Reviews", "publicationdateyear": 2018, "identifiersgeo": "Turkey"}, {"title": "Negative Feedback on Task Repetition: ESL vs. EFL Child Settings", "author": "Azkarai, Agurtzane, Oliver, Rhonda", "description": "Research on task repetition in second language (L2) learning has shown the benefits of this practice for subsequent L2 learning.

Meanwhile, the two researchers have chosen the State University of Malang in Indonesia as a case study because it is one of the renowned universities in Indonesia and as it takes much interest in Arabic Language Education. Therefore, both researchers evaluated the Arabic Language Instructional Materials adopted in the State University of Malang, Indonesia under the light of Communication Approach in the Arabic Teaching Language where they distributed questionnaires to the teachers of the university concerned in order to get facts on the content about the Arabic Language Instructional Materials therein, then they analyzed them through quantitative and evaluative methods for the purpose of achieving the rightly desired outcome. The Communication Approach in the teaching Arabic for Non-Native Speakers observes that Arabic language is a communication means, and it is necessary that its teaching be made for this purpose. Therefore, the existence of the suitable Instructional Materials which can empower students on the communication skills in Arabic language is a very important issue in the teaching of Arabic language under the light of this approach. Thus, this research paper is a quantitative evaluative work as it exploits quantitative method to identify some facts about the proper instructional materials for Arabic Language Teaching at the State University of Malang in Indonesia from a widest and comprehensive perspective (Obserne, 1977). As for the evaluative method, it has been adopted for the purpose of rendering an accurate objective ruling, on some approaches, processes and products. Consequently, the areas of strengths and weakness are identifiable to facilitate the adoption of suitable resolutions that can rectify the detected points of weakness and failure (Yusuf, 1962). The research has consequently arrived at an outcome that the positive sides of the instructional materials for the Arabic Language teaching in the State University of Malang in Indonesia are visibly apparent as it is grossly equipped with various (audio-visual) teaching aids. Likewise, the majority of the teachers are highly interested in using them during the teaching process, because of its perfection, development and enhanced effectiveness, in addition to the availability of a number of teachers who are well-versed in using them. In regard to the negative sides, it is obviously seen in the manner of oversight of small number of them while using the materials during Arabic Language Teaching. This negative side should be improved in order to acquaint all the teachers of that university with the application of various teaching aids in the teaching procedures, in addition to a big number among them who are not well-versed in using them to some extent. That is a weak side of it which should be improved so as to achieve perfection in Arabic Language teaching at that university in a better way.

A methodological approach combining a meta-analysis of quantitative data with qualitative ones was adopted in order to present the broadest picture of the current research on educational use of games. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis of 180 effect size comparisons out of 154 empirical studies on the effect of both digital and non-digital games on academic achievement conducted during the period from 2004 to 2019 in order to determine the overall effect size of using games for teaching various subjects. The overall sample size of the studies included a total number of 12800 participants. Some moderator analyses were also carried out to determine the exact efficiency of educational games in terms of student levels, durations of implementation of game activities, school subjects in which games were used, class sizes, kinds of games and achievement tests used. The findings suggest that educational games have a positive effect on academic achievement and this effect is at a medium level (g = 0.695).

A key strategy for building CS teaching capacity has been preparing teachers of other subjects (e.g., math, technology applications, business) to teach introductory CS through short-term professional development (PD) workshops, online training modules, micro-credentials, and teacher meetups or conferences (Christensen Institute, 2019). As various new CS curricula and activities using different computational representations or programming environments are rolled out each year, it can be difficult for teachers to make sense of how they map to CS standards or fit with existing activities. To benefit a wide range of teachers using a variety of CS curricula across different programming languages, CS teacher PD needs to focus on CS standards and CS content and pedagogical knowledge rather than merely the details of a particular curriculum. This white paper details the elements of effective CS education, known teacher challenges in CS education, and the current state of CS teacher PD. It also describes an approach to address some of these teacher challenges and help teachers understand CS standards and develop their CS formative assessment skills.

These are defined in SDT as nutrients essential for integration, growth, healthy development and well-being (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). SDT posits that social learning contexts in which learners' basic psychological needs are supported facilitate and sustain autonomous functioning, more effective learning and performance, strengthen adaptability, promote awareness, and foster greater wellness (Reeve, 2016; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017; Vansteenkiste et al., 2019). While a growing body of research provides insight into ways advising promotes and is supportive of autonomous language learning and transformation (Kato &amp; Mynard, 2016; Mynard, forthcoming), more specific studies are believed to be needed to develop a deeper understanding of the potential of its supportive role in this area. To address this gap, this study investigates how learners' perceptions of their experiences in advising can be understood from an SDT perspective. Findings from a qualitative analysis of a self-reporting questionnaire suggests that participation in advising has potential to provide support for the satisfaction of language learners' basic psychological needs.

This qualitative, interpretive case study draws upon CRP and sociocultural frameworks to specifically investigate the visual, media, and technological literacy (multimodal) practices in a community college developmental English class for multilingual students. When visual, media, and technological literacy practices are purposefully included in a CRP framework and curriculum, it helps to reposition both teachers' and students' conceptual understanding of language acquisition. Two important aims of this study are to fill an existing gap of literature around the CRP theoretical framework and strengthen it with the specific inclusion of college-level, multilingual student's use of visual and technological literacy practices for the acquisition of English literacy. This in turn helps to legitimize the inclusion of visual and technological literacies into curriculums designed especially for multilingual students which are also adaptable for any class. In this study, my classroom serves as the primary unit of analysis (Merriam, 2009). I present the multimodal practices of four student participants as &quot;cases&quot; or portraits to illustrate the study's findings. I am interpreting/defining the multimodal productions my students create as their observable literacy events (Barton &amp; Hamilton, 2000; Heath, 1992) and their literacy practice is the ongoing act of creating and engaging with visual, media, and other related technological literacy practices. The act of students creating multimodal productions, &quot;visual interpretation,&quot; is the specific visual literacy practice this study investigates triangulated with students' interactions on a group Facebook page and digital story compositions. Using a reflexive model (Luttrell, 2010b) of research and additional grounded theory methods (Charmaz, 2008, 2010; Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008) to analyze data, findings for this study reveal that a curriculum utilizing multimodal literacy practices promote Ladson-Billings' (1992, 2006) three tenets of CRP: academic excellence, cultural competence, and sociopolitical consciousness in the following ways: First, the curriculum acknowledges students' multiple literacies and cultural backgrounds. Second, the curriculum enables students to become personally invested and more engaged in their academic participation, productions and achievement. Third, the curriculum raises students' competencies in reading/writing comprehension, deconstruction, and production of subsequent multimodal texts as it privileges students' own literacy practices. Therefore, visual literacy practices should be a mechanism for achieving and representing these tenets of a Culturally Relevant Pedagogy inside college classrooms with curriculums designed for multilingual students.

Bilingual education in various settings produces a wide variety of outcomes in terms of language proficiency, cultural awareness, and scholastic achievement. The purpose of the present study was to examine teacher agency in changing the language model of the preschool that aimed at enhancing willingness to use L2 (Arabic) among the Hebrew-speaking 4-6-year-old children. Two research questions guided this study: 1) How did teachers implement their agency in the process of language model modification; and 2) Is there a correspondence between teachers' perception of their role in the process and the observed language practices in the preschool? To answer these questions, we used multiple sources of qualitative data, such as observations and interviews. The findings indicate that teachers saw themselves as agents of linguistic change and were adamant about providing the class with maximum exposure to Arabic during the designated period of the project. Secondly, teachers made use of several strategies aimed at enhancing Arabic L2 output amongst Hebrew-speaking children who were previously reluctant to use the language. Finally, there is a clear correspondence between teachers' and researchers' perception of the former's agency in the modification of the language model.

We surveyed 330 school professionals to examine their perceptions about four mirrored behaviors displayed by ELs during instruction, as indicators of either a second-language difficulty or a learning disability. Only 31% of the respondents correctly indicated that none of the behaviors can distinguish these two possibilities. The probability of correct assessment was positively associated with the level of English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) training for those with less than 15 years of teaching experience and negatively associated for those with more than 20 years of experience.

Correct assessment was not generally associated with the level of SPED training.

However, they do not teach them systematically or consistently. Indeed, lack of targeted teacher training, time constraints, and disregard of metacognitive instruction are likely to be obstacles to the efficient implementation of reading strategy-instruction. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown up several psychological and cognitive learners' difficulties, including decreased motivation and lack of cognitive focus, making the teaching process more challenging.

In order for students to engage authentically and fully in the science learning that will take place in their classrooms, it is important that they develop their abilities to use science academic language (National Research Council, 2012). For this to occur, teachers must provide support to their students in developing the science academic language they will encounter in their classrooms. Unfortunately, this type of support remains a challenge for many teachers (Baecher, Farnsworth, &amp; Ediger, 2014; Bigelow, 2010; Fisher &amp; Frey, 2010) and teachers must receive professional development that supports their abilities to provide instruction that supports and scaffolds students' science academic language use and development. This study investigates an elementary science teacher's engagement in an instructional coaching partnership to explore how that teacher planned and implemented scaffolds for science academic language. Using a theoretical framework that combines the literature on scaffolding (Bunch, Walqui, &amp; Kibler, 2015; Gibbons, 2015; Sharpe, 2001/2006) and instructional coaching (Knight, 2007/2009), this study sought to understand how an elementary science teacher plans and implements scaffolds for science academic language, and the resources that assisted the teacher in planning those scaffolds. The overarching goal of this work is to understand how elementary science teachers can scaffold language in their classroom, and how they can be supported in that work. Using a classroom teaching experiment methodology (Cobb, 2000) and constructivist grounded theory methods (Charmaz, 2014) for analysis, this study examined coaching conversations and classroom instruction to identify and understand what scaffolds are planned and implemented, and how that planning and implementation occurred through an instructional coaching partnership. Findings from this study showed the elementary science teacher planned and implemented a number of scaffolds for science academic language, focusing primarily on the use of sentence starters as a scaffolding strategy. The findings also indicated that the instructional coaching partnership played a vital role as the main resource that assisted the planning of scaffolds. These findings provide insights into the types of scaffolds that elementary science teachers can implement to scaffold science academic language, and the role that instructional coaching can play in supporting teachers as they work to provide instruction that scaffolds their students' language use and development.

In addition, this study aims to explore primary considerations come into play in TFA teachers' teacher identity development as novice teachers of ELLs. The theoretical lenses guiding this study are Wenger's Community of Practice perspective and Positioning theory (Davies &amp; Harre, 1990). A multiple-case design is employed to examine TFA teachers' teacher identity in relation to ELLs. Data collection took place approximately six months and included individual interviews, focus group discussion, artifacts, field observations and researcher's journal. Findings indicated that the TESL course provided context for developing new understandings for the TFA teachers and contributed to their teacher identity through improving their knowledge of the education of ELLs. The TESL course also led to some positive changes in the TFA teachers' beliefs about the teaching of ELLs and enabled them to develop new understandings about working with ELLs as content-area teachers. However, the TESL course did not influence all five TFA teachers' positional identities as teachers of ELLs. The TFA teachers, except one, did not take on a linguistically responsive teacher perspective and charged bilingual or ESL teachers with the responsibility of educating ELLs. This study also found that the following five primary considerations influenced the trajectory of the five TFA teachers' professional development as novice teachers of ELLs: (a) decision to become a teacher, (b) school culture, (c) level of content area knowledge, (d) positionings in relation to ELLs, and (e) sources of support. These considerations facilitated or hindered the TFA teachers' teacher identity development process as novice teachers in the teaching community and played a role in their growth as teachers of ELLs. This study contributes to the literature by examining TFA teachers' teacher identity development in relation to ELLs and identifying primary considerations that influenced TFA teachers' teacher identities as novice teachers of ELLs. The findings of this study have implications for the TFA organization and teacher preparation courses on ELL instruction.

Instead, they must acquire both vocabulary and grammar incrementally, by generalizing across multiple situations that eventually enable links between words in utterances and referents in the environment to be established. However, this raises a problem of how vocabulary can be acquired without first knowing the role of the word within the syntax of a sentence. It also raises practical issues about the extent to which different instructional conditions -- about grammar in advance of learning or feedback about correct decisions during learning -- might influence second language acquisition of implicitly experienced information about the language. In an artificial language learning study, we studied participants learning language from inductive exposure, but under different instructional conditions. Language learners were exposed to complex utterances and complex scenes and had to determine the meaning and the grammar of the language from these co-occurrences with environmental scenes. We found that learning was boosted by explicit feedback, but not by explicit instruction about the grammar of the language, compared to an implicit learning condition. However, the effect of feedback was not general across all aspects of the language. Feedback improved vocabulary, but did not affect syntax learning. We further investigated the local, contextual effects on learning, and found that previous knowledge of vocabulary within an utterance improved learning but that this was driven only by certain grammatical categories in the language.

Yet, this criticism still remains at the hypothetical level in most of the literature. This paper aims to advance the theory by addressing this criticism on an empirical basis. The research highlights a language teaching reform context where the traditional and liberal pedagogies co-existed in a Chinese university department. Based on a narrative inquiry of an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher's (Feng) experience during the reform, this paper reports four stories distilled from multiple &quot;restorying cycles&quot; and knit together as a coherent narrative of Feng's learning trajectory. The first story narrates how Feng was persuaded to join the department and lead the liberal pedagogical reform. The second story illustrates Feng's loss of identity when she was confronted with the challenges of competing pedagogies and the conflicting identities of a liberal and a traditional practitioner. The third story recounts her identity crisis when she tried to put into practice liberal assumptions in parenting her daughter. The last story relates the critical incident that led to Feng's self-exclusion from the community. The research findings indicate that teachers need to shift their identities to adapt to the new work order in the workplace. This process is intertwined with a two-way trajectory of learning, which can be shaped and reshaped by various power relationships in the community. The research findings have brought important messages for administrators and teachers alike to deal with the new challenges in the workplace.

The Open Resources for English Language Teaching (ORELT) is one such educational innovation. This paper reports the findings of a baseline survey conducted in Kenya with a view to finding out the views and perceptions of Kenyan Junior Secondary School Teachers with regard to the adoption of open resources for the teaching of English language in Kenyan secondary schools. Sixty (60) JSS teachers of English from rural and urban schools and of mixed gender were invited for a four day ORELT in-service induction workshop at the Kenyatta University Conference Centre. The teachers were then given ORELT materials in the form of CDs and textbooks for use in teaching English in their schools. They were also registered on the online ORELT platform and each given log in credentials to enable them freely to access the materials and freely interact with fellow teachers throughout the Commonwealth. The study reports that whereas teachers are ready to embrace the use of open resources, they have varying perceptions on the suitability and potential efficacy of open resources in Kenyan classrooms.

DA is distinguished by its insistence that an individual's independent performance of assessment tasks reveals only part of his/her abilities, namely those that have completed their development at the time of the assessment; insights into abilities that have begun to emerge but have not yet fully developed can be determined according to an individual's responsiveness to particular kinds of support, referred to as mediation (e.g., reminders, leading questions, hints, provision of a model, feedback), offered during the assessment as difficulties arise (Haywood &amp; Lidz, 2006). In this respect, DA differs from more conventional distinctions in assessment, such as that between assessments concerned with the results of previous learning ('summative assessment') and those intended to provide information relevant to subsequent instruction ('formative assessment'). Instead, the embedding of an interactive, instructional element within the assessment procedure allows for the possibility of expanding the evidential basis upon which summative interpretations of learner abilities are made; that is, the results encompass previous learning that has resulted in both complete and partial understanding of relevant concepts. At the same time, DA serves a formative function in so far as interaction allows insights into the underlying sources of learner difficulties and the kind of support to which they are most responsive (Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 2002).", "subject": "Alternative Assessment, Second Language Learning, Student Evaluation, Performance Based Assessment, Summative Evaluation, Formative Evaluation, Learning Problems", "source": "Language Teaching", "publicationdateyear": 2021, "identifiersgeo": null}, {"title": "Interculturality in Online Learning: Instructor and Student Accommodations", "author": "Sadykova, Gulnara, Meskill, Carla", "description": "As more distance education courses broaden their reach across borders, the chances of online classes being multicultural are high.

Mind, body, and world are thus functionally integrated from a sociocognitive perspective instead of radically separated. Learning plays a major part in this scenario: If environments are ever-changing, then adaptation to them is continuous. Learning is part of our natural ability to so adapt, while retaining traces of that adaptation in the integrated mind-body-world system. Viewed in this way, SLA is adaptation to/engagement with L2 environments. &quot;Interaction&quot; also plays a central role in sociocognitive SLA: We learn L2s through interacting with/in L2 environments. Founded on innate, universal skills which evolutionarily &quot;preceded&quot; language and make it possible, interaction supports SLA at every turn.

Results indicated that ELLs in dual language two-way, one-way, and transitional late exit, in first through third grade, experience higher literacy levels of achievement than ELLs in transitional early exit bilingual programs. Information from the current study provides valuable guidance to local school districts when selecting from the various program models to meet the needs of English Language Learners.

Arts integration can provide motivation and a new pathway to learning. This unit focused on inquiry into the natural history of artifacts and rocks recovered from the exposed subsoil of an area near Cedar Falls, Iowa that had been bulldozed as part of subdivision development. The described unit involved preservice teachers in exploration of all subject areas (language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies) with arts-integrated projects (agate watercolor painting, stone tool graphing, acrylic polymer clay agate keyring making, and stone tool drawings). The content area activities for social studies included identification and lifestyle interpretation of stone tools found intermixed with rocks and sand in the subsoil of the site. Science content activities included identification of rocks (igneous and metamorphic rocks; quartz nodules, geodes, and agates; and iron ore specimens) from the site along with interpretation of basalt cobbles that had been ground flat as glacially transported, and interpretation of maps and diagrams of glaciation, iron ore deposits, and agate deposits. Language arts activities involved word study through morpheme analysis of words such as &quot;anthropology&quot; and &quot;artifact&quot; along with matching a set of descriptive adjectives to objects related to agates. Mathematics content activities focused on graphing. Preservice teachers were highly engaged in the activities, remarking that they learned new content and pedagogy. Some expressed lack of confidence regarding artistic ability because of little experience and the desire to complete everything in the correct manner. At the end of the lessons, preservice teachers expressed that teaching the content through themes allowed for a great number of connections between subject areas, increased real-life connections, and deeper understandings of the topics.", "subject": "Preservice Teachers, Middle School Teachers, Interdisciplinary Approach, Preservice Teacher Education, History Instruction, Art Activities, Language Arts, Mathematics Instruction, Science Instruction, Social Studies, Learning Activities, Observation", "source": "Journal of STEM Arts, Crafts, and Constructions", "publicationdateyear": 2017, "identifiersgeo": "Iowa"}, {"title": "Hopefulness for Teachers of ELLs in the Era of NCLB", "author": "Colombo, Michaela, McMakin, Deborah, Jacobs, Cynthia, Shestok, Carol", "description": "In this article the authors explore the role of critical hope as an essential quality in teachers' preparation to teach English Language Learners (ELLs) in the era of No Child Left Behind.

However, most previous studies have been restricted to laboratory settings rather than the classroom environment. The present study, therefore, was designed to fill this knowledge gap by analysing the effectiveness of audio-visual aids, particularly articulatory gestures, in teaching L2 speech sounds in actual classrooms. The participants were students from two classes of non-English majors who had severe difficulties with the differentiation of /[theta]/--/s/ and /[voiced dental fricative]/--/z/. 'Read-aloud' tasks were employed for pronunciation tests. The baseline data of the students' pronunciation of the two contrasts was collected with a pre-test, and the intuitive--imitative approach was adopted for teaching. Specifically, the students were exposed to seven audio- or audio-visually recorded poems (one poem per week over the course of seven weeks) containing the target contrasts. The students in Class 1 were taught with the audio-recordings without images of the speaker's face being displayed; in contrast, students in Class 2 were taught using audio-visual recordings, which allowed them to observe the speakers' articulatory gestures of /[theta]/--/s/ and /[voiced dental fricative]/--/z/. To detect the teaching effect, a post-test was carried out after the teaching programme was completed. A delayed post-test was conducted one month after the post-test. Comparisons with the respective pre-test results indicated that students in Class 2 had a significant improvement in the pronunciation of the target contrasts in the post-test, whereas those in Class 1 did not. In the delayed post-test, neither class showed any significant difference in the pronunciation performance in comparison with the post-test. The findings, therefore, confirmed the effectiveness of exposure to audio-visual aids in teaching L2 pronunciation.", "subject": "Articulation (Speech), Nonverbal Communication, Pronunciation, Language Tests, Teaching Methods, Poetry, Second Language Learning, Audiovisual Aids, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Speech Communication, Nonmajors, Undergraduate Students, Pretests Posttests, Pronunciation Instruction, Instructional Materials, Foreign Countries", "source": "Language Teaching Research", "publicationdateyear": 2019, "identifiersgeo": "China"}, {"title": "Reader's Theater: An Alternative Tool to Develop Reading Fluency among Thai EFL Learners", "author": "Lekwilai, Panya", "description": "Fluency in reading is critical for becoming a successful reader and strongly correlates with reading comprehension.

Drawing upon a new theoretical frame for primary languages, Critical Cosmopolitanism (Delanty, 2006; Beck and Sznaider, 2006) and The Grammar of Culture (Holliday, 2018), we argue that the grand narrative of a target language inhabited by a target culture is outdated and approaches to cultural learning in primary schools could lead the way. There is substantial evidence that most learners find language lessons fun, particularly activities such as songs, stories and intercultural events (Driscoll et al., 2004, 2014; Cable et al. 2010). The discourse on conditions for inclusive practice is less commonplace and little is known about FL learning in areas of high deprivation (Nikolov &amp; Mihaljevic Djigunovic, 2011). Teachers and headteachers in this study were committed to cultural learning and staff adopted creative approaches to teaching. The findings, however, also indicate that traditional notions of a mono or homogenised national culture with associated stereotypes linger in teachers' framing of FL.
