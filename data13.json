Unstructured data in Social media can provide useful insights into social phenomena and citizen opinions, both of which are critical to government policy and businesses decisions. Teachers of business intelligence and analytics commonly use quantitative data from sales, marketing, finance and manufacturing to demonstrate various analytics concepts in a business context. However, researchers have seldom used social media data to analyze social behavior and communication. In this study we aim to demonstrate an assessment structure for teaching social media analytics concepts with the goal of analyzing and interpreting social media content. We base this assessment on forum postings regarding two recent events: the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The aim of the assessment is to discover social insights. We base the assessment structure on Cooper's Analytics Framework to cover such concepts as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), data visualization, sentiments and opinions analysis, the Nearest Neighbor K-NN classification algorithm, and Information Diffusion theory. We review how the students performed on the assignment that used this assessment, and we make recommendations for future studies.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Social Media, Data Analysis, Natural Disasters, Visualization, Word Frequency, Content Analysis, Opinions, Information Theory, Social Behavior, Undergraduate Students, Educational Benefits, Business, Intelligence, Web Sites, Discourse Analysis, Altruism, Emotional Response, Computer Mediated Communication, Affective Behavior, Classification, Information Dissemination, Scores","source":"Journal of Information Systems Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Japan, New Zealand"},{"id":"EJ1137358","title":"Assessing Cyberbullying in Higher Education","author":"Kamali, Ali","description":"This project aims to expose information educators to various aspects of cyberbullying for the purpose of policy development in an environment of higher education. The preponderance of nation-wide research on cyberbullying is concentrated on adolescents; such efforts in college campuses are limited to individual endeavors. Cyberbullying research on college campuses lacks a unified definition of the concept. Although the states mandated most school districts to develop and enact some sort of policy, the law is silent on the college level cyberbullying. According to the literature, &quot;cyberbullying&quot; is reserved for adolescents; however, &quot;cyber-harassment&quot; or &quot;cyberstalking&quot; are related to adults. While cyberbullying shares with conventional bullying intimidation, aggression, and harm, it is unique because (1) the encounter is not face-to-face; (2) the perpetrator can employ varied means (e.g., cellphones, texts, blogs, Internet, social media, etc.); and (3) the act can be undisclosed. The data was collected from a random sample of 511 students (out of a student population of approximately 6,000) in a Midwestern town by employing self-administered questionnaire. It was found that engagement with different social network groups and online communications with those with questionable identity are good predictor of increased vulnerability to the risks of being victimized. The data suggests being victimized leads to victimization. Although males differ from females in terms of the type and the extent of cyberbullying, no significant difference was found among the categories of student status or their class ranks.","subject":"Higher Education, College Students, Bullying, Computer Mediated Communication, Adolescents, Social Media, Telecommunications, Questionnaires, Predictor Variables, Victims, At Risk Persons, Gender Differences, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis, Student Characteristics","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1084413","title":"Building Innovative Online Korean and Japanese Courses: A Pilot on Technology-Enhanced Curriculum Development","author":"Sato, Eriko, Sohn, Heejeong, Chen, Julian ChengChiang, Adebowale, Kayode C.

In the initial phase, we conducted a survey of students' experiences with and perceptions about blended\/online Asian language learning. We found a general lack of familiarity with, and moderate resistance toward, online language learning modes. With learner attitudes in mind, we developed online modules for beginning Korean and Japanese courses. In this article, we report the survey results and the process of developing these innovative blended and online modalities of content delivery, focusing on the strengths of the modules and the unforeseen development challenges. The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-\/copresence are explored. We suggest that transforming conventional East Asian language courses into blended\/online modes is not only feasible but also beneficial for foreign language teaching and learning.","subject":"Online Courses, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Korean, Japanese, Blended Learning, Student Attitudes, Pilot Projects, Program Descriptions, Student Surveys, Teaching Methods, Instructional Innovation, Familiarity, Distance Education, Curriculum Design, Action Research, Comparative Analysis, Interactive Video, Educational Technology, Standards, Computer Mediated Communication, Cultural Awareness, Program Effectiveness, Factor Analysis","source":"Journal of Educational Technology Systems","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"New York"},{"id":"EJ1137392","title":"Steganography and Cryptography Inspired Enhancement of Introductory Programming Courses","author":"Kortsarts, Yana, Kempner, Yulia","description":"Steganography is the art and science of concealing communication. The goal of steganography is to hide the very existence of information exchange by embedding messages into unsuspicious digital media covers. Cryptography, or secret writing, is the study of the methods of encryption, decryption and their use in communications protocols. Steganography manipulates data to ensure the security of information, but the concept of steganography differs from cryptography. Cryptography obscures the meaning of a message, but it does not conceal the fact that there &quot;is&quot; a message. The goal of cryptography is to make data unreadable by a third party, whereas the goal of steganography is to hide the data from a third party. We present a way to integrate steganography and cryptology examples into introductory programming courses. This enrichment promotes active involvement in the course and provides opportunity to engage students in experimental problem solving and collaborative learning to enhance critical thinking.","subject":"Introductory Courses, Programming, Computer Science Education, Technology, Learner Engagement, Problem Solving, Cooperative Learning, Critical Thinking, College Freshmen, Enrichment, Computer Security","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1077606","title":"Examining the Effect of External Factors and Context-Dependent Beliefs of Teachers in the Use of ICT in Teaching: Using an Elaborated Theory of Planned Behavior","author":"Salleh, Sallimah, Laxman, Kumar","description":"Research into teachers' attitudes, beliefs, competence, and inhibitions in relation to their use of technology may provide answers to a series of questions from administrators that relate to teachers' classroom implementation of Information and Communication Technology.

These projects have the potential to deepen students' understanding of course topics by allowing them to put concepts into practice and watch the results develop. However, experiential learning projects require significant guidance, communication between students and faculty, and direction. Coupled with the communication intricacies of an online learning environment, experiential learning projects become a little more difficult to manage. In this article, the authors examine some of the best practices for teaching online courses as they relate to experiential learning projects, the value of experiential learning projects and then apply a project management approach to addressing the challenges of assigning experiential learning projects in online courses looking at two courses taught at the authors' institution.

The business marketing function has become so technologically driven it is sometimes hard to tell where the boundaries between the Marketing and Information Systems disciplines lie. The new world of digital marketing has changed how both marketing and technology professionals approach their jobs. Digital has created new roles, and much of what we knew and taught in higher education is no longer viable. New hybrid education programs are required to equip the new generation of workers with the skills they need to be successful. While marketing and information systems and technology education programs will undoubtedly continue to exist as separate entities, there are opportunities for cross pollination between the two disciplines. Just as corporate enterprises will need to embrace this new way of doing business if they are to be successful, so too will academic enterprises need to incorporate new methods and new ideas into their offerings if they are to remain competitive with their peer institutions. This paper explores the concept of how this new digital world has transformed the marketing function, the impact it has on the consumerization of information technology, and how higher education will have to respond. Digital has arrived, and it is here to stay.","subject":"Marketing, Information Systems, Interdisciplinary Approach, Information Technology, Social Media, Influence of Technology, Higher Education, Business Administration Education, Computer Science Education, Communication (Thought Transfer), Access to Information, Handheld Devices, Data","source":"Information Systems Education Journal","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1077665","title":"Berlin Kompass: Multimodal Gameful Empowerment for Foreign Language Learning","author":"Kallioniemi, Pekka, Posti, Laura-Pihkala, Hakulinen, Jaakko, Turunen, Markku, Keskinen, Tuuli, Raisamo, Roope","description":"This article presents an innovative, gameful, multimodal, and authentic learning environment for training of oral communication in a foreign language--a virtual adventure called Berlin Kompass.

Understanding an image requires less work and fewer skills than reading a text. This paper aims to highlight how messages are perceived and received within the educational activities, through the two types of communication, iconic and logical-linguistic. The instrument used in conducting the research was represented by a questionnaire consisting from objective and subjective items, applied to students from high schools in Oradea. Besides these questionnaires, a key role in the study was played by the knowledge gained while observing lessons held by students of the University of Oradea within their teaching placement, as well as while supervising teachers from secondary educational institutions in the process of obtaining teacher certification level 1. The obtained results prove that the majority of investigated students prefer the combination of two types of communication in teaching.","subject":"High School Students, Learning Modalities, Visual Learning, Questionnaires, Intermode Differences, Interpersonal Communication, Learning Activities, Teaching Methods, Preferences, Cognitive Style, Educational Practices, Foreign Countries","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Romania"},{"id":"EJ1121021","title":"Credibility and Accountability in Academic Discourse: Increasing the Awareness of Ghanaian Graduate Students","author":"Adika, Gordon S.

The attacks and intimidation attempts have introduced the term of &quot;mobbing&quot; which is defined as regular and continuous psychological violence faced by people always trying to produce and win from those who they work with. The term of &quot;mobbing&quot; has recently become a popular academic issue which has been sophisticatedly handled in relevant literature. Mobbing is defined as the act of continuous and systematic intimidation purposefully performed by either some employees or employers on some employees through emotional violence. As mobbing is considered to be significant for both corporate and employee, the starting point of this study was to investigate how mobbing acts are reflected on newspapers as they are mass communication means. One of the most important means of media is print media. Print media is the first means of media when mentioned about media. Newspapers are means through which people are always kept up to date about the latest news in civilized societies. With this regard, the most basic purpose of this study is to investigate the news about the mobbing events experienced in higher education system under the light of national policy documents and reports. The study was carried out based on a qualitative approach. The news released in print media was chosen purposefully as print media means report news in a detailed way, have an evidential value and can be read again on demand. The research group in this study consists of the mobbing news released on Hurriyet, Sabah and Zaman which are newspapers published in Turkey between the years of 2009-2013. These newspapers were purposefully chosen based on criterion sampling method. The most basic understanding underlying this sampling method is to study on all cases which meet the standards set prior to the start of the study. The newspapers mentioned above were chosen considering that they are published nationally, reference newspapers and belong to different publication groups. The data used in this study was taken from the archive of the three newspapers. When the archives of the newspapers was scanned, the word &quot;mobbing&quot; was taken as key word for the search. In qualitative researches, newspapers are considered to be public archive and used as reference documents. The data obtained was grouped depending on the newspapers which it was taken from, on the year of publication, on where they took place, on the gender of the victims and on who the sufferers are.","subject":"Foreign Countries, Bullying, Newspapers, Higher Education, Qualitative Research, News Reporting, Violence","source":"Practice and Theory in Systems of Education","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"}]
