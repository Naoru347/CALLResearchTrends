[{"id":"EJ1047675","title":"Developing a Corpus-Based Paraphrase Tool to Improve EFL Learners' Writing Skills","author":"Chen, M.-H., Huang, S.-T., Chang, J. S., Liou, H.-C.","description":"Paraphrasing, or restating information using different words, is critical to successful writing. However, EFL learners have difficulty in making paraphrases to meet their writing demands, and there has been little research on developing automatic reference tools to assist these learners' paraphrasing skills for better writing quality. In this study, we developed PREFER, an online corpus-based paraphrasing assistance system. Allowing multi-word input and returning promptly with a list of paraphrases in English and Chinese, along with usage patterns and example sentences, &quot;PREFER&quot; provides substantial support for EFL learners to vary their expressions during writing. An assessment study of the effectiveness of &quot;PREFER&quot; was conducted with 55 Chinese-speaking EFL college freshmen in an Asian country. The results indicated that &quot;PREFER&quot; offered the most benefits to students' writing performance (with an after-use improvement of 38.2%), compared with an online dictionary and an online thesaurus (-31.6% and -6.2%, respectively). Further investigation revealed that the less proficient, more motivated, and more conservative students showed more significant progress in the paraphrasing task with the help of &quot;PREFER.&quot; In the meantime, nearly 90% of the students expressed satisfaction with the paraphrases generated by &quot;PREFER,&quot; and its functions, and another 75% of them acknowledged that &quot;PREFER&quot; benefits their writing task.","subject":"English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Computational Linguistics, Dictionaries, Internet, Writing (Composition), Language Usage, Chinese, Writing Improvement, Asians, College Freshmen, Student Attitudes, Writing Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Scoring Rubrics, Writing Evaluation, Pretests Posttests, Foreign Countries","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Asia"},{"id":"EJ1063481","title":"Dictionaries vs Concordancers: Actual Practice of the Two Different Tools in EFL Writing","author":"Lai, Shu-Li, Chen, Hao-Jan Howard","description":"A number of studies have suggested the possible benefits of using concordancers in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing. To date, however, there is still limited understanding of how EFL writers may make use of such tools along with dictionaries when engaging in a writing task. To better understand the question, this study investigated a class of non-English-major college students (N = 14) over a semester. Four online corpus tools, including monolingual and bilingual concordancers and collocation retrieval systems, were provided, along with two online dictionaries. After two tool-training sessions, students performed three timed-writing tasks online during three consecutive months and received individual stimulus recall interviews after each writing task. The recall interviews served as the main source of data; other data included the video clips of the writing process, student writing samples, and the researchers' notes. The result showed that students used corpus tools and the bilingual dictionary for different purposes. They tended to use a bilingual dictionary when information on word form and word meaning was needed. When searching for information related to word usage, collocation information, and grammar patterns, they chose corpus tools more often than a bilingual dictionary. However, they also turned to corpus tools for meaning and form when the bilingual dictionary failed to provide clear word meanings, when they needed to search for word strings, and when they needed to just confirm an intuition regarding either word form or word meaning. This study provides empirical data that help to better understand how corpus tools contribute to EFL writing.","subject":"Dictionaries, Indexes, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Computational Linguistics, Nonmajors, Writing (Composition), Phrase Structure, Recall (Psychology), Bilingualism, Monolingualism, Video Technology, Grammar, Definitions, Intuition, Writing Processes, College Students, Writing Instruction, Teaching Methods, Qualitative Research, Statistical Analysis, Semi Structured Interviews, Observation, Foreign Countries, Questionnaires","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"}]
