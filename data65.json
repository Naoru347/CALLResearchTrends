[{"id":"EJ1176699","title":"Input and Output Grammar Instruction in Tutorial CALL with a Complex Grammatical Structure","author":"Collentine, Joseph, Collentine, Karina","description":"Conceptual replication within a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) environment provides an understanding of the generalizability of second language acquisition (SLA) research (Porte, 2013; Smith &amp; Schulze, 2013). The present study replicates Collentine (1998a), a classroom-based experiment framed within a larger discussion on the relative benefits of input- and output-based instruction. Collentine (1998a) compared the benefits of Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 2004) and output-based instruction, both of which elevated the Spanish subjunctive's communicative value. The results showed that input- or output-oriented instruction informed by how learners process grammatical information can affect the acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena. This conceptual replication not only seeks to corroborate the original study's findings in a new learning context. It also tests the finding's generalizability to a tutorial CALL environment built on 3D simulations and emerging web-app technologies. The participants were foreign-language learners of Spanish in a classroom-based curriculum (N = 50). The results indicate that, in the classroom and in a CALL environment, both input- and output-oriented approaches can promote the acquisition of a complex grammatical structure if practice is meaningful (informed by psycholinguistic processing principles) and deliberate, and if feedback is provided.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Educational Technology, Grammar, Teaching Methods, Program Effectiveness, Spanish, Second Language Instruction, Computer Simulation, Feedback (Response), Statistical Analysis, Morphology (Languages), Language Proficiency, Cultural Awareness, Interdisciplinary Approach, Sentences, Verbs, Syntax, Regression (Statistics), Pretests Posttests","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015},{"id":"EJ1143785","title":"Conversation Analysis in Computer-Assisted Language Learning","author":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Lloret, Marta","description":"The use of Conversation Analysis (CA) in the study of technology-mediated interactions is a recent methodological addition to qualitative research in the field of Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL). The expansion of CA in Second Language Acquisition research, coupled with the need for qualitative techniques to explore how people interact in technology-mediated environments, has stimulated a small but growing body of research. This article reviews CALL research that employed a CA approach to the collection, microanalysis, and understanding of the data in a variety of technology-mediated fields (text, audio and video SCMC, email, forums and bulletin boards, social networks, and games), with participants from different contexts and languages, interacting in an L2 either among themselves or with native\/more expert speakers of the language. Most research up to now has been descriptive in nature, illustrating the sequential organization of interaction, interactional and linguistic resources employed by the participants, and affordances and challenges of the media to promote language learning. In addition, a few studies have directly explored &quot;learning&quot; through the microanalysis of longitudinal data for any changes in the learners' linguistic and interactional patterns of engagement. The review of studies is followed by those challenges that affect the implementation of CA in CALL research and a vision of the future of CA for CALL in the larger field of Applied Linguistics.","subject":"Discourse Analysis, Computer Mediated Communication, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Qualitative Research, Data Analysis, Program Implementation, Educational Research, Applied Linguistics, Sequential Approach, Affordances, Longitudinal Studies, Concept Formation","source":"CALICO Journal","publicationdateyear":2015}]
