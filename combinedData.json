[{"title": "Learning to Communicate in a Virtual World: The Case of a JFL Classroom", "author": "Yamazaki, Kasumi", "description": "The proliferation of online simulation games across the globe in many different languages offers Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) researchers an opportunity to examine how language learning occurs in such virtual environments. While there has recently been an increase in the number of exploratory studies involving learning experiences of predominantly English as a Second or Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) participants in these environments, the context of a Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL) classrooms has rarely been examined. To address this, this study investigates a Second Language Acquisition-theory driven instantiation of CALL within the context of a JFL classroom. Through a mixed-method case study approach, participants' natural acquisition of Japanese in a 3D virtual environment was examined. Data detailing participants' communicative capacities in several modalities were collected, as were their attitudes toward participation in a massively multiplayer online (MMO)-based virtual world of Tokyo. In the present study, eight sources of data from eleven university-level JFL students (n = 11) were collected and analyzed to evaluate the learning outcomes from an integrative CALL framework (Warschauer, 2004; Yamazaki, 2014). Based on both interpretative and statistical analyses of data, the major finding of the present study was that the participants, when immersed in the 3D virtual world of Tokyo, acquired contextualized communicative competence. More specifically, quantitative analyses revealed statistically significant improvement in the participants' acquisition of incidentally encountered vocabulary, in particular, kanji pronunciation and vocabulary interpretation. Qualitative analyses revealed participants' acquisition of various communicative competencies specific to the context, including persuasive talk, concept of audience, collaborative communication, and colloquial expressions. Data from a post-hoc reflection survey provided strong evidence that most students found the course to be effective, as it made them use Japanese more than in a regular class, and thereby developed more necessary communicative skills to function in Japan.

Results demonstrate that the Seven Principles of Kwanzaa were descriptive of neighborhood values and activities. Furthermore, results suggest that the PAR process of collaborating with strong community-based partners can provide teachers with a relatively easy way to access and understand a community's cultural values.

During encoding, spoken Uzbek words and corresponding visual objects were shown, and subjects either overtly repeated the words (phonological rehearsal) or overtly rehearsed numbers (phonological suppression). Phonological rehearsal improved the encoding performance. A learning-related decrease in rehearsal-specific activation was found in the left fusiform gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right cerebellum. Recollection of the phonologically rehearsed words activated the right cerebellum and left fusiform gyrus more prominently than recollection of the phonologically suppressed words in a performance-dependent manner.

The mean magnitudes of LTP induced by short and standard tetanus were not different in mutant and wild-type mice. In contrast, DP and LTP suppression were attenuated in mutant mice, whereby the mean magnitude of responses after LFS or tetanus were significantly greater than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that, in hippocampal CA1 neurons, IRBIT is involved in DP and LTP suppression, but is not essential for LTP. The attenuation of DP and LTP suppression in mice lacking IRBIT indicates that this protein, released during or after priming stimulations, determines the direction of LTP expression after the delivery of subsequent stimulations.", "subject": "Animals, Brain Hemisphere Functions, Stimuli, Neurology, Neurological Organization", "source": "Learning & Memory", "publicationdateyear": 2022}, {"title": "Prior Activation of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors Suppresses the Subsequent Induction of Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal CA1 Neurons", "author": "Fujii, Satoshi, Yamazaki, Yoshihiko, Goto, Jun-Ichi, Fujiwara, Hiroki, Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko", "description": "We investigated the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) activated by preconditioning low-frequency afferent stimulation (LFS) in the subsequent induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from mature guinea pigs. Induction of LTP in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential or the population spike by the delivery of high-frequency stimulation (HFS, a tetanus of 100 pulses at 100 Hz) to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway to CA1 neuron synapses was suppressed when group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) were activated prior to the delivery of HFS. LTP induction was also suppressed when CA1 synapses were preconditioned 60 min before HFS by LFS of 1000 pulses at 1 Hz and this effect was inhibited when the test stimulation delivered at 0.05 Hz was either halted or applied in the presence of an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, group I mGluRs, or IP3Rs during a 20-min period from 20 to 40 min after the end of LFS. Furthermore, blockade of group I mGluRs or IP[subscript 3]Rs immediately before the delivery of HFS overcame the effects of the preconditioning LFS on LTP induction.

For example, given AB (\"if A then B\"), people frequently but fallaciously infer the inverse, BA. This mode of inference, called symmetry, is logically invalid because, although it \"may\" be true, it is not \"necessarily\" true. Given pairs of conditional relations, such as AB and BC, humans reflexively perform two additional modes of inference: transitivity, whereby one (validly) infers AC; and equivalence, whereby one (invalidly) infers CA. In sharp contrast, nonhuman animals can handle transitivity but can rarely be made to acquire symmetry or equivalence. In the present study, human subjects performed logical and illogical inferences about the relations between abstract, visually presented figures while their brain activation was monitored with fMRI. The prefrontal, medial frontal, and intraparietal cortices were activated during all modes of inference. Additional activation in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex was observed during transitivity and equivalence, which may reflect the need to retrieve the intermediate stimulus (B) from memory. Surprisingly, the patterns of brain activation in illogical and logical inference were very similar. We conclude that the observed inference-related fronto-parietal network is adapted for processing categorical, but not logical, structures of association among stimuli.

Objective: This paper identified the future competencies for three careers that are representative of the demand for highly skilled personnel needed in potential industries during Industry 4.0--robotics engineers, data scientists, and food designers. Methods: This study describes the insights attained through a literature review, followed by an intensive investigation of the required competencies via focus group discussions and individual interviews. A questionnaire survey was administered and in-depth interviews were conducted to confirm the future competencies essential for the three stated careers. Finally, the robustness of the conducted analyses was verified. Results: The findings revealed the demand for a diverse mix of competencies in the current and prospective Industry 4.0 environment. Future employers are likely to highlight multidisciplinary skills that may be categorized into three crucial groups: social, personal, and methodological.

The primary objective of this work-in-progress study is to clarify this potential link between L2 task attributions, engagement, and performance. In addition, the effect of effort feedback on these three constructs is also investigated. Previous research (e.g., Amemiya &amp; Wang, 2018) has documented that effort feedback typically used with good intentions by L2 teachers may, in fact, backfire and exert negative influences on how individuals shape task attributions, which in turn lead to poor-quality task engagement and performance.

The study synthesized 55 distinct telecollaboration projects that took place in university foreign-language classes and utilized synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) tools to answer (1) What are the typical arrangements of SCMC-based telecollaboration (e.g., participants, project set-ups, and interaction set-ups)? and (2) How have SCMC-based telecollaboration projects changed over the last two decades? We identified six commonly adopted arrangements of SCMC-based telecollaboration.

To fill this knowledge gap, this study presents a systematic review of 15 EFL vocabulary learning apps that were most downloaded in China, focusing on how these apps help students develop word knowledge. The results of this study showed that most apps enabled students to access word knowledge through translating words into their native language. Notably, word knowledge was usually presented through text-plus-image and text-plus-image-plus-audio. Most of these mobile apps provided sentence examples as vocabulary learning materials. Many of these apps were integrated with game elements, especially in interactivity or feedback systems and reward systems.

Previous reviews mainly focused on only one or two narrow aspects of chatbot use in language learning. This review goes beyond merely reporting the specific types of chatbot employed in past empirical studies and examines the usefulness of chatbots in language learning, including first language learning, second language learning, and foreign language learning. Aims: The primary purpose of this review is to discover the possible technological, pedagogical, and social affordances enabled by chatbots in language learning. Materials &amp; Methods: We conducted a systematic search and identifies 25 empirical studies that examined the use of chatbots in language learning. We used the inductive grounded approach to identify the technological and pedagogical affordances, and the challenges of using chatbots for students' language learning. We used Garrison's social presence framework to analyze the social affordances of using chatbots in language learning. Results: Our findings revealed three technological affordances: timeliness, ease of use, and personalization; and five pedagogical uses: as interlocutors, as simulations, for transmission, as helplines, and for recommendations. Chatbots appeared to encourage students' social presence by affective, open, and coherent communication. Several challenges in using chatbots were identified: technological limitations, the novelty effect, and cognitive load.

Second, guided by the two original elements of SLT, four derived elements were identified, namely authenticity, social interactions and collaborations, apprenticeship learning, and beliefs and behaviours. The findings suggest the need to develop sound MALL pedagogies associated with sociocultural aspects of language learning in relevant contexts.

The research reported in this paper was designed to test such an hypothesis by differentiating between interventions combining direct instruction and mediated practice and discovery learning approaches, and with assessing the importance of programming within that model. Subjects were 100 students in the fourth through the sixth grades who had all had at least one year (30 hours) of prior experience programming in Logo. All  subjects were pretested on their ability to solve problems requiring the use of each of the five problem solving strategies under investigation, and randomly assigned by grade to one of three treatment conditions--a Logo graphics condition, a cut-paper manipulative condition, or a discovery learning, Logo projects condition. Results reveal that the model can indeed support the acquisition and transfer of four problem solving strategies--subgoals formation, forward chaining, systematic trial and error, and analogy--whereas neither discovery learning in a Logo environment nor direct instruction with concrete manipulatives practice can accomplish that. Indications are that the model can support the teaching and learning of alternative representation strategies as well. The findings support  claims for the efficacy of Logo as a medium conducive to the teaching and learning of problem solving, and argue for the use of knowledge-based instructional design and computing environments in the creation of problem solving interventions.

The main goal is to explore how to provide CF, the kind of feedback to provide, when, and by whom in order to facilitate learner's uptake and second language (L2) development (e.g., Carroll &amp; Swain, 1993; Han, 2002; Lyster &amp; Ranta, 1997). As Cohen (2018) states, aligned with more learner-centered approaches to language teaching, not only should teachers know how to deal with providing CF but they also need to promote learners' awareness as informed consumers of CF to optimize its effect in their L2 development journey with the highest level of efficiency (Cohen &amp; White, 2008). CF is defined as comments on accuracy or suitability of students' comprehension or production of a foreign/second language. The extent of CF and the ways in which learners can strategically embark on such CF is still open to debate due to the fact that there are many mediating factors influencing the efficacy of CF. Consequently, being able to propose advantageous ways of providing CF by teachers and effective use of CF by learners in L2 education settings remains a desideratum which requires a systematic review of various aspects of CF and factors contributing to its effectiveness. To this end, the current paper opens by providing a definition of CF and delineating how it is operationalized in different theoretical schemes. Categories of CF are described as are technology-based means for CF, and key dilemmas regarding CF and its effectiveness are noted. The conclusion reached is that CF must be viewed as highly complex -- especially as it concerns learners' autonomy in L2 development and in effectively strategic use of CF.

The search was conducted in two well-established databases, specifically Scopus and Web of Science, to generate sufficient data from research articles for further analysis. The findings of this systematic review indicate that NMT is an efficient tool for developing both productive (speaking and writing) and receptive (reading and listening) language skills, including mediation skills, which are relevant for translation. Moreover, the results show that NMT tools are especially suitable for advanced learners of L2, whose higher proficiency level enables them to critically reflect on the output of NMT texts more than beginners or lower-intermediate learners.

To operationalize the &quot;best practices&quot; of online learning, the Community of Inquiry framework was used as the guiding perspective. Background: There is a dearth of research employing a systematic review of English Language Teaching (&quot;ELT&quot;) practices in Indonesia carried out during the pandemic, with a view of synthesizing such practices. Such a review is deemed essential in order to provide a comprehensive description of good practices in online English classes, such as in terms of integrating technology into the ELT virtual classes, taking advantage of the experience gained from approximately more than two years of Emergency Remote Learning in the country. Methodology: This study employed the Research Review methodology, with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) 2020 to guide the process. Database (Google Scholar and Scopus) search was conducted to find research articles in English on ELT during the pandemic in Indonesia, excluding those that are conceptual in nature. The final list of 94 articles was then coded using the categories in the Community of Inquiry (&quot;CoI&quot;) framework, namely, Teaching, Cognitive, and Social Presence. Inter-rater reliability was computed to assess the risk of bias of the two reviewers. The resulting data, in the form of pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; of the CoI categories, were tabulated and described. Contribution: This research has contributed to providing a synthesis of online ELT teaching practice in Indonesia during the pandemic, specifically in describing the way teachers enacted the Teaching, Cognitive, and Social Presence online through the use of technology. This paper also describes how such deployment of technology should be accompanied by a selective choice of activities and explicit guidance from teachers, as well as teachers' supportive attitude. Consequently, this study is probably among the first to carry out a systematic review of emergency online ELT practice during the pandemic from the CoI perspective, addressing a methodological gap of extant online ELT systematic review studies. Findings: The results show that Teaching Presence constituted the highest number of pieces of evidence, with a caveat that the application of technology should be combined with clear instruction and task requirements. Next, Cognitive Presence needs to be fostered through activities that promote problem solving and critical thinking, such as online discussions, problem- or project-based learning, and self-reflection. Lastly, teachers need to make use of technologies to convey genuine concern for students and create a warm and friendly online environment as part of teaching activities that build Social Presence, although some affective expressions will need to be managed well to prevent some possible undesirable effects. Recommendations for Practitioners: English teachers in Indonesia, or elsewhere with a similar context to that in the country, can gain insights on the good practice of online learning in terms of teaching methods, media, platforms, assessments, etc. Besides, the online English teaching practices can also inform pre- and in-service teacher education programs, so as to provide technology integration training that has already been tried and empirically tested. Recommendation for Researchers: For future research, the seemingly fewer pieces of evidence found in Cognitive and Social Presence might be fertile ground for Indonesian ELT scholars to carry out research focusing on those aspects. Much research outside of Indonesia has been conducted around the theme of the application of CoI principles in online English classes, while only a few studies in this respect have been found in the Indonesian context. Impact on Society: The findings of this study may help inform educational policies with regards to blended/hybrid or restricted face-to-face meetings in schools. Future Research: This paper has contributed to exemplifying the application of CoI framework as a tool of systematic review in research. Hence, in view of the impending blended, hybrid, or limited face-to-face learning, this type of CoI-framed systematic review research can be replicated in the future to assess the effectiveness of such blended or hybrid teaching mode. Besides, future research could also inquire whether ELT teachers sustain the use of technology in the post-pandemic, on-site learning.", "subject": "English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Online Courses, COVID-19, Pandemics, Blended Learning, Best Practices, Educational Technology, Technology Uses in Education, Distance Education, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Educational Practices, Teacher Student Relationship, Language Teachers", "source": "Journal of Information Technology Education: Research", "publicationdateyear": 2022.0}, {"title": "Teacher Identity Formation through Classroom Practices in the Post-Method Era: A Systematic Review", "author": "Golzar, Jawad", "description": "This paper presents a systematic review of 37 empirical studies that explored English teacher identity, and its formation through classroom practices from 1997 to 2020.

This study employed multimodal strategies adopted from the VARK model (visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic/gestural) with the support of digital audio, video, and speech visualization technologies in an English presentation course at a university in Taiwan. Two EFL classes served respectively as the experimental group with a technology-mediated multimodal approach and the control group with a traditional oral approach. Specifically, this research evaluated the experimental participants' oral performance and explored their perceptions of this technology-mediated multimodal approach and its advantages and disadvantages as identified by the participants. Results from independent t-tests showed marginal significant progress of presentation performance in the experimental group. Descriptive statistics from the perception survey and content analysis of students' reflective responses indicated that the participants were overwhelmingly positive about technology-supported multimodal activities implemented in the oral training course but encountered psychological and technological challenges when producing multimodal assignments. Theoretically, the results support the extension of multimodal theory to EFL oral presentation education.

(2) Does interaction in the foreign language classroom seem to be effective for foreign language acquisition? (3) What factors might facilitate/impede interaction, which, in turn, positively or negatively affect output? (4) What are effective teaching methods to enhance interaction and ensure quality of output? Methodology: A systematic search for empirical studies was conducted in the selected databases, which yielded 26 studies from different parts of the world. These studies met the preset criteria concerning medium of instruction, setting, relevancy and quality. Findings: The review demonstrated that when input, interaction and output worked together, positive English learning results were achieved by EFL learners. In addition, the relationship among input, interaction, and output was likely to be influenced by such factors as language environment, task type, gender, and language proficiency. The review also showed that in the face of diversified forms of interaction, EFL teachers were capable of efficiently implementing different teaching strategies. Significance: The review not only lends support to the applicability of the interaction model in foreign language contexts, but also suggests from the pooled evidence, effective ways to apply the model in the EFL class. These findings can be used to help launch educational campaigns promoting the application of the interaction model within the EFL classroom.", "subject": "Educational Environment, Models, Interaction, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Language Acquisition, Teaching Methods, Literature Reviews, Meta Analysis, Linguistic Input, Teacher Student Relationship, Performance Factors, Language Proficiency, Task Analysis, Gender Differences, Learning Strategies, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "Malaysian Journal of Learning and Instruction", "publicationdateyear": 2014.0}, {"title": "The Role of Iranian EFL Teacher Autonomy and Reflectivity in Teacher Self-Directed Learning: A Systematic Literature Review", "author": "Amini, Mina A., Kruger, Corn\u00e8 G.", "description": "Globally various barriers hinder English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners from developing English communicative competence.

Scholarly publications outside the context of EFL underline these two constructs as necessary components of teacher self-directed learning as a prerequisite for the transformation of education. The frequent focus on these two elements in the literature in the context of EFL in Iran has motivated a systematic literature review to determine how these publications point towards a possible relationship between these two elements, with a specific focus on the role such a relationship could play in self-directed learning by EFL teachers in order to change poor learning outcomes. Using commonly agreed criteria for inclusion into the data set, the two researchers perused an initial 1006 publications identified through a systematic review of the literature, after which 43 publications were selected for analysis.

This research paper emerged from a pair of systematic reviews, aiming to synthesize available evidence regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of dosage. While quantitative aspects had been experimentally manipulated, the available evidence for &quot;dose form&quot; (tasks or activities within which teaching episodes are delivered) was less definitive. Despite this, the review uncovered insights of value to DLD research. Method: A preregistered systematic review (PROSPERO ID: CRD42017076663) adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was completed. Included papers were quasi-experimental, randomized controlled trial, or cohort analytic studies, published in any language between January 2006 and May 2019; oral language interventions with vocabulary, morphosyntax, or phonology outcomes; and participants with DLD (M = 3-18 years). The intention was to include papers in which dose form was experimentally manipulated or statistically analyzed, while quantitative dosage aspects were controlled, such that definitive conclusions about optimal dose form could be drawn and gaps in the evidence identified. Results: Two hundred and twenty-four papers met the above inclusion criteria; 27 focused on dose form. No study controlled for all quantitative aspects of dosage such that we could effectively address our original research questions. Despite this, key points of learning emerged with implications for future research. Conclusions: There is tentative evidence of advantages for explicit over implicit instruction and of the benefits of variability in input, elicited production, and gestural and other visual supports.

Ten focus group interviews were held in which the necessity of grammar instruction, its role in the foreign language (FL) curriculum, and different approaches to grammar teaching were examined in relation to student teachers' perceptions of their learners. The results show that the participants considered explicit, systematic, and isolated grammar instruction a necessary condition not only for linguistic correctness but also for advanced communicative competence. Moreover, complex interactional patterns were identified between cognitions on meaning- and form-focused approaches on the one hand and learner characteristics on the other. Conceptions of the position and role of grammar in the FL classroom were found to be mediated by student teacher perceptions of learner autonomy, motivation, intellectual capabilities, needs, and instructional preferences.

The discussion has highlighted evidence showing that the multiplicity and diversity of English uses have given rise to an acceleration in the rate of inter-variety contacts where pronunciation, as it is claimed, is the principle factor in international intelligibility. Further, it has been demonstrated that difficulty in intelligibility increases with the typological distance between interlocutors' first languages, referring to the distinct way that English pronunciation is strongly shaped by the phonetics of speakers' first language. Consequently, a careful examination of the typological distance between speakers' L1 and the target language--English--is compelling for the underpinning of the teaching and learning of pronunciation. Unfortunately, in English language teaching pedagogy, variations in pronunciation may be neglected in favor of other factors. In addition, pronunciation teaching experts stress that the study of pronunciation should be developed by locally-based educators, researchers, and authorities who are exposed to the relevant socio-cultural context, rather than being dominated by native speaker scholars based in Anglophone countries.

In spite of their frequency in typical input, modal verbs present L2 learners with difficulties, party due to their inherent complexity--modals typically have two divergent senses--a root sense and an epistemic sense. ELT textbooks and most grammar books aimed at L2 teachers present the two meanings as homophones, failing to address any systematic semantic patterning in the modal system as a whole. Additionally, ELT texts tend to present modals from a speech act perspective. In contrast, CL analyses (e.g., Langacker 1991; Nuyts 2001; Sweetser 1990; Talmy 1988) offer both a systematic, motivated representation of the relationship between the root and epistemic meanings and a rather precise representation of the semantics of each modal. To test the pedagogical effectiveness of a CL account of modals, an effects-of-instruction study was conducted with three groups of adult, high-intermediate ESL learners: a Cognitive treatment group, a Speech Acts treatment group, and a Control group. Results of an ANCOVA indicated that the Cognitive treatment group demonstrated significantly more improvement than the Speech Acts treatment group. The experiment thus lends empirical support for the position that CL, in addition to offering a compelling analytical account of language, may also provide the basis for more effective grammar instruction than that found in most current ELT teaching materials.

The 15 quality indicators used describe critical elements typically found in exemplary programs; each program component includes one or more quality indicators, as appropriate to the implementation  of that component. Each quality indicator is followed by four sets of scoring criteria that provide benchmarks for performance. Sample measures accompanying each of the indicators provide examples of evidence of the extent to which the indicator is being achieved or practices. An introductory section offers suggestions for conducting a successful self-review.

Aspects considered are: sequencing readings into the course, grammar component, vocabulary component, student preparation, outline of two day instructional treatments, the role of the teacher, and student tension. This approach leads students gradually from simple comprehension of situational reading material, often containing dialogue, through reinforcement of previously learned grammatical structures, expansion and review of students' active vocabulary, listening comprehension by means of paraphrasing, and pronunciation and intonation practice. The process culminates in a successful \"Nacherzahlung,\" or retelling of the story. Once the\"Nacherzahlung\" has been completed, students are prepared to relate their own interests, experiences, or desires which are related to the situation depicted in the readings. Suggestions for the successful implementation of this strategy are contained in the summary remarks.

While Spanish is the official language in Nicaragua, many indigenous languages, such as Miskito and Sumo-Mayangna, are also spoken--especially in the Atlantic coastal region. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport recognises the need for a flexible curriculum that reflects individual local and regional linguistic and socio-cultural characteristics, through the use of mother tongue and second language learning. The contextualisation model applied in the Atlantic coastal region of Nicaragua is therefore based on the use of a languages strategy in preparing textbooks and basic technical materials with an IBE approach, as part of the process of improving the quality of education. Thus intercultural communication is enhanced, and the need to strengthen the systematic teaching of languages, differentiating between mother tongue, second language and foreign language, is recognised. As well as explaining the contextualisation process in detail, this article discusses the conceptual differences between intercultural bilingual education (IBE) and bilingual intercultural education (BIE).

In response to this need, this paper aims to review current research on literacy interventions for East/Southeast Asian ELLs and provide practical recommendations for educators teaching literacy skills to this population. Design/methodology/approach: To identify studies for inclusion in this review, a systematic literature search was conducted of peer-reviewed studies and dissertations were published between 2001 and 2016. Articles were included in the authors' review, if those described a literacy intervention where the sample was entirely East and/or Southeast Asian ELLs, or, if the sample included other groups, the study provided an analysis of the intervention's effectiveness specifically for the East or Southeast Asian ELLs in the study. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Findings: The authors' search yielded seven studies. The authors found three main contributors to effective literacy instruction for this population: culturally relevant instruction, family involvement and encouraging first language (L1) development to facilitate language and literacy in English. Results indicated that interventions that consider a student's cultural style (i.e. preference toward a teacher-centered classroom) or included cultural familiar themes/texts were found to be more effective. In addition, strategies that encouraged the development of L1, such as the use of dual-language books, explicitly teaching contrastive analysis and providing the same book to be read at home and a school were all correlated with greater literacy gains. Finally, facilitating home-school communication seemed to contribute to the efficacy of several of the interventions. Research limitations/implications: This paper reveals the need to expand the current knowledge base on effective literacy instruction and intervention for East/Southeast Asian ELL students, especially research on population validity, given the specific needs of this growing population. This review is limited by the small number of relevant studies and the fact that not all East/Southeast Asian languages or ethnic groups were represented. There is still a great need for future research to determine what methods or combination of factors are effective with East/Southeast Asian ELLs of various ages and needs. Practical implications: The findings from this paper have generated practical recommendations for educators teaching literacy skills to East/Southeast Asian ELL students, such as--tailor literacy instruction to be culturally relevant, design interventions around student's preferred learning style, encourage parent/family involvement, provide bilingual instruction and bilingual reading materials and provide parents with books and information about the literacy curriculum. Social implications: This paper also reveals the need to expand the current knowledge base on effective literacy instruction and intervention for East/Southeast Asian ELL students, especially research on population validity, given the specific needs of this growing population. Originality/value: Based on an extensive literature search, this is the first paper to review and summarize the research on literacy interventions for East/Southeast Asian ELLs over the past 15 years.

Focusing on the L2 reading of upper elementary, middle and high school students in L1 settings, this study aims to carefully, but critically, explore the major research studies published in the past three decades. In particular, it uses sociocultural and critical frameworks that view language as a social phenomenon and literacy as a constellation of socially contextualized practices to explore the issue of L2 reading. Design/methodology/approach: To identify key findings about L2 reading, a systematic literature review of studies examining L2 reading in L1 settings was conducted. A critical examination and analysis of 91 studies on L2 reading for upper elementary students (Grades 4-12) are presented here. Based on the literature review, the major issues addressed in the previous section are revisited, and the requirements of future research on L2 reading are discussed. Findings: Three major changes have taken place in L2 reading studies--from monolingual/L1-based research to multilingual/L2-based research; developing the socially situated model of literacy (literacies); and adopting a sociocultural and critical lens: L2 reading and L2 reading assessment. Based on the critical review of the major research studies published in the past three decades, this paper identifies the research and approach required to advance the field of L2 reading: the continua of L1 and L2 reading, macro-micro analysis of L2 reading context and diversification of L2 reading research. Originality/value: Based on a systematic literature review, it demonstrates the current trends in L2 reading research, to examine the key findings and implications, and to identify what additional research or paradigms are required to advance the field.

Most of the debate on grammar teaching focused on the rationales for teaching it, rather than on the linguistic content that should be taught. At the same time, there appears to be a renewed interest in restoring the bond between linguistic theory and grammar education. Previous research has suggested that it would be highly desirable to gain a clearer picture of this content. Which concepts are being discussed in the literature on grammar education, and to what extent are these compatible with modern linguistics, in other words: is the literature on grammar teaching up-to-date? This systematic literature review is the first to dive into these questions. Results indicate: (1) most of the concepts in the literature on grammar teaching are from traditional grammar. To a limited extent, there are also concepts from modern linguistic theory that are being discussed, but mostly implicitly; (2) most concepts are not being motivated because they are meaningful in modern theoretical linguistics, but because they reflect traditional classroom practices and policy.

Foreign language ECEC centres familiarise very young children with a foreign language, and in general also expose them to the majority language. This review synthesises research on the effects of foreign language ECEC on children's development of the foreign language, majority language, first language, and wellbeing, as well as programme-related and child-related factors that influence language development and wellbeing. The reviewed studies indicate that foreign language ECEC fosters foreign language development, without negatively impacting the majority and first language. Children can experience positive wellbeing in these programmes, but only if programmes are play-based and if the language policy is not too strict. Some studies report that programme characteristics, such as input quantity, language policy, and teacher strategies, modulate the effects of foreign language ECEC on language development and wellbeing. Few of the reviewed studies examined child characteristics, but the available findings indicate that children's age, as well as their temperament and in-class behaviour, are related to foreign language learning.

It critically reviews the major conceptualizations of SLTE in relation to the key conceptualizations of second language (L2) teaching. The review identifies shortcomings in traditional perspectives on L2 teaching and SLTE and the need to re-conceptualize SLTE as a field. A recent re-conceptualization of SLTE is seen through the shift towards a social constructivist perspective, a redefinition of the knowledge base, research that responds to the epistemological shift, and a sociocultural perspective on SLTE. The existing literature shows that although there is now a growing body of research that looks into the various dimensions of SLTE, few studies have gained a comprehensive and systematic view of the complexities of SLTE. The paper argues that a sociocultural perspective, especially a combination of Vygotsky's genetic method and Engestr\u00f6m's proposal of the third generation of activity theory, has become a powerful way of understanding L2 teacher learning, which corresponds to the need for a re-conceptualization of SLTE.

These countries were selected because they have similar characteristics: teaching and learning occur in a multilingual context; their language in education policies are similar; transition from mother tongue to English happens during the early grades; and most of the learners learn mathematics in English--a language which for most is not their first/home language. Research outputs between 2006 and 2016 from the three countries were sourced from peer-reviewed mathematics and general education journals, monitoring and evaluation reports, and book chapters. Findings from the study revealed that there is a lack of longitudinal studies that investigate the impact of language on the teaching and learning of mathematics and that there are few studies on how teachers are and should be trained to teach mathematics in the early grades. The study also found that the implementation of the language in education policies in the three different focus countries is fraught with difficulties owing to a number of factors, amongst them the fact that the indigenous languages are not yet fully developed as academic languages.

Research in the teaching of English must be preceded by research in English, language variation, and native language acquisition and by further work in descriptive linguistics. A significant problem in current language research is that the different disciplines engaging in it begin with different assumptions concerning the nature of language variation. Anthropologists and linguists consider variation normal manifestation of difference, while psychologists and educators view variation as a deviation from a norm. More emphasis should be placed on training teachers to hear, distinguish, and analyze the language of their students. Teachers must learn about the  systematic nature of language, how languages differ from each other, how they change, the difference between oral and written symbolization, and the structure of communication. Techniques used today for evaluating a child's language ability frequently discriminate against nonstandard English-speaking children. It must be remembered that every child comes to the first grade with a relatively well developed and systematic language which cannot be characterized as random or illogical. More research into the problem of stigmatized speech is also needed.

Consequently, secondary school biology students find difficult to cope with learning in the context of foreign language. This paper aims at presenting the investigation on how pedagogical language strategies can effectively support teachers and learners during teaching and learning of systematic invertebrates in Tanzania secondary schools. Data were collected using the lesson observation checklist, lesson evaluation sheet, interview with teachers and focus group discussions with learners. A total of 60 sessions, each of 80 minutes were observed in 10 schools. A total of 40 teachers and 400 level four students of the ordinary level participated in the study. Quantitatively, paired sample t-test, means, standard deviations and percentages were used to evaluate and compare changes in learners' performance in pre- and post-tests. Further, thematic analysis was employed to analyse qualitative data. Key findings from the study indicated that the majority of teachers who participated in the training managed to set competencies and the activities to reinforce the achievements of developed competencies. Again, teachers and learners had a progressive significant improvement over introduced pedagogical language strategies. Overall, there was a statistically significant difference between pre- and post- intervention. Interviews with teachers and focus group discussions with students revealed that the strategies increased students' interactions and activeness in class, which in turn, improved the learning of biology content through the English language.

In this qualitative study, the investigator conducted interviews and lesson observations to uncover how 12 fourth- and fifth-grade teachers used this program. Participants were asked several questions that involved how they have used the systematic FELD program. Contributors were asked what strategies they implemented, along with acknowledging those practices that were most and least successful, obstacles encountered and overcame, and lessons learned from using the systematic FELD program. The study revealed how teachers approach instruction based on their knowledge, training, and experience when deciding appropriate strategies to put into practice. Teachers indicated their perceptions, methods of practice, and apprehensions toward the systematic FELD program and why it is not being used. Data analysis consisted of a comparing data collected that involved sorting data into themes and categories. Interviews and observations revealed that teachers used many instructional approaches and developed a risk-free environment in which ELL students could be successful; however, none of the participating teachers used the systematic FELD program in their classrooms. Teachers used alternative methods based on their experiences from previous training to educate and support ELL students. The attitudes of each participant showed a range of perception and concern regarding the effectiveness of the systematic FELD program.

Accordingly, teachers more than ever are encouraged or even explicitly instructed to use different tools inside the classroom.

Therefore, the current research attempts to adapt instructional design principles inside EFL classrooms to ensure a productive E-learning environment, through methodical control of the utilization of information and communication technologies. In pursuit of this endeavor, the current paper examines first, through a literature review, the concept of instructional design and its principles and how they can be incorporated inside traditional EFL classrooms. The methodology opted for relies on quantitative data collected from an experiment conducted on two middle school 4 MS (Middle School) classes. An experimental group received five lessons in which content was designed using Adobe Captivate and adhering to instructional design principles. On the other hand, a control group received five lessons with the same objective, yet with regular videos and media gathered from YouTube.

Most lists of pronunciation errors for speakers of a particular first language (L1) are based on the experience of expert linguists or teachers of English as a second language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL). Such lists are useful, but they are also subject to blind spots for less noticeable errors while suggesting that other more noticeable errors are more important. This exploratory study tested whether using a database of read sentences would reveal recurrent errors that had been overlooked by expert opinions. We did a systematic error analysis of advanced L1 Arabic learners of English (n = 4) using L2 Arctic, a publicly available collection of 1,132 phonetically-balanced English sentences read aloud by 24 speakers of six language backgrounds.

The findings give an empirically supported description of persistent pronunciation errors for Arabic learners of English. Although necessarily limited in scope, the study demonstrates how similar datasets can be used regardless of the L1 being investigated.

This paper presents a study undertaken to evaluate an online Master's of Arts (MA) in CALL programme in the Republic of Cyprus. The investigation was based on a conceptual multidimensional e-learning evaluation model rated by the students. Data were collected from 25 graduate students via an online anonymous survey. This focussed on the participants' perceptions of the value of the following aspects: (1) their engagement; (2) the course and its organisation, teaching mode, and materials; (3) course strengths; (4) course aspects most helpful to learning; and (5) course aspects which were obstacles to learning. This paper discusses the findings and offers some first recommendations for further improvement to the MA in CALL programme.

The purpose of this study was to explore teacher-related factors in beyond Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) Level 2 vocabulary instruction to adults in a classroom setting in intensive language-training programs. The conceptual framework consisted of the theory of noticing hypothesis, synformy, and the comprehensible input hypothesis. Research questions addressed instructors' experiences when teaching vocabulary and synforms, the training they received on how to teach vocabulary, and the resources they need. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 9 language instructors of less-commonly taught languages. Data were analyzed using an open-coding strategy. Results indicated participants were uncertain about their roles in teaching and selecting vocabulary and about the use of strategies and approximate number of words and kinds of words that students require to achieve general proficiency (ILR Level 3). Participants reported they had no systematic approach to teaching vocabulary or synforms. Participants also expressed a desire to receive training on vocabulary learning strategies, evidence-based best practices in teaching vocabulary, and facilitating vocabulary retention. Findings may be used to guide directors of intensive language programs in developing systematic approaches to selecting and teaching vocabulary.

Instead we aim to inculcate in our students a propensity for open-ended searches, and an observe-and-borrow-chunks mentality, oriented to copying models from a corpus to enrich and render more accurate their written production in particular.

Data was collected by a 5-Likert type questionnaire with 15 items that addressed a range of key issues in grammar instruction, particularly direct (explicit) or indirect (integrated) grammar instruction. The study has provided a number of valuable insights, particularly in relation to teachers' beliefs about grammar instruction. The representation of grammar instruction that arises from participant teachers' responses in this study is one characterized by systematic explicit grammar teaching with regular opportunities for grammar practice, not in isolation but in relation to skills-oriented work. Moreover, teachers with higher English proficiency levels and higher degrees (master's/doctorate) showed stronger belief towards teaching grammar indirectly. Teachers of adult learners showed a higher tendency towards direct grammar teaching.

Course  content would include specialized terminology and in-depth analysis of such topics as the labor movement, trade unions, employers' associations, plant-level industrial relations, government role, collective bargaining, and co-determination. While there is little instructional material available specifically on West Germany, there is much on labor law, trade unions, employers, crafts, labor history, and economics of collective bargaining.

A systematic analysis of participating teachers' cognition formation and re-formation process suggests the highly individual nature of teachers' cognitions. EFL researchers and teachers, teacher educators, teacher education policymakers, university administrators and EFL textbook writers could draw on the findings of the study to provide better resources to implement the teaching of EFL writing more effectively. The study has adopted a mixed-methods approach, whose quantitative results show the patterns and differences of teacher cognition among teachers of different backgrounds and with different schooling, education and working experiences. The qualitative findings show in detail teachers' cognition formation and reformation processes and the factors contributing to such processes, revealing convergence and divergence of teachers' stated cognitions, with a focus on the discrepancy between teacher cognition and teaching practice.

Reflective practice generally means that EMI teachers subject their philosophy of practice, principles, theories and practices to a critical analysis so that they can take more responsibility for their actions. Reflective practice allows EMI teachers to act in a deliberate, intentional manner. Reflective practice involves EMI teachers systematically looking at what they do, how they do it, why they do it, what the outcomes are in terms of student learning, and what actions EMI teachers will take as a result of knowing all of this information. Thus experience combined with systematic reflection can lead to professional growth so that we can become more effective language teachers.

Four tutors were selected from a group of fourth grade volunteers. The four tutees were second language learners having difficulties with acquiring sufficient English language skills to succeed in the grade. The skills for the lessons were culled from known texts in second language learning and developed into two sets of lessons, one for the tutee and one for the tutor. Ten lessons were taught over a period of two months. However, it could not be determined whether the improvement was due largely to the effects of peer tutoring. Peer tutoring enabled the second language learners to learn in a non-threatening  atmosphere, to obtain individualized instruction and to receive immediate feedback to their learning needs. For the teachers of second language learners, the results imply that there is a need to reexamine their roles, methods and techniques in aiming for individualization of instruction. The evidence suggests that the method of peer tutoring for second language learners warrants a more systematic and detailed study.

It is of significance to analyze and study these characteristics. The paper uses the corpus approach to study the misuse of tenses in Chinese College students' CET-4 compositions of the sub-corpus of &quot;Non-major College Students&quot; in the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC). Nine types of misuse are identified, and analysis is made of the causes of each type. It is found that the misuse of tenses in Chinese college students' English compositions is mainly in the simple present tense and the simple past tense; the wrong collocation of tenses is mostly in the kind of complex sentence with the main clause and subordinate clause both indicating the future action and the subordinate clause using the simple present tense; as for the two special words &quot;could&quot; and &quot;would&quot; with both declarative and subjunctive usages, Chinese students often get confused and misuse them; students have vague understanding of the time concept indicated by the different tenses. Based on the analysis, the author tentatively provides some interpretations for these mistakes: many problems exist in the teaching of grammar in Chinese English teaching, and the teaching of tenses is not systematic and the focus of teaching and tests is not in accordance with the actual uses of tenses; students are affected by inter-lingual transfer and intra-lingual transfer when making English sentences. At last, some suggestions are offered by the author for the teaching of tenses: teachers should combine systematic teaching of tenses with the teaching of tenses in actual contexts and students should try to write English compositions using different tenses.", "subject": "Foreign Countries, College Students, English (Second Language), Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Morphemes, Verbs, Writing (Composition), Error Analysis (Language), Error Correction, Interlanguage, Computational Linguistics", "source": "English Language Teaching", "publicationdateyear": 2011.0}, {"title": "Working with Multilingual Learners and Vocabulary Knowledge for Secondary Schools: Developing Word Consciousness", "author": "Cox, Robyn, O'Brien, Katherine, Walsh, Maureen, West, Helen", "description": "This paper reports on a 10 week vocabulary focused intervention based on the Word Generation program (Snow, 2002, 2010; SERP, 2011) in primary and secondary schools, which demonstrated clear improvements, particularly with students who are EAL/D learners.

It is the ability to communicate in culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate ways with speakers from other cultures. Being able to apologize is one component of this competence.

This pragmatic competence is gradually acquired in one's foreign language education, alongside the building blocks of the foreign language, viz. grammar and lexis. Even though the teaching of pragmatics is a complex undertaking and often challenging to plan in a systematic way, teachers can follow certain principles when designing tasks and preparing lessons in which learners' apology competence is targeted. This article provides a synthesis of relevant research findings on apologies and suggests principles for tasks and activities in the classroom that help to attain pragmatic teaching goals.", "subject": "Pragmatics, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Intercultural Communication, Communicative Competence (Languages), Grammar, Class Activities, Cultural Awareness, Language Research, Task Analysis, Educational Objectives, Vocabulary Development", "source": "ELT Journal", "publicationdateyear": 2015.0}, {"title": "Applied Logic for the ESL Classroom.", "author": "Spanos, George", "description": "Restatement and paraphrase, and the syntactic operations that generate them, can serve as the basis for techniques involving explanation, and the production of new sentences in the second language classroom. The basic operations involved are known intuitively by the native speaker but must be taught and practiced if the ESL learner is to get a functional knowledge of English. In addition to practicing paraphrases by such transformations as active-passive, the logical operations underlying the transformations can be defined. Selected with particular purposes in mind, individual sentences can serve as the starting point from which classroom exercises can be created which train or test the students in the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of the language. When students are  made aware of the underlying logic, systematic application of paraphrase activities results in increased risk-taking, participation and group correction, and a rapid grasp of the logical concepts and operations. Using the operations and concepts defined here, the teacher can design exercises centered on a particular structure which can help the student get a better command of meaning at the same time. Examples are given of the technique as well as of exercises in the four skills, and testing and review exercises.

Children with language learning difficulties who receive morphological-based intervention show generalization of taught derivational morphemes to untaught words. Children with language learning difficulties have shown clinically significant improvement on standardized vocabulary tests following morphological-based intervention. Conclusions: An overall aim of a morphological-based vocabulary intervention is for students to strategically apply their knowledge of derivational morphemes and root words to predict meanings of unknown morphologically complex words. There is high-level evidence supporting the effects of morphological-based instruction on vocabulary for typically developing children. However, additional research is needed to firmly establish the effectiveness of morphological-based strategies for the population of students with language learning difficulties.

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework of collaborative peer feedback which structures feedback dialogue into three distinct phases and outlines the learning processes involved in each of them. Then, we present a web-based platform, called Synergy, which is designed to facilitate collaborative peer feedback as conceptualised in the theoretical framework.

Such instruction is believed to lead learners to systematic understanding of the target features faster and more efficiently. This study reports on a classroom implementation of innovative language lessons on English phrasal verbs in order to support this view. The design of the lessons is based on Vygotskyan pedagogical theory, concept-based instruction, the key concepts of which are materialization, verbalization and internalization (Vygotsky, 1981, 1983, Gal&apos;perin, 1969). The content of the lessons comes from cognitive linguistic notions, in particular conceptual metaphor (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980) and image schema (Johnson, 1987). Class instruction was designed to highlight the systematicity of the semantics of phrasal verbs and to reinforce learners&apos; conceptual understanding with various learning activities. Six 50 minute class sessions introduced students to the semantics of three particles, out, up and over. A total of 23 international teaching assistants were enrolled in the course taught at a North American research university. Participants&apos; performances in various tasks including in-class tests and homework assignments were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to investigate learner development. The quantitative data consists of multiple-choice tests that assessed whether students were capable of choosing an appropriate phrasal verb in a series of varied sentential contexts. The qualitative datasets were collected from following tasks: verbalizations, definitions and two explanation tasks. The tasks were not only designed to reveal effect of instruction, but also to reinforce the learning process. The analyses of the various data sets showed that CBI enhanced understanding for the majority of students meanings of phrasal verbs in a more systematic manner and to properly externalize that understanding. Their performance significantly improved and the guessing rate decreased. Transfer to new items and particles also occurred. In addition, their explanations became semantically rich and image-oriented. Their explanations indicated that the SCOBAs (Schemas for the Orienting Basis of Action) developed to accompany the explanation of the metaphorical properties of phrasal verbs were clearly instrumental for understanding the motivated nature of particle use. The overall encouraging results point to the need for meaning-oriented grammar instruction that draws learners&apos; attention to the conceptual bases of grammatical features including seemingly arbitrary phrasal verbs and other idiomatic expressions. This type of instruction is more advantageous in that it can promote conceptual understanding, theoretical thinking and practical application.

Examination of several Japanese-English textbooks for junior high school students revealed that the materials were prepared in grammar-oriented sequences, and that the dialogues provided were often artificial, without overt consideration for rules of speaking. Textbooks used at the private language institutes were also felt to have questionable authenticity and utility in their subject matter.  Professors at two national Japanese universities, interviewed concerning the sociolinguistics training of Japanese English teachers, acknowledged the importance of sociolinguistics in language teaching despite the fact that there was no systematic teaching in this field in either institution. Without knowledge of rules of speaking, misunderstandings, sometimes with profound effects, are inevitable. Japanese learners of English have difficulty developing good relationships with native speakers because they miss opportunities to promote further interaction.

The key word in this proposal is \"system.\" Teachers can, and do, add cultural comments on a hit and miss basis as they teach the language, but this is not enough for the student who is thoroughly grounded in his own cultural perspective and, more often than not, has well entrenched negative cultural stereotypes about the speakers of the language he is learning. Teaching a second language can be thought of in terms of three interrelated areas of communication: the speaker himself, the form of dialogue between  two native speakers, and the way native speakers describe the world they live in. By applying anthropological insights into the concept of culture, a ten-theme system for developing the sociocultural context of a second language has been devised. The principal value of these sociocultural patterns is that they provide a systematic means for planning themes that can utilize the content presented in the standard language textbook and help to create the sociocultural context for teaching the language.

Furthermore, pronunciation is the first indication of social identity, with all that means for one's integration in or exclusion from a speech community. But nevertheless, phonetics practice takes a back seat in foreign language teaching programmes, in teacher training, in teaching material and, above all, in research work, and this is particularly true in the case of teaching Spanish as a second language. In order to redress this situation, researchers from nine universities have put together an oral corpus and developed a series of resources, tools and applications which can all be accessed at a website for cooperative and interactive work called Fono.ele. The corpus is the first to gather together a significant and representative number of oral recordings of learners of Spanish. It also breaks new ground in embarking on a general study of the pronunciation of Spanish/L2 in relation to social, cultural and educational factors. In addition, it makes available data regarding oral production and auditory perception. As for its applications, they enable those who may be interested (researchers and/or teachers) to handle and manage the speech extracts from the oral corpus, to carry out searches in the phonological errors data base, to obtain quantitative and statistical data, to interconnect text, sound and data, and to devise training exercises.

The researcher intends here to analyse and comment on teachers' English teaching beliefs. It is generally accepted that teaching is greatly affected by the belief systems of its practitioners-teachers. Teachers' beliefs influence their consciousness, teaching attitude, teaching methods and teaching policies, and finally, learners' development. Horwitz (1987) also states rightly that the formation of teachers' educational beliefs in language teaching/ learning process will influence, though indirectly, on forming effective teaching methods and will bring about the improvement of learners' language learning abilities. In Indian context, there is dearth of research evaluating teachers' beliefs about English teaching. This study explores teachers' beliefs regarding teaching English to children and tries to explore whether medium of instruction makes any difference in their beliefs. It also intends to determine what similar and different beliefs might be held by in-service teachers from two different mediums. A total of 100 pre-service teachers are the subjects of this study. In order to recognize these teachers' specific beliefs in a more systematic way, a research instrument, The Questionnaire of Primary School Pre-service English Teachers' Teaching Beliefs was developed.

A growing demand for English education has further limited children's literacy achievement. Despite a strong evidence base in favour of using systematic phonics for building English literacy skills, many teachers in India continue to use rote-methods of literacy instruction. Objectives: We aimed to examine the efficacy of GraphoLearn (GL) English Rime, a computer-assisted reading intervention, in improving the foundational literacy skills of 1st and 2nd grade students who were attending an English medium school in India. Methods: A total of 136 students across 6 classrooms were randomly allocated to play either GL or a control math game over a 5-week intervention period. Students were pre- and post-tested on various English literacy skills using tasks built into the GL software as well as through oral and paper-based tasks. Results and Conclusions: Students who played GL showed significantly greater and faster development on in-game measures of letter-sound knowledge, rime unit recognition, and word recognition as compared to students who did not play GL. In addition, GL resulted in greater effects on these measures for students with stronger English literacy skills prior to the start of the intervention. No differences were found between groups on the oral and paper-based tasks. Implications: GL was able to quickly and effectively teach critical sub-skills for reading.

These goals and needs depend on a variety of factors, which may include the learners' uses of English (in what settings and for what purposes), their motivation to identify with specific English-speaking groups, the degree to which they want to sound like native speakers, and the frequency with which they speak English. Although pronunciation is part of the curriculum in many adult education programs, it is often not included in state language proficiency standards or addressed systematically in instruction. In addition, some English as a second language (ESL) teachers working with adult learners do not have training in teaching pronunciation. As a result, teachers may not be able to identify the patterns of or reasons for learners' pronunciation problems or have a systematic way to teach the sound, stress, intonation, and rhythm patterns of English.

Students work at a reading level appropriate for their achievement level, progress through the program at their own rate, and work, for the most part, on an independent basis.

One can determine the content of learning by identifying the educational, occupational, and interactional tasks learners need to perform in the target language. One can view the process of learning not as interlanguage development but as development of proficiency in functional task-related skills. The teacher, the syllabus, and the instructional materials assume a central role in teaching for proficiency since  providing opportunities for proficiency development requires systematic needs analysis, task analysis, goal setting, and development and evaluation of teaching and learning activities.

Figurative language offers a model for figurative education, in which teachers treat their practice as metaphors treat language, a move that opens education towards complexity and ambiguity.

Definitions of culture and culture education vary greatly, but recent work supports the concept that  cultural competence and communicative competence are closely related. As a culture learner, the ESL student needs systematic presentation of the major values and norms governing everyday life; as a result techniques such as experiential culture learning, cross-cultural comparison, and viewing culture through metaphor have been suggested.

The objective was to delineate the current research progress in the field and to further understand the challenges. Background: The study analyzed articles published between 2015 and 2021. Methodology: The qualitative research method was employed. Five steps were taken to steer the review. 200 articles were scrutinized; 64 were retained. Contribution: Prior research on AI in ELT has not investigated how the literature is progressing or what areas of AI are being covered. Without a holistic picture, some important research findings could be missed. Understanding how studies on AI in ELT are designed and implemented will contribute to a greater understanding of the existing state of research. Findings: Findings show that there is a promising future for AI in ELT. AI in ELT yielded positive results in terms of optimizing the English language skills, translation, assessment, recognition, attitude, satisfaction, etc. It was also found out that more and more articles on the topic are being published; the mixed research method is the most commonly used, higher education level is the most sampled, students as participants are the most sampled, and most studies developed novel AI-based systems. Various AI approaches have been identified in the reviewed studies, including machine learning, neural network, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, deep learning, decision tree, expert system, natural language processing, data mining, cloud computing, and edge computing. However, AI in ELT is still in its infancy, where little research has been conducted and gaps in the literature are still present, especially in terms of inherent issues related to body language, gestures, expressions, emotions, translation, lack of elaborate description of teaching material used for learning driven by AI, uncertainties and vagueness with regards to what can be considered under the realm of AI, and most authors being outside of the ELT discipline. Recommendations for Practitioners: This literature review is likely to provide practitioners with an overview of the current adopted technology, research method, instruments and/or tools, educational level, language skill, and the effects reported by the AI-based studies for designing effective systems for the use of AI in their ELT classrooms. Recommendations for Researchers: Researchers need to conduct research on AI in ELT along with a detailed in-depth description of the methodology, research design, and the proposed systems used to achieve AI in ELT. Furthermore, it is recommended that researchers explore the efficiency of AI-based systems used in previous research and ensure their relevance and functionality. They are also required to provide in-depth analysis of the challenges inherent to systems that have been highlighted in the literature, which will maximize the potentials of these AI-based technologies. Impact on Society: The findings of this paper can provide visualization of research findings that could particularly benefit researchers, educators, and AI specialists who are involved in the study of the applications of AI in ELT.

In this context, internalizing knowledge carries the meaning of being able to remember language, and purposefully and accurately use it context, including appropriacy of language, and aspects of correct pronunciation, intonation, stress patterns and connected speech, these being the elements of teaching and practice that are very often lacking in asynchronous, online, instructional video. Background: Knowledge Management is the field of study, and the practice, of discovering, capturing, sharing, and applying knowledge, typically with a view to translating individuals' knowledge into organizational knowledge. In the field of education, it is the sharing of instructors' knowledge for students to be able to learn and usefully apply that knowledge. In recent pandemic times, however, the mode of instruction has, of necessity, transitioned from face-to-face learning to an online environment, transforming the face of education as we know it. While this mode of instruction and knowledge sharing has many advantages for the online learner, in both synchronous and asynchronous learning environments, it presents certain challenges for language learners due to the absence of interaction and corrective feedback that needs to take place for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) to master language acquisition. Unlike other subjects where the learner has recourse to online resources to reinforce learning through referencing external information, such as facts, figures, or theories, to be successful in learning a second language, the ESL learner needs to be able to learn to process thought and speech in that language; essentially, they need to learn to think in another language, which takes time and practice. Methodology: The research employs a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the scope and extent to which the subject is covered by existing research in this field, and the findings thereof. Contribution: Whilst inconclusive in relation to internalizing language through online, asynchronous instructional video, through its exploratory nature, the research contributes towards the body of knowledge in online learning through the drawing together of various studies in the field of learning through asynchronous video through improving video and instructional quality. Findings: The findings of the systematic literature review revealed that there is negligible research in this area, and while information exists on blended and flipped modes of online learning, and ways to improve the quality and delivery of instructional video generally, no prior research on the exclusive use of asynchronous videos as an aid to internalizing English as a second language were found. Recommendations for Practitioners: From this research, it is apparent that there is considerably more that practitioners can do to improve the quality of instructional videos that can help students engage with the learning, from which students stand a much better chance of internalizing the learning. Recommendations for Researchers: For researchers, the absence of existing research is an exciting opportunity to further explore this field. Impact on Society: Online learning is now globally endemic, but it poses specific challenges in the field of second language learning, so the development of instructional videos that can facilitate this represents a clear benefit to all ESL learners in society as a whole. Future Research: Clearly the absence of existing research into whether online asynchronous instructional videos can act as an aid to internalizing the acquisition of English as a second language would indicate that this very specific field is one that merits future research. Indeed, it is one that the author intends to exploit through primary data collection from the production of a series of asynchronous, online, instructional videos.", "subject": "Knowledge Management, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Pronunciation, Accuracy, Language Usage, Intonation, Video Technology, Pandemics, COVID-19, Online Courses, Asynchronous Communication, Language Processing, Educational Quality, Educational Improvement, Educational Change, Higher Education, Instructional Effectiveness", "source": "Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice", "publicationdateyear": 2022.0}, {"title": "Learners' Descriptions of German Pronunciation, Vocabulary, and Grammar: A Folk Linguistic Account", "author": "Chavez, Monika", "description": "Following a folk linguistic approach, this investigation of first-, second- and fourth-year learners' accounts of German found that (1) few had held pre-conceived notions about German prior to language study; (2) most pre-conceived notions concerned German pronunciation; (3) pre-conceived notions about vocabulary were most likely to influence the decision to study German; and (4) among current perceptions of German, learners (a) believe German to be more \"systematic\" than English; (b) are virtually exclusively concerned with rules of \"accuracy\" (not appropriateness); (c) tend to judge the \"merits\" of German rules in comparison with English but also the Romance languages; (d) consider grammar more different between English and German than vocabulary and pronunciation; and (e) register no observable differences across different years of study or between German and non-German majors.", "subject": "Contrastive Linguistics, Romance Languages, German, Majors (Students), Pronunciation, Student Attitudes, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Vocabulary, Grammar, Language Attitudes, English", "source": "Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German", "publicationdateyear": 2009.0}, {"title": "The New English.", "author": "Chisholm, William", "description": "This book is an introduction to the \"new\" English which utilizes knowledge gained from studies and basic research to achieve practical, intelligent goals for instruction in English.

This framework incorporates two approaches: 1) promoting explicit lexical instruction and learning strategies; and 2) encouraging the use of implicit lexical instruction and learning strategies. The three most crucial explicit lexical instruction and learning strategies are acquiring decontextualized lexis, using dictionaries and inferring from context. Implicit lexical instruction and learning can take many forms including the use of integrated task sets and narrow reading; however, this framework emphasizes extensive reading, which is arguably the primary way that EFL learners can build their reading vocabulary to an advanced level. The principal notion underlying this framework is that the most effective and efficient lexical development will occur in multifaceted curriculums that achieve a pedagogically sound balance between explicit and implicit activities for L2 learners at all levels of their development.", "subject": "Learning Strategies, Vocabulary Development, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Teaching Methods", "source": "Reading in a Foreign Language", "publicationdateyear": 2005.0}, {"title": "Vocabulary Development: A Neglected Phase of Reading Instruction.", "author": "Dale, Edgar", "description": "In our concern to improve the quality of reading, we have neglected vocabulary development; in our zeal to teach children to pronounce words, we have neglected teaching them word meanings.

Though language inheritance, background, and competencies are outgrowths of out-of-school factors, attempts must be made to compensate for deficiencies of these sorts when encountered. Because children learn words individually and in relation to personal conceptual systems, vocabulary instruction should be viewed as concept building. Thus the generative potential of words, the  commonality of roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and the utility of given words in numerous contexts should be emphasized. Finally, a systematic vocabulary development program involves student mastery of the technical terms and concepts needed for instruction in all subjects.

Grounded narrative is a data reduction methodology of qualitative reporting evidenced by the data. It is used to portray vividly and authentically the Fijian educational setting by highlighting the salient cultural characteristics that typify Fijian teaching. The paper depicts a fictitious culturally-extreme Fijian rural school, an ideal type. This description effectively highlights the sociocultural determinants of Fijian school ethos by reporting extreme aspects of English teaching and daily school management. The first part of the narrative described the school's main physical and management features. The second part focused on the teaching and learning of English in  the Fijian rural context. The teachers' methodological strategies for teaching English are outlined. It is concluded that systematic teaching of students to the Fijian national English examination is inimical to broader pedagogical objectives, because it ignores the fact that English is not the language of daily life. This finding has relevance for the training of teachers and managers for rural Fijian secondary schools. It underscores that teacher training, without reference to the determining socio-cultural characteristics of Fiji is unlikely to significantly broaden the pedagogy of rural English teachers and hence the English language proficiency of their students.

Although the term &quot;whole language&quot; is not commonly used today, programs based on its premises remain popular. These approaches may pay lip service to reading science, but they fail to incorporate the content and instructional methods proven to work best with students learning to read. Some districts openly shun research-based practices, while others fail to provide clear, consistent leadership for principals and teachers, who are left to reinvent reading instruction, school by school. The purpose of this guide is to help educators and parents spot programs that truly are research based -- and those that are not. Moats exposes scientifically untenable practices in reading instruction, including: (1) use of memorization, picture cues, and contextual guessing for teaching word recognition instead of direct, systematic teaching of decoding and comprehension skills; (2) substitution of teacher modeling and reading aloud for explicit, organized instruction; (3) rejection of systematic and explicit phonics, spelling, or grammar instruction; (4) confusion of phonemic awareness with phonics; (5) reliance on leveled and trade books to organize instruction; and (6) use of whole-language approaches for English language learners. The author suggests ways of separating good from poor programs and explains that good reading programs: (1) use valid screening measures to find children who are at risk and provide them with effective, early instruction in phonology and oral language; in word recognition and reading fluency; and in comprehension and writing skills; (2) interweave several components of language (such as speech sounds, word structure, word meaning, and sentence structure) into the same lessons; (3) build fluency in both underlying reading skills and text reading, using direct methods such as repeated readings of the same text; (4) incorporate phonemic awareness into all reading instruction, rather than treating it as an isolated element; (5) go beyond the notion of phonics as the simple relationship between letters and sounds to include lessons on word structure and origins; (6) build vocabulary from the earliest levels by exposing students to a broad, rich curriculum; and (7) support reading comprehension by focusing on a deep understanding of topic and theme rather than just a set of strategies and gimmicks.

Very few studies, however, have attempted to ascertain whether, and to what the extent, corpus-based findings have achieved such goals. The diverse nature of EAP, and the unique methodological challenges involved in compiling and using corpora, provide sufficient incentive for replication research in this area.

In the present study, we examined &quot;bidirectional&quot; influences of literacy skills in multilingual contexts, and whether the nature of relations varied as a function of literacy instruction environment. To do so, we used longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial of a literacy intervention for children in Grades 1 and 2, learning to read in Kiswahili and English, two official languages in Kenya. Children in the treatment condition received explicit and systematic instruction on literacy (e.g., phonological awareness, phoneme-grapheme correspondences) in Kiswahili and English, whereas children in the control condition did not. Overall results supported bidirectionality of relations, such that children's literacy skills in the two languages were reciprocally related over time. However, directionality of relations differed as a function of language and literacy instruction condition, such that the relation from English to Kiswahili was found across intervention conditions, but the relation from Kiswahili to English was found only among children who had received explicit instruction in Kiswahili reading.

The achievement of Hispanic students needs to improve dramatically over the next five years and this book describes the cornerstone elements for bringing about this change. The initial chapter introduces direct instruction to be used with reading and literacy programs. Chapters 2 and 3 provide excellent review of the literature in language development and address developing language instruction, listening, and speaking with Spanish-speaking students and offers what a comprehensive language development program should look like. Chapter 4 reviews academic language and literacy instruction while the next addresses the components of instruction in Spanish. Chapter 6 offers lesson plan suggestions for Spanish-speaking students, while the following two sections discuss components that transfer and do not transfer in Spanish to English reading instruction. Chapter 9 reviews English language development and provides lesson plans for implementing SDAIE programs. Finally, Chapter 10 discusses two-way bilingual immersion and shares actual classroom schedules and lessons. This unique text will help in the preparation of primary grade teachers throughout the U.S. so that they may be successful with Hispanic students entering the public schools with little or no English background.

As a semantic/pragmatic category, definiteness is notoriously slippery to define -- is it uniqueness, familiarity, inclusiveness or identifiability? Literature has shown that the lack of an agreed definition can complicate any principled attempt to explain the meanings that are encoded by (in)definiteness markers such as articles. This paper considers pragmatic meanings that might arise if definiteness is seen as a semantic composite of locatability, inclusiveness and exclusivity (Chesterman, 2005). Such meanings may be able to account for variation patterns found in outer circle varieties. Speakers of these varieties may therefore construct a semantic/pragmatic system of articles that differs slightly from that of inner circle varieties but can be assumed to express systematic meanings that are achieved through communicative cooperation and implicature &quot;a la&quot; Grice.

The pedagogical framework, Systematic-Theoretical Instruction (STI), adopted in this study was proposed by Piotr Gal&apos;perin and originated from Vygotsky&apos;s sociocultural theory (SCT) of consciousness. The foundational principle of STI is that well-organized education can promote mental development if it provides learners with appropriate mediation in the form of concrete cognitive tools and step-by-step guidance. Given its complexity the Chinese temporal-system was chosen as the unit of instruction. The figurative meaning and grammatical functions of Chinese temporal expressions and selected aspect markers (zhe, le, and le...le) were presented in the form of visual schemata (SCOBAs) as a means for learners to regulate their mental actions during the learning process. The concept-based instruction not only provided learners with the meaning of the target grammatical unit, but also provided step-by-step guidance for learners to develop the target grammatical concept. The teaching experiment spanned eight weeks. Statistical analyses of performance on written tasks (translation and essay) by three different groups of CFL learners were conducted. The experimental group and control group 1 were at the elementary level and were taught by the researcher of the present study. Control group 2 was at the intermediate level and taught by other instructors. Analyses revealed that the experimental group outperformed control group 1 and performed no differently (no statistical difference) from the more advanced control group 2. Qualitative analyses were also carried out on the tasks completed by the experimental group. A questionnaire was also administered to the experimental group at the end of the instructional period in order to investigate learners&apos; response to the innovative teaching approach and their learning progress. Qualitative analyses indicated that as the instructional program progressed, participants exhibited improvement in terms of efficiency, correctness and consistency of performance on the relevant tasks. The findings suggest that a coherent and organized pedagogical presentation can enhance learners&apos; development. In addition, complicated grammatical concepts regarded more suitable for advanced learners can be taught to novice learners when the concepts are presented as meaningful units in a coherent and systematic way. This study also offers implications on current foreign language pedagogical practices, especially in the field of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, in terms of renovation of grammar instruction, development of teaching material, curriculum design and learner development.

W., Pradhan, Sunam, Dalgarno, Barney", "description": "Modern information technology and computer science curricula employ a variety of graphical tools and development environments to facilitate student learning of introductory programming concepts and techniques. While the provision of interactive features and the use of visualization can enhance students' understanding and assist them in grasping fundamental ideas, the real difficulty for many students lies in making the transition from relying on the graphical features of these tools, to actually writing programming code statements in accordance with a set of plain English instructions. This article opens with a systematic review of the literature on alternative approaches to teaching object-oriented programming (OOP) to novice programmers. It then describes the rationale behind an &quot;objects first, class user first&quot; approach to introducing OOP, arguing for the use of interactive GUI-based visualization tools such as BlueJ as cognitive tools to allow learners to represent and manipulate their mental models or schemas. Finally, it reports on a study involving a cohort of students undertaking an introductory OOP unit in Java. The study investigated the effectiveness of: (i) the graphical features of BlueJ as a cognitive tool while performing coding tasks as part of a test; and (ii) the use of screencasts (video screen captures) of BlueJ to provide scaffolding during learning, which involves the provision of temporary support structures to assist learners in attaining the next stage or level in their development. The screencasts were used in conjunction with a series of structured exercises by providing an intermediate stepping stone to ease the transition to the writing of program code. The study found no significant effect of screencasts during the learning phase of the study, and no significant effect of BlueJ during testing. This result runs counter to theoretical predictions and consequently is important both for researchers focusing on the pedagogy associated with learning programming as well as those interested in the broader applications of animated instructional resources and cognitive tools. In the article, the authors postulate a number of reasons for the lack of significant effects to support their hypotheses. Firstly, it is possible that some, or perhaps many, participants who had access to BlueJ during the testing phase did not actually use it to assist them in answering the test questions. Secondly, since the screencasts and BlueJ were intended to ease students' transition to code, the data collection was conducted immediately following the participants' initial exposure to code statements. This gave rise to the possibility that they may not have been ready to attempt the questions framed at a high level of abstraction, which accounted for a majority of the test marks. The authors had hypothesized that the most benefit in providing the screencast-based scaffolding and the use of BlueJ as a cognitive tool was likely to be gained in assisting students with writing code for English instructions at this high level of abstraction; however, at this point in the semester they may not have been adequately prepared to undertake these types of questions, which required them to interpret the high-level task requirements and decompose them into individual object and class operations that would achieve the desired outcome (object state). Further research will need to be carried out to determine whether these hypothesized reasons for the lack of an identifiable difference between conditions can be supported, whether other factors are responsible, or whether in fact neither BlueJ screencasts nor the use of BlueJ as a cognitive tool actually enhance learning. One possible approach to a follow-up study would involve using a smaller number of students, but carrying out intensive observation during the experiment in order  to determine the degree to which, and ways in which, BlueJ is used. This may include an oral component incorporating think-aloud protocols (Ericson &amp; Simon, 1993) and/or follow-up interviews to gain deeper insight into and understanding of the participants' thought processes as they attempt the various questions in the test, as well as to identify gaps in their understanding in relation to the test questions. In addition to informing on the value of screencasts and cognitive tools for the learning of programming, such a study would also reveal in greater depth the nature of the cognitive stages involved in learning to write object-oriented program code from English instructions.

This is known as the Simple View of Reading. To read words accurately and fluently, students need strategies to read words they have never seen before in print as well as words they have previously encountered. To understand the meaning of texts, students must have sufficient language comprehension skills. Reading involves a complex integration of skills. Proficient readers seem to make the process look effortless, but reading instruction for all students requires systematic instruction in both word reading and comprehension. For students in the early stages of reading, or for those who struggle, reading is particularly difficult and requires careful instruction and intervention.

Verbal IQ and motivation seem  to be the most important factors in predicting success in learning a foreign language. While the new methods of teaching languages do not show the advantages often claimed, they are no worse than the old methods; however, some research supports the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking pupils are better able to learn when they use their native language and have systematic instruction in English as a second language.

However, these systems also merit investigation in their own right through their implications for general linguistic theory. Experimental and informal observation of the contrastive approach in its present form reveal serious limitations, in part because learner behavior cannot be exhaustively described without reference to the AL. Theoretical and practical  considerations therefore converge to suggest the direct and systematic examination of such learner speech, viewed within the general framework of the current theory. Such investigation would (1) provide attested information, of immediate utility in teaching and course development, on patterns of learning behavior for the principal structures of the target languages; (2) permit further assessment of the current suppositions of contrastive analysis; and (3) make possible a preliminary description of AL, thus progressing toward a reformulated contrastive approach.

Suggestions for managing the national system and overcoming  inadequacies, including lateral and vertical discontinuities and western European bias, are offered. It is concluded that for a more foreign language-competent society, systematic national planning and development must occur. Common standards must be set, strategies for matching individual needs to appropriate training have to be established, and subsystems must be coordinated and articulated. Above all, direct national attention must be paid to raising the occupational demand for and use of languages, and the level of skills taught and acquired should be raised.

He comes to the text with certain expectations and uses a cyclical process of sampling, predicting, testing, and confirming to understand it. The overall goal of reading instruction is to produce motivated, independent, fluent, and efficient readers. Researchers and teachers have devised a number of teaching strategies and exercises to promote good reading skills and lead to reading comprehension. They have particularly emphasized the strategy of contextual guessing using typographical, pictorial, syntactic, and semantic clues. Not all students are equally successful at learning new words, but use a variety of strategies based on individual preferences and  learning styles. Research strongly suggests that knowledge of vocabulary and reading comprehension are positively correlated and that the systematic development of word identification skills will improve reading. However, fluent reading will only be accomplished through adequate, continuous practice.

First, a lexical framework that offers a series of questions to help teachers discover the relevant semantic and pragmatic information associated with grammatical structures is discussed. This framework assures a more systematic approach to what otherwise seems to be an infinite range of information. It is then argued that a consideration of the semantic and pragmatic generalizations and principles associated with grammatical structure is consistent with the major goals and assumptions of GCR. Activities for building lexical knowledge about grammatical structures that correspond with GCR activities  are described, including judgment and discrimination exercises, such as drawing inferences, paraphrasing, creating context, and judging appropriateness. It is suggested that the vastness of information networks in a lexical framework necessitates teaching students various strategies that encourage schema building, associational thinking, and inferencing.

The study used a descriptive study design, with a selected sample of 300 male and female English language teachers from elementary and middle schools. The research conducted a group-wide comparison using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings illustrate that educational qualification, career status, job experience and training courses substantially affect application of the SIOP model in the classroom. Results also show that technical, financial capabilities and teachers' qualifications enable the SIOP implementation in the Saudi classroom. The study suggests the implementation of the SIOP model for the sake of transitioning from the traditional English language education system to more advanced methods concerned with the systematic evaluation of English language teachers and classroom environment standards.

An introduction discusses general principles for teaching reading to students with disabilities and emphasizes the importance of individually designing a program based on a student's strengths and needs, parent involvement, and academic modifications. The following information is organized into seven chapters, each of which describes essential skill building and teaching activities: (1) phonological awareness; (2) systematic phonics instruction; (3) word identification; (4) supported passage reading; (5) fluent reading; (6) reading comprehension; and (7) early intervention in reading. The chapters are organized into the  following sections: what it is, why it is important, what parents can do, what teachers can do, information for second language learners, and references. Methods of teaching reading to students with disabilities described in the booklet have been shown to be particularly effective. Some of these methods are used in regular education classrooms for students who are just learning to read, but they are appropriate and useful for students with disabilities of any age who have not learned to read well.

Aaron, the subject of the case study, was a second-grade African-American student who could neither read nor write at the beginning of the study. At the start of the school year, the teacher incorporated a program for systematic, whole-class phonics/spelling instruction. She insisted that the children take responsibility for their own learning, for sharing their knowledge with others in cooperative tasks, for resolving conflicts, and for organizing and helping her run the classroom. Still, Aaron's &quot;voice&quot; could  not be heard in the classroom. As a result of discussion with peers, the teacher included supplemental systematic instruction in linguistic analyses and phonemic awareness, in groups small enough to command teacher attention to individual children. At the end of the year, Aaron was promoted to the third grade, saw himself as successful, was anxious to tackle new material, felt his depression lifted, experienced less conflictive situations with his peers, and was able to read and write full, large letters and stories. Findings suggest that, regardless of socialized norms, the ethics of teaching require providing all children with the means of accessing literature independently.

Despite the diversity in the way texts (content) are encoded, they may be traced to the contexts in which they communicate meaning, indicating a form-function relationship. Language students need to study the features of context more closely and be made aware of the available wording options for encoding the text-context relationship. The systemic-functional model of language offers a means of organizing the many uses of language in a systematic manner and of showing how we use language to express meaning. It isolates the features of meaning in a context (field, mode, tenor, and purpose) and the kinds  of meaning in wording (textual, interpersonal, and ideational). This allows teachers to understand better how text relates to context and helps them determine what to include in a communicative syllabus.

Parallel to the development of discourse analysis, traditional language learning and teaching philosophies and methodologies have been supplemented or replaced by functional approaches, focusing on developing communicative competence, beyond strictly grammatical abilities. In the context of this relatively recent emphasis, intonation emerges as a fundamental component of the communicative process. The communicative value of a sentence cannot be determined from isolated utterances; the interpretation of its value is dependent on the interactive function of the utterance within the given discourse. Intonation is used to signal such discursal information as the speaker's awareness of knowledge shared  with the listener. Integrating intonation into language instruction requires first examining the types of classroom discourse. Student and teacher utterances are restricted to certain types, and although students hear grammatically correct utterances, there is little genuine discourse with appropriate intonational patterns. The first priority in restructuring curricula to facilitate acquisition of interactive skills and intonational competence is to devise discourse situations accurately reflecting real or natural communication. Intonation should be treated not as a function of attitude or grammar but of discourse by providing systematic contrastive uses of intonation in various types of discourse situations that can be practiced, with tape recordings or computerized illustration.

In an effort to improve learners' writing accuracy, I adopted WL, whereby upon receiving online direct corrections, learners typed their self-explanations regarding the underlying reasons for their writing mistakes. Then, I engaged in systematic reflection and journaling during a 10-week semester to critically analyze the affordances and limitations of WL. The conclusion, drawn from my perceptions of the usefulness of WL originating from my journal writing, is that WL has the potential to not only facilitate learning for students but also can provide teachers with a rich description of learners' cognitive and affective engagement with CF.

Although public officials advised immigrants to use American English rather than their mother tongues, no legislation was enacted mandating English as the official language of education. However, with sizeable groups of immigrants arriving in the late 1800s, political issues and xenophobia brought about federal legislation and legislation in 32 states mandating English as the only language of instruction. By 1920 and until the 1960s, testing in English was used for screening people for employment and voting. Based on public laws of the last 20 years and results of court litigation, it appears educators must be careful to avoid systematic exclusion of culturally  and/or linguistically different students from the learning experience due to either their inability to understand the language of instruction or the teacher's inability to appreciate their speech community. Although no student has a constitutional right to a specific educational experience, each is protected from denial of access to education because of language barriers.

This gap is aggravated by the fact that the terminology proposed in the literature to analyse teachers' textbook use is characterised by inconsistencies because different terms denote the same adaptation techniques, identical terms refer to different techniques and suggested frameworks differ in the fact that comparable techniques are allocated to different categories. This inconsistency mirrors the difficulty of operationally defining adaptation techniques, as the terms used may be unambiguous but vague and therefore of reduced explanatory power or more specific but potentially unreliable because an adaptation may be matched to different terms given the complexity of a particular textbook adaptation. Discussing these aspects, this paper proposes a research-informed framework to contribute to a systematic description of textbook adaptation in foreign and second language teaching. Examining adaptation as a process, it is argued that teachers, driven by an identified or felt mismatch between the textbook and other factors (e.g., school facilities, the learners, teacher cognition, course requirements, or outdatedness of the materials), engage in adaptation based on principles (i.e., ideas about best practices, by making changes to the content, the language and/or the sequence of activities offered by the textbook authors).

The research investigates what attitudes English teachers in Turkey and Georgia have towards the teaching of proverbs in foreign language classrooms and their knowledge of proverbs in general. The research hypothesis is the following: &quot;Foreign language teachers underestimate the significant role of proverbs in forming intercultural competence in foreign language acquisition; however, designing creative materials will encourage teachers to teach proverbs in foreign language classes.&quot; The goal of the research is to raise the teachers' awareness of the teaching of proverbs and has suggestions for foreign language teachers to promote the value of proverbs in their second language teaching classes. Our study of proverbs was developed to investigate three specific areas: 1. &quot;Semantic approach to proverbs about children in English, Georgian and Turkish languages.&quot; 2. &quot;English Teachers' attitudes towards learning and teaching proverbs.&quot; 3. &quot;Developing Foreign Language Skills and Intercultural Awareness of Young Students by Teaching Proverbs in English, Georgian and Turkish Languages.&quot; The novelty and theoretical value of the research is that it is the first systematic study of the proverbs in three languages (English, Turkish and Georgian) in the areas outlined above.Proverbs improve intercultural awareness among students; thus foreign language teachers are expected to be inspired by the results of this research. The Methods used in the study are comparative (proverbs from three nations, English, Georgian, and Turkish) and contrastive methods of identification (teachers of English from Georgia and Turkey); descriptive methods; collection of primary data; statistical/quantitative (the Survey), and qualitative (in-depth interview analysis) methods. 177 English language teachers from Georgia and Turkey participated in the Survey.

Initial instruction required somewhat artificial stimulus-response relationships to compensate for the lack of responsiveness to social consequences that characterizes autism. However, as in other studies in which conversational language was successfully taught to children with autism, systematic fading procedures facilitated transfer of stimulus control from the contrived cues needed to teach a child with autism to say age-appropriate social phrases to conditions that call for comments and queries in everyday situations.

Three major categories of problems that may inhibit the learning of reading and language skills are identified: physical (both aural and visual), environmental experience, and inadequate teaching.

Depending on the individual learners, learning and teaching contexts and modes of delivery, teaching materials and approaches will be different.

These topics have also received the attention of FLT scholars in China, which, with its vast educational system and increasing involvement on the international stage, has the potential to provide an instructive contribution to the debate. The Chinese literature is, however, largely unknown outside the Mandarin-speaking world. We therefore conducted an extensive survey of the relevant literature in China, from its inception in 1980 through 2014. Our aim is to provide a relatively comprehensive overview of the main themes and research perspectives, and the development and current state of culture teaching and intercultural communication studies in that country. This paper presents the main findings of that survey, against the background of the history of Chinese EFL syllabi. The survey indicates that culture is principally perceived from an anthropological or sociological perspective as the way of life. Culture learning is predominantly viewed as static knowledge of products, practices and perspectives rather than a dynamic process of meaning making. There has been a gradual transition in pedagogical theory and practice from the transmission of knowledge about culture and cultures to the development of intercultural communicative competence. Some innovative and empirically based ideas have been proposed, but our findings suggest that the question of culture teaching in FLT has not yet been explored in a thorough-going and systematic manner.", "subject": "Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Cultural Awareness, English (Second Language), Course Descriptions, Intercultural Communication, Foreign Countries, Educational History, Communicative Competence (Languages), Teaching Methods, Educational Theories", "source": "Intercultural Education", "publicationdateyear": 2019.0}, {"title": "Field Test Report of the Self-Directed, Interpretive, and Creative Reading Elements of the Wisconsin Design for Reading Skill Development.

This study investigated the language biographies of plurilingual and monolingual teachers of ESL in Australia and found them to be characterised by a wide range of circumstantial and elective language learning experiences. The effect of different experiences on teachers' knowledge and beliefs about language learning and teaching are presented and discussed, drawing upon literature from language teacher cognition. Plurilingual teachers were found to see language learning as challenging but possible, whereas monolingual teachers associated language learning with their own unsuccessful experiences and saw it as difficult and potentially humiliating. Circumstantial plurilinguals were found to have a wide range of language experiences which contribute to their understanding of familial language use and issues arising from child and adult migration.

AHP is a measurement procedure wherein pairwise comparisons are made at different levels, each of which comprises a specific criterion. A series of hierarchical comparisons are consecutively carried out to help the evaluator prioritize the available alternatives, that is, the materials or coursebooks to be chosen. This procedure can be used by both individuals and teams and can be utilized in various decision-making settings, as was done by British Airways, which applied the method in choosing the best entertainment system for its flights in 1998. Numerous evaluation criteria have been proposed to help teachers assess materials more validly and reliably, using checklists with several categories or components, such as syllabus, content, illustrations, and price, to facilitate the evaluation process.

Although most children will eventually become competent, indeed skilled, readers of their languages, the pre-reading (e.g. phonological awareness) and language skills that they bring to school may differ in systematic ways for different language environments. A thorough understanding of potential differences is required if literacy teaching is to be optimized in different languages. Here we propose a theoretical framework based on a psycholinguistic grain size approach to guide the collection of evidence in different countries. We argue that the development of reading depends on children's phonological awareness in all languages studied to date.

Through introducing pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic dimensions of requesting, the intervention aimed to develop metapragmatic awareness and foster learner agency by teaching pragmalinguistic resources related to request strategies, raising awareness of contextual considerations, and drawing attention to individual perceptions of appropriateness. The instruction focused on scientific concepts, that is, systematic and abstract objects of study which facilitate learner reflections. This article draws on data collected during group interviews to analyse whether learners used scientific concepts introduced during the instruction--for example, directness of the head act and attention getters--and if so, how these were used to express metapragmatic understandings. The analysis shows how such scientific concepts were internalised and used by learners to express their understandings of the importance of linguistic variation and the communicative functions of requests, as well as compare request strategies in English and Norwegian. Lived experiences, contextual considerations, and prior knowledge were also used as frames of reference for interpreting the appropriateness of requests. Adding to pragmatics research using concept-based approaches with (young) adults (e.g., van Compernolle, 2014), this study reveals that internalising a conceptual understanding of pragmatic phenomena in a foreign language is possible even for young language learners, thus contributing to knowledge about how learners come to understand pragmatic phenomena and how pragmatics can be taught with these age groups.", "subject": "Pragmatics, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Role, Elementary School Students, Intervention, Sociocultural Patterns, Learning Theories, Metalinguistics, Context Effect, Individual Differences, Personal Autonomy, Teaching Methods, Speech Acts, Language Variation, Contrastive Linguistics, Norwegian, Prior Learning, Grade 7, Language Usage, Foreign Countries, Discourse Analysis", "source": "Intercultural Communication Education", "publicationdateyear": 2021.0}, {"title": "Contesting the Monolingual Practices of a Bilingual to Multilingual Policy", "author": "Heugh, Kathleen", "description": "English has always occupied the most privileged position in the South African economy, yet legislative and material provision emphasised bilingual or trilingual education prior to political change in 1994. Educational changes since this time have been accompanied by ambiguous stances towards languages other than English in the classroom. Whilst this is not detrimental to middle-class students, it offers a chimera of access to English as the language of socio-economic goods, but it cannot facilitate epistemological access to the curriculum for 85% of students. Delays in the implementation of multilingual education policy have led to inertia across the system. However, the principal of a poor, inner-city, linguistically diverse school has sought to reinstate the use of the languages best known and used by students in the classroom. They are included in teaching and in extra-curricular activities alongside English. The innovation has been accompanied by significant changes in student positions from initial resistance to linguistically inclusive teaching, to a clarification of language rights and thence to explicit student choice of a bilingual Xhosa-English teaching and learning process. Narratives show, however, the difficulty of ensuring that written texts accompany and support languages used alongside English in the classroom in the absence of system-wide implementation. They signal, therefore, the locus for further systematic support of multilingual classrooms and also the need for longitudinal observation and data-collection for nuanced understandings of shifting positions towards the linguistic ecology, as these affect learning.

The communicative language teaching method has been used for more than two decades in Saudi Arabia and research conducted during this period offers some insight into the main challenges of the implementation. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize findings from research studies conducted in the past and by doing so, suggest the possible avenues for tackling these challenges. Four broad categories of challenges have been adopted from Li's (1998) comprehensive framework in an attempt to structure the challenges under meaningful labels. This, in turn, enabled us to categorize the challenges according to their source which helped our understanding of how to resolve them. The findings suggest that the most frequently observed policy-related challenges are the current exam system, overcrowded classes, no AV equipment, and low quality of in-house training programs for teachers. Teacher-related challenges mostly relate to conflicting ideas about CLT, low confidence in these methods, preference for the traditional learning model, focus on developing skills that feature in the exams, and deficiencies in teachers' English. Student-related challenges are found to be their low-level proficiency, passive learning style, lack of motivation to learn the target language, and fear of their marks being negatively affected if they are paired with weaker peers during communicative activities.

It follows that the adoption of hybrid technology approaches, following universal design principles, can help to integrate access to education and sign language literacy. Design/methodology/approach: The working method used to carry out this work consists of a systematic review of the scientific literature. This is a research project based on the recapitulation of information about sign language in the international panorama and the improvements used for its instruction. For this purpose, the well-known PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) is used to synthesize the search carried out. A systematic review of the articles published in scientific journals about pedagogy in the teaching of sign language in the international field and technological innovation for sign language teaching has been carried out, incorporating different approaches and personal assessments. The first phase of the method consists of identifying and analyzing the articles published in scientific journals on the teaching of sign language on the international scene and the importance of new educational models with the incorporation of various didactic adaptations, evaluating the selected articles over a period of time from 2009 to 2021. Six steps were used in the systematic review study (Figure 1). First, Steps 1-4 were conducted in 2020 and 2021 as part of a doctoral research. A schematic summary of Steps 1-4 is presented below, followed by Steps 5 and 6, added later to the study after completion of Step 4. In the case of the first four steps they were conducted by two researchers: the thesis tutor and the doctoral student, and Steps 5 and 6 were conducted by the Ph. Findings: To carry out the analysis of the results, the codification of the variables was carried out. The selected studies are characterized by their international context with a final selection of 39 studies have found several variables that affect the relationship between the teaching of sign language in the international arena and the use of technological innovations to adapt their teaching to students (Figure 4). In this section we present the technology grouped variables included in each factor and the possibilities of standardization and applicability of sign language teaching in the international panorama. Within these articles, the importance of defining training programs in sign language for teachers and the need to evaluate teaching programs is identified, with a focus on actions to improve school curricula to achieve linguistic standardization and inclusion in the academic environment, as well as their use at all levels of education. Therefore, professional practices and cooperation between institutions such as: associations of families of deaf students and educational institutions must be improved, making it possible to give a quality education. Within the exclusion criteria, the articles that do not use sign language teaching tools (n\u00a0=\u00a045) were subsequently discarded, followed by the articles that do not indicate any intervention in students with disabilities (n\u00a0=\u00a048), concluding with the articles that nonsign language disability education (n\u00a0=\u00a044). Subsequently, among those selected, the technology articles that do not speak about sign language were discarded (n\u00a0=\u00a032), as well as the studies that protect indigenous language but not sign language (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and, to conclude, the linguistic normalization articles but do not cite sign language (n\u00a0=\u00a037). Originality/value: Communication is the element by which the authors can understand each other with the rest of the people around us, in the diversity of language, within non-verbal language, the authors find sign language, the language of deaf and mute people, of families, as a professional employee and nowadays, learned by many non-deaf and mute people to achieve a more inclusive and integrated society with all people. Every country has the right to have its own sign language, especially one that claims its culture and customs, through non-verbal communication with which to express multiple meanings, emotions and intentions. It is essential to know and apply the technological advances that are being developed, promoting the right to autonomy and the defense of the indigenous language as a cultural element of the intangible heritage of each country. The use of technology allows the democratization of culture and access to information regardless of where one lives in the world, in an increasingly globalized society in which communication plays a fundamental role. In the case of the global pandemic, it has forced us to the advancement of home education and the use of efficient digital tools to achieve it such as videoconferencing, in the field of disability there are still many limitations on this use by the various companies that develop them. Within the inclusive educational research the authors must emphasize the need for equality of tools and content for all types of students, especially in sign language.

Students who struggle early with reading have difficulty catching up with their peers as they move through school and in academic areas that rely on reading proficiency. Individuals with disabilities who are unable to effectively and efficiently use oral speech may benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to facilitate early literacy development. AAC includes all of the ways students share their ideas and feelings without speaking. Because individuals with disabilities who use AAC may rely on reading and writing skills for expressive communication, instruction in reading and writing is particularly important. Prior research indicated that, in the past, AAC users were taught to read through memorization of sight words, however relying solely on sight-word instruction put students who used AAC at a disadvantage because they did not develop decoding strategies for approaching new words. When students who use AAC are taught to read, they need to receive systematic instruction in the range of skills that contribute to word-level reading. A great deal of early literacy instruction that leads to word-level decoding relies heavily on oral speech, therefore, teachers may experience unique challenges when designing and implementing interventions to support the acquisition of these skills for students with physical disabilities and complex communication needs (PDCCN) who use AAC. This article discusses techniques and strategies that literacy instruction teachers can use to benefit students with PDCCN who use AAC. Creating meaningful early literacy instruction requires teachers to engage in modified assessment procedures, determine students' response modes, ensure that AAC systems facilitate instruction, and systematically plan for instructional opportunities.

In this article, cooperative learning and systemic functional linguistics are first described. Next, they are used to analyze a transcript of student-student interaction from an elementary school science classroom.

A TL theory of language asserts an activist agenda to dismantle mono/lingualism, inviting a more dynamic and expansive view of multilingualism that actively challenges linguistic hierarchies and associated ideologies to recognize networks of meaning distributed across linguistic and nonlinguistic forms. This openness to all resources beyond language commensurates with the emerging posthumanist and new materialist perspectives in applied linguistics to consider how bodies, objects, and space intersect as wider assemblages, inciting critical citizenship in ethical interdependence between the human and natural world. Grounded in this understanding, we propose a systematic, coherent TL methodology for TESOL and teacher education, engaging teachers and students in critical sociolinguistic inquiry and embodied practice to support interrogation of language and power, mapping inter- and intra-actions in the human, social and eco-environment. With this approach teachers might explore with students' ways of doing/being/knowing in reflexivity towards all forms of inequities, particularly one's privilege and complicity and what ethical responsibility entails in the sociocultural, sociopolitical, and eco-world.

When an American student looks at a foreign word, he may associate it with letters or groups of letters in the American phonic system. After an individual has learned to read (i.e. to associate sounds with symbols), he has difficulty understanding that a letter has a different sound in another language. This becomes evident when a language teacher pronounces a foreign word, and the student displays lack of comprehension until the word is presented to him in visual  form. A concentrated comparative study of the sound-symbol correlatives in both the mother tongue and the target language makes the student aware of the similarities and differences of the sound systems of the two languages. The approach described is a systematic effort to associate the distinctively French sound with the printed letters.

Qualitative analyses revealed that poetry can have a place in language teaching by using a systematic and guided framework tailored to the features of a language classroom. With the help of the proposed framework, implementing poetry in the language class helped to promote motivation, creativity and self-expression along with multi-skill development and interaction among learners. However, incorporating poetry into the language class was challenging in terms of time and effort required and difficulties in material selection and design. This study suggests that poetry can become part of language teacher education. In this regard, this article proposes implications for teachers and teacher educators for the implementation of poetry in language teaching practice.", "subject": "Poetry, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, English (Second Language), Language Teachers, Teaching Methods, Guidelines, Teacher Education Programs, Microteaching, Recall (Psychology), Student Teachers, Student Teacher Attitudes, Student Motivation, Skill Development, Teacher Educators, Foreign Countries, Creativity, Media Selection", "source": "Advances in Language and Literary Studies", "publicationdateyear": 2018.0}, {"title": "New Millennium, New Directions: Dimension 2000.

Previous research has documented that preschool attendance and development of home language skills in early childhood support the long-term academic and linguistic growth of DLLs; yet, relatively, little is known about how early childhood educators support bilingual language development in preschool and how such efforts impact bilingual proficiency. These are particularly salient questions, as emerging best practices to support DLLs identified in research may not be reaching educators with sufficient speed. The present mixed methods study examined the role of instructional and contextual factors in promoting English and Spanish language development among (N = 46) Latinx preschoolers. Qualitative phenomenological analyses were conducted to explore the nature of language instruction practices in Central California preschools. Analysis of covariance was used to determine if classroom characteristics, including culturally and linguistically responsive instruction practices and overall classroom quality, predict English and Spanish language proficiency at the end of the preschool year. Results suggest that language instruction practices may tend to be more reactive than systematic, and support findings that high overall instructional quality and application of targeted instructional supports for bilingual acquisition support the development of home language skills throughout the school year. The results reinforce the call for increased attention to bilingual language development in early childhood settings, especially through assessment, instruction models, and multi-tiered systems of support. School psychologists, who are trained on these topics, have a significant opportunity to collaborate with early childhood administrators and teachers to educate themselves further on DLLs' early language development needs, help improve culturally and linguistically responsive instruction and assessment in early learning settings, and work to bridge the early childhood and K-12 systems to support DLLs' ongoing development.", "subject": "Spanish, Second Language Learning, Preschool Children, English (Second Language), Hispanic American Students, Bilingualism, Language Proficiency, Phenomenology, Achievement Gap, Preschool Education, Native Language Instruction, Native Language, Context Effect, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Culturally Relevant Education, Educational Quality, Prediction, School Psychologists, Counselor Teacher Cooperation, Student Evaluation, Evaluation Methods, Administrators", "source": "Contemporary School Psychology", "publicationdateyear": 2019.0}, {"title": "Explaining Motivation in Language Learning: A Framework for Evaluation and Research", "author": "Bower, Kim", "description": "Researching motivation in language learning is complex and multi-faceted.

(2) What are the main elements of CLIL that enhance motivation? Overall analysis of the results found that where expectations of success were high and where the teaching was effective, CLIL had a positive impact on motivation and progress.

The theoretical framework of this study was basically the importance of teaching media literacy. It considered that the way a teacher views the role of media in classroom teaching will, to a large extent, determine the level and degree of its usage. The theoretical framework entailed a discussion of the Puerto Rico Department of Education's English Program, 21st century skills, media literacy, critical pedagogy, and teacher professional development.

The country has moved from long term-practiced Grammar Translation Method to Communicative Language Teaching Method for teaching second language, particularly English. But, efforts in the teaching of English language seem relatively lacking and not sufficient while considering the demand of time and motion going on throughout the world. With an extreme urge for the diversity in ELT in Bangladesh, the study will evaluate the real practices of CLT; roles and performances of teachers, and learners in CLT classroom. The current study has therefore been aimed to verify how far those claims of communicative textbook are successful, why the learners still lack in communication in English, what the obstacles are and finally how to remove those barriers. The present study, become a significant one as a systematic step in this case. And it is greatly expected that the proposed research will result useful solutions for the teachers and students to solve the problems in terms of English language teaching and learning by CLT not only in Bangladesh but also in other non-English countries. Language learning can never happen absolutely unless four basic skills are equally emphasized. Schools therefore arrange listening practices with the help of English video games, documentaries, movies etc. Bengali language should be for bidden for the teachers of English as well as for English classes.

The current study examined effects of a year-long mentoring program to improve teachers' knowledge and effectiveness in teaching phonics and the extent that it improved students' achievement in reading and spelling. Teachers in urban, lower SES schools completed a 45\u00a0h course followed by 90\u00a0h of in-school training. Mentors (N\u00a0=\u00a029) worked with kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade teachers (N\u00a0=\u00a069) twice a week for 30\u00a0weeks during the year.

Mentors taught teachers how to provide systematic phonics instruction to their students (N\u00a0=\u00a01,336). Monthly ratings by mentors revealed that teachers improved their phonics teaching skills with many reaching the highest ratings by May. Teachers who were non-native speakers of English took a bit longer to learn the English sound system for letters, mainly because they lacked sufficient knowledge of English sounds and had to learn them. Given the increasing diversity of the teacher work force, future research is needed to study this difficulty, its solution, and impact on students. Teachers' agreement with principles of phonics instruction remained strong or increased from fall to spring. Students' reading and spelling skills showed large gains during the year and far exceeded effect sizes from comparable data sources. Students met grade-level expectations at the end of kindergarten and first grade but fell short in second and third grades. General education students outperformed bilingual/ELL and special needs students although all subgroups made large gains.

A fundamental problem in contrasting the sound structure of two languages is the question of equivalence between the two sound systems. There are four possible criteria: (1) similar spelling; (2) similar phonetic description and transcription; (3) use of phonological criteria; and (4) perceptual similarity. K. Wiik's phonetic contrasting and substitution tests involve an acoustic comparison of physical phones combined with a systematic approach to their phonological relationships, and can be used to detect interference between units which could hardly be equated on the basis of phonological structures. Because of differing learning strategies and the hierarchy of errors associated with interference, results  of contrastive phonetics cannot be considered final. And finally, the relationship of contrastive phonetics to language teaching problems must be viewed in the light of the fact that, while contrastive phonetics involves a kind of error analysis, \"errors\" as such are not the object of study in this kind of analysis. Rather, it seeks to determine how native speakers react to various kinds of deviations from phonetic habits of their own. Therefore, the criteria used by language teachers to evaluate pronunciation are different from those used by contrastive phonetic analysis.

The more promising type of grammar is one that goes beyond the reference function and facilitates in a systematic and explicit way the learning of the target language. Textbook designers should abandon the \"parasitic\" approach which merely simplifies one or more theoretical linguistic description, as does the \"orthodox\" approach, which follows one linguistic theory only. Naive eclecticism is, however, no solution. The designer  should devise and adapt descriptions according to psychological and sociolinguistic principles. As a starting point, the approach of David Ausubel seems highly appropriate.

The stories can be used to teach story frame and improve semantic, syntactic, and comprehension skills. Applied seatwork can be assigned which strengthens the individual's skills in those areas.

The extent of these relationships is such that four national associations drafted a joint paper stating that oral language competency is the basis for success in reading, and students with an adequate facility in spoken language are less likely to suffer reading and writing difficulties. A Right to Read pamphlet states that reading and talking are interrelated skills: enhancement of one contributes to the development of the other. Unfortunately, the pamphlet also suggests that by school age, children have acquired the fundamentals of language and that their sounds system is completely  matured. Such an assumption ignores the facts that communication behavior is dynamic, that oral communication abilities develop differently in individuals, and that the effective development and use of each of the language skills is dependent upon continued, systematic, and focused instruction in each. Successful instruction in both oral communication and reading will (1) differentiate between basic skills and minimal competencies, (2) focus on processes rather than products, (3) provide explicit communication experiences, (4) provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of the strategies employed in communicating/ reading, and (5) share in the joy of using language.

The targeted population consisted of first grade elementary students in a growing middle class community located in a suburb of a large metropolitan area in the Midwest. The problems of beginning readers not using strategies to help them become independent readers was documented with test scores, student surveys, student writing samples, teacher observations, and pre and post inventory tests. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students who do not coordinate multiple strategies to improve their understanding and memory of text do not become strong readers. Also, a child's ability to profit from opportunities to learn to  read and spell is based on a foundation of language skills built during preschool years. During the past decade, systematic and explicit instruction designed to help students acquire this foundation has not been commonplace. Further data reveals that although the term \"phonemic awareness\" is a rather new one to reading educators, teachers who work with primary grade children have seen children with difficulties in this area for a long time. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others resulted in the development of a series of measurements to identify students who do not use beginning reading strategies. Some of the strategies include: knowledge of letters and their sounds, concepts of print, and phonemic awareness. Post intervention data indicated an increase in  student use of beginning reading strategies which helped them become independent readers. (Contains 18 references.)

Educators need to become more aware of the special problems that even the most motivated ESL students face when learning a language that is as difficult to learn as is English. Whereas many ESL programs have been predicated on the notion that students must be orally proficient before they can read English, research shows that reading and speaking can be taught concurrently. To facilitate  the teaching of reading and writing in the ESL classroom, educators should provide early and systematic instruction in areas such as phonetic spelling, writing mechanics, structural analysis, study skills, and test taking. In addition, planners of ESL and literacy programs should devote more effort to pooling the resources of smaller local programs to avoid duplication, solicit cooperation from and work together with business and industry, offer counseling services, and provide necessary staff development activities.

The goals are stated in such a way that they apply to a variety of second languages. Specifically, the goal statements are grouped under the following headings: (1) values and second language, (2) basic education and second language, (3) the function of the language in society, (4) nature of the language, (5) listening, (6) speaking, (7) reading, (8) writing, (9) culture, and (10) careers and second language. It  is hoped that school systems will use the collection: (1) to clarify the purposes of education for students, teachers, parents and community; (2) to provide a basis for teaching-learning evaluation and accountability; (3) to aid in the rewriting and development of courses and curricula; and (4) for long-range planning and systematic control of educational development.

The study is a partially mixed sequential equal status design. While convenient sampling method was employed to select students, criterion sampling method was utilized to select teachers and supervisors as participants. As a result, 25 ATS students, two vocational course teachers, two English teachers and three supervisors contributed to this research. A survey, semi-structured interview forms and open ended questions in the open interview were employed respectively to collect data from students, teachers and supervisors. In the analysis of the survey data both qualitative and quantitative methods were put into effect. On the other hand, the interview data were analysed through systematic content analysis, inductive coding and thematizing. The result of the analysis of the data revealed that students in this specific context were in need of improving particularly their speaking and listening skills. Low self-confidence of students, negative attitude toward speaking the language, lack of use of appropriate materials; strategies and methods during instruction emerged as issues of consideration in order to reach a resolution.

It is noted that the problems may have little to do with difficulties in processing mathematical ideas. When LEP students are from different cultures, speak languages other than English as their primary language, and have preferred differences in cognitive processing, the typical approach to organized mathematics instruction observed in current American classrooms is not appropriate. The fact that a language deficit will automatically lead to a mathematics deficit is acknowledged. Research conducted with American Indians, including reservation Crow, is cited that identified three  areas in which those students have difficulty in learning mathematics: language, culture, and learning modality. For example, in the beginning grades, mastery of concepts in the Crow language could not be used to facilitate the learning of the same concepts in the English language, because the concepts were not developed in the native language. In addition, the problem was exacerbated by students seeing little or no use for mathematics learned in school and by being presented with instruction that includes few manipulatives and visuals. Further research should focus on determining how familiar situations and tactile and visual approaches, integrated with systematic language activities, can be used to help students improve their performance.

Salient points of research are summarized as follows: (1) if rates of developing understanding vary with the student and with the connective, (2) if gains in understanding continue beyond age 12, (3) if types of errors reflect varying levels of understanding, and (4) if understanding connectives is important to reading comprehension, it follows that systematic instruction in context clues, structure words, and other aspects of syntactic relationships should yield increases in reading comprehension scores, regardless of the  measures used. A scheme of eight types of context clues is then established, followed by various techniques to translate theory into practice. On the premise that context determines meaning, the paper next shows how an efficient means of transferring learning would be to develop new retrieval systems for the information the student already has. The paper views using context clues as hypothesis-testing and argues that the global communication skills are teachable and learnable through direct instruction by the cloze technique in any content area classroom.

By combining strategies and techniques that recognize the second language difficulties that Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CLD) students face, many ESL specialists have implemented it in the United States with successful academic improvements. At the same time, in Japan, English language learners (ELL) in universities have continued to struggle with academic English achievement, which has prompted the Ministry of Education (MEXT) to set higher standards to prepare learners for global careers. However, this has not been sufficient, as Japan ranks 155th among 166 countries on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). There is a clear need for a more effective language teaching approach. Since the SIOP model is a research-based instructional model, the model may be beneficial to other struggling learners in different contexts, including Japan. In addition, there has not been enough empirical evidence generated to determine if the SIOP model is effective in other countries. In this qualitative action research, the effectiveness of the SIOP model within a Japanese context was studied by examining five ELL teachers' perceptions and receptiveness to the model. The qualitative data collected from the interview were analyzed, and results showed that the model was effective in a Japanese university context; these results may assist English teachers in Japanese universities to determine what to teach (e.g. the pairing of linguistic and content targets) by offering systematic teaching techniques and procedures.

As a consequence, we can only understand many processes that drive geological phenomena through analogical reasoning. Building deep conceptual understanding requires instruction that activates the appropriate source analogs and allows students to build useful conceptual metaphors. In this paper we illustrate, using plate tectonics as an example, how educational guidelines for teaching geosciences can be developed by linking the Model of Educational Reconstruction with Conceptual Metaphor Theory. Qualitative content analysis in combination with systematic metaphor analysis of scientific textbooks and semi-structured interviews conducted with students (n = 36) provided insight into the image schemas used by scientists and learners. Difficulties in understanding plate tectonics structures and processes, e.g. subduction, arise because many students understand tectonic plates as single bodies, rather than composites. Similarly, students' difficulties explaining plate movement result from activation of a push rather than a pull schema. Through exploring schemas for plate tectonics, we illustrate the value of combining Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the Model of Educational Reconstruction for (1) understanding alternative conceptions as grounded in image schemas and (2) developing educational guidelines for improving instruction.", "subject": "Plate Tectonics, Science Instruction, Figurative Language, Content Analysis, Scientific Concepts, Concept Formation, Linguistic Theory, Schemata (Cognition), Teaching Methods, Thinking Skills, Models, Student Attitudes, Textbooks, Difficulty Level, Instructional Improvement, Secondary School Students, Cross Cultural Studies, Foreign Countries", "source": "Journal of Geoscience Education", "publicationdateyear": 2022.0}, {"title": "Uncommonly Successful English/Language Arts Programs Share Common Instructional Features", "author": null, "description": "This research brief is published at the mid-way point of a five-year study that is analyzing a spectrum of programs in four states to identify outstanding English instruction in secondary schools.

Recommended is the following in phonics instruction: use phonics instruction as needed to assist a student to identify the unknown word; use a more systematic approach if a learner can benefit from phonics to recognize unknown words; use phonics in an informal way to make these learnings enjoyable; use phonics as a functional approach in recognizing unknown words and not phonics for its own sake; and use work book pages in phonics if they serve a useful purpose.

Heavy phonics instruction may also be a tool for reinforcing and perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities. Heavy phonics instruction reflects the assumptions of a transmission model of education, and the hidden curriculum inherent in that model. While members of the political &quot;far right&quot; may not be aware of the typical effects of promoting a heavy emphasis on phonics, such instruction can be a weapon to further oppress  those already less advantaged. A vastly disproportionate number of non-mainstream students are assigned to lower reading groups, where both the manner and the content of instruction contrast significantly with that offered in higher reading groups. The manner of instruction in lower reading groups socializes those students for subordinate roles in school and in society, while the content of instruction (keeping them busy with skills work instead of real reading) tends to prevent these students from learning to read well enough to achieve more rewarding roles. It is more democratic and more effective to help such children develop phonics know-how through the same means as their more advantaged peers: namely, through extensive and joyful experiences with reading, writing, and books.

To date, there has been relatively little attention paid to the essential standards, knowledge, and skills that general education teachers ought to possess in order to provide effective instruction to ELLs placed in their classroom. Drawing from the literature on what English as a second language and bilingual teachers should know, the authors extrapolated foundational knowledge about ELLs that might serve general education teachers that have these students in their classrooms. These include the importance of attending to oral language development, supporting academic language, and encouraging teachers' cultural sensitivity to the backgrounds of their students.

However a review of the literature reveals that there is little research on their actual performance compared to the non-native local English teachers. This comparative case study examines pedagogic practices of native English speaking teachers (NESTs) and non-native English speaking teachers (NNESTs), and the impact of their teaching on English language learning as perceived by secondary students in Korea. The participants for this study were NESTs and NNESTs along with focal students who were each taught simultaneously by two teachers, a NEST and a NNEST. Six students and four teachers (one NEST and one NNEST and three students) participated at two separate middle schools in Korea. The primary data consisted of interviews with the teachers, classroom observations, audio and video-taped classes of the teachers, as well as interviews with the students reflecting how both the NESTs and NNESTs have impacted their English language skills. The major findings of this study were that due to the teacher-centered nature of the NEST's classes, the pressure to succeed on exams and the size of the class, the students were not able to develop critical English skills such as extended responses and general conversational skills. The students did note however, that their understanding of Western culture, as well as their listening skills, greatly improved in the NEST's class. One NNEST predominantly practiced the grammar-translation method geared to enhance students' test performances, while the other NNEST effectively used code-switching, L1 and L2, allowing students to participate in communicative activities. The study in the NNEST classes showed that in one NNEST class students were able to understand fully English grammar points and reading material which were essential to exam preparation. In the other class, while the exam preparation was not as intense, the teacher focused more on helping the students to think and to achieve a greater speaking ability. The results of this study suggests that local contextual factors which affect NESTs' and NNESTs' pedagogical practices must be more closely examined before enforcing the English-only rule. The study also indicates that there is a basic need to fundamentally correct the mismatch between test and pedagogy practice in English education in secondary Korean schools and to provide systematic support for the teachers.

Because there is insufficient information addressing grammatical variability in school children's speech, it is easy for teachers to misinterpret normal social patterns of variation as the product of error or confusion. This article addresses the lacuna in our understanding of grammatical variation in childhood by presenting a case study of variable subject-verb agreement in the speech of children aged between seven and 11. A detailed quantitative analysis of the co-variation between non-standard and standard variants in children's discourse reveals a heterogeneous, but intricately patterned, system. Furthermore, socially motivated patterns of variation remain stable across the age range examined and are unaffected by increasing exposure to formal education. The tenacity of vernacular norms raises a number of important issues pertinent to the teaching and learning of standard spoken English, including the extent to which children can be expected to substitute standard variants for non-standard ones in spontaneous discourse.

The use of minority language as a medium of instruction is viewed as a way to increase attendance rates and strengthen socialization into a national ideology. However, the policies differ for those ethnic minorities with or without a commonly used written script. Among the minorities without a script are the 300,000 strong Dongxiang, an ethnic group with the lowest level of literacy and school access in China. There is virtually no systematic research on the role of language in school access for Chinese minority groups without a written script. In particular, there is a lack of analysis of the Dongxiang (and similar groups without a written script) learning and school discontinuation. This research aimed to identity the major difficulties in school based learning for the Dongxiang speaking children. Specifically, it explores local perspectives on how language and other factors are related to school enrolment and achievement. In order to accomplish this, the research combined a variety of data gathering methods, including survey questionnaires, open ended interviews, in-depth interviews, field visits, observations, and case studies to analyze the difficulties of language transition faced by Dongxiang ethnic minority children. The results reveal that although native language does not directly cause schoolchildren to discontinue their studies, it has an important indirect influence, especially on the girls. The research results also show that Dongxiang ethnic minority schoolchildren in the early years of schooling generally cannot understand their teachers' Chinese teaching, which results in poor school performances, a decline of interest in learning, a frustrated sense of achievement, and a decline in self-respect. Many students drop out as part of a vicious cycle that sees a reproduction of poor conditions for learning.

When small rural schools first enroll children whose first language is not English, there may be no teachers endorsed specifically to meet linguistic needs, and special educators may be called on for advice. Special education teachers have been trained to meet a variety of special needs, and they are accustomed to involving the family in determining the strengths and needs of a student. In seeking to develop methods and strategies that are sound and functional, special educators can encourage the general educators in their school to provide a balanced educational experience that encompasses systematic phonics-based instruction and a print-rich  environment. Vocabulary development is critical to the academic success of English language learners. Various principles and strategies of vocabulary instruction are discussed, including learning from context, teaching word meaning, keyword strategies, and explicit study systems. The valuable resource of peers, whether they know the dominant language of their fellow student or not, can provide a meaningful, interactive, educational experience for all involved.

Because traditional methods of reading instruction have not been successful with the student-inmate, a new approach is necessary. One such approach is Easy Steps to Reading Improvement (ESTRI), a method of teaching decoding skills and vocabulary development ESTRI teaches one systematic approach to word decoding and teaches no exceptions to the rules. It holds that word decoding is not a part of the  reading process itself, since no one reads for the purpose of decoding words. ESTRI capitalizes on the listening abilities of learners and leads them to mastery of the decoding process, an essential adjunct to intelligent and independent reading. Through the use of this approach, inmates can develop the necessary reading skills for successfully meeting the demands placed upon them by society.

Among these approaches, Communicative language Teaching (CLT) of English is a teaching innovation that has had sufficient time to be learned by Asian EFL teachers, endorsed by the government, and implemented with varying degrees of success and resistance in Taiwan (Kuo, 1995; Su, 2002; Wang, 2002). By closely examining the degree of implementation of this teaching approach in Taiwan as well as the challenges and forces at work influencing its implementation, it should be possible to learn more about how the best of Western teaching ideas might be adapted to Asian contexts and to develop a more effective model for teacher preparation. To address this issue, this study was framed with the theory of curriculum implementation and aimed to answer the following three questions: (1) How have Taiwanese EFL Teachers implemented CLT in Taiwan? (2) What factors facilitate or inhibit the implementation of CLT? What effects do these factors have on CLT implementation as enacted? (3) How do Taiwanese adapt CLT in EFL classrooms in Taiwan? What are the underlying constructs of the adaptation process? To answer these research questions, this study applied a systematic random sampling method to recruit 71 English teachers from 20 colleges. Also, mixed methods research was used by surveying these participants, examining course syllabi and course materials, and interviewing 20 of them. The findings reveal that nearly all teachers report in their syllabi using some CLT principles with the vast majority (about 80%) confirming use in the survey and interviews. Those who do not implement CLT or have stopped using it mainly teach low level students in very large classes. Even among these teachers, however, some have succeeded in adapting CLT. These teachers are the ones aware of educational policies, sensitive to students' traditional ways of learning, and willing to differentiate their teaching based upon students' proficiency levels.

Although it is often said that a student should not write what he has not first heard and practiced orally, it might equally well be said that he should not be expected to write grammatical patterns that he has not read, inasmuch as there is a difference in the structures used in speech and writing. One approach to developing control over patterns in writing is through transformational grammar, because it provides (1) a systematic method of constructing sentences; (2) a device for identifying faulty constructions; and (3) an understanding of how structures which seem similar on the surface may be quite different structures with quite different meanings (\"Grading papers/crying babies can be a  nuisance\"). Studies conducted in the combining of simple statements into more complex sentences show that the more mature and skillful the writer, the more he uses transforms, particularly nominal-producing transforms. The author suggests having students first express their ideas in short simple sentences to develop a feeling for the essential elements of a sentence. They may then move on to combining by coordination or subordination with an adverb clause, passive forms, relative and noun clauses, and verbals.

Results found 13,713 lexical items in Hospitality Management, 17,561 in Criminology, 4576 in Tourism, 7167 in Marine Engineering, and 512 in Information Technology. Furthermore, the overall percentage of ESP lexical items fell in Tier 2 (with multiple-meaning while the least was in Tier 3, specifically on context-specific vocabulary. It is the core of vocabulary learning to ensure English language teaching. It is its goal to help learners better understand language, allowing them to understand others as they want to express themselves as well. This applies not only in speaking but also in writing and reading. Wilkins (1972, p. 111-112) stated that without grammar very little understanding can be acquired and without vocabulary there can be no learning at all. Thus, even without good grammar, so long as you equipped with useful words and expression, one can still manage to communicate. Lewis (1993) argued that &quot;lexis is the heart of language&quot; and that it develops a better fluency and expression in English. He also added the significance to the learners of acquiring a more productive vocabulary knowledge, also, their eagerness to develop their own personal vocabulary strategies. Thus, a proposed bridge model program was recommended to highlight the study findings using the lexicons found from the different respective courses.", "subject": "English for Special Purposes, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Vocabulary Development, Content Analysis, Textbook Evaluation, Hospitality Occupations, Tourism, Law Enforcement, Marine Education, Engineering Education, Grammar, Information Technology, Language Fluency, Language Proficiency, College Students, Word Frequency, Foreign Countries, Teaching Methods, Models", "source": "Online Submission", "publicationdateyear": 2022.0}, {"title": "Meeting Students' Needs in Two EAP Programmes in Vietnam and New Zealand: A Comparative Study", "author": "Hoang Oanh, Duong Thi", "description": "Needs analysis is an issue of major concern for courses of English, both for English as a Second Language (ESL) and as a foreign language (EFL).

Twenty-four young adult learners participated in a learning process that promoted their oral skills and vocabulary development. Self-assessment was mainly examined through the analysis of students' learning logs, field notes and artefacts in the form of audio recordings. By contrasting and analysing data sources, and the results obtained from pre- and post-speaking tasks, through a mixed method design approach, it was found that when students self-assess, they are able to acknowledge their learning strengths and drawbacks. This practice enabled students to set learning commitments, use learning strategies that also allow them to raise awareness and take further actions, while self-monitoring them. Consequently, initial improvements in students' oral fluency development were evinced through the implementation of a systematic cycle that applies self-assessment as a formative assessment source. Thus, the students entered a process in which they gradually become more able to self-monitor, judge and react towards their own gains in language and learning.

Some of the sector's best-sellers, such as Oxford University Press's &quot;Headway&quot; series (Soars &amp; Soars), have sold over 70 million copies (Oz\u00f3g, 2018) with OUP's &quot;English File&quot; (Latham-Koenig, Oxenden, &amp; Lambert) selling over a million copies in China alone. Generally speaking, it is taken for granted that commercial publications in the educational sector are based on sound, accepted pedagogical principles. Early language teaching publications (from the 1950s onwards) naturally reflected practices that were thought to promote language learning at that time--such as repetition, drills and sentence-level grammar exercises. As our understanding of language learning developed, this Structural approach gave way to a Communicative one, reflecting the 1970s preoccupation with the importance of communicative competence, influenced by theorists such as Hymes (e.g. 1972) and Halliday (e.g. 1975). This approach remains the predominant one (in the West at least) 50 years later. It represents, remarkably perhaps, the last time that applied linguistics substantially influenced a language teaching approach, or at least, one that had such global reach and enduring influence. Since then, findings from the fields of applied linguistics and second language (L2) acquisition, which should have fed into language learning approaches and hence language coursebooks, have been slow to do so in any systematic or significant way. Where they have, the way in which language learning theory 'translates' into pedagogy in the coursebook and thence classroom, can be questionable. In parallel with this is the problem of the socio-cultural standpoint of teaching materials of an international language such as English, issuing from a particular geographic heartland, viz. England. As with applied linguistics and L2 acquisition research, developments in sociolinguistic, socio-cultural and socio-political theory have been realised in language teaching coursebooks only as a rather superficial multi-cultural gloss. The advent of 'global' coursebooks conceived in the 1990s, with multiple iterations, attempting to capture international appeal, still has not resolved the conundrum that language--and hence language teaching materials, that is, the combination of content and pedagogy--constitute cultural artefacts, imbued with cultural values and ideologies. All in all, as Timmis, Mukundan, and Alkhaldi laconically observe: 'for such commonplace objects, [coursebooks] have aroused a surprising degree of controversy' (2009, p. 11). These then, are the chief areas of contention that I will develop in this article. Opposing these issues, it will be acknowledged that coursebooks remain the default language learning resource, and that teachers and learners world-wide need, want and value them as ready-made language teaching materials.", "subject": "English (Second Language), Language Teachers, Publications, Textbooks, Textbook Content, Global Approach, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning", "source": "Language Teaching", "publicationdateyear": 2022.0}, {"title": "A Teacher-Training Design for a Multicultural Setting.", "author": "Thursby, Ann", "description": "A study investigated the need and appropriate design for an inservice training program for teachers in a multicultural educational program in the Philippines called &quot;Preparing Refugees for Elementary Programs,&quot; or PREP.

The question exists as to what pedagogic developments will best allow the universities to address these challenges. In this paper, the appropriateness of online pedagogy as one response to these challenges is assessed through use of illustrative case-examples and post-course surveys. The potential of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) to implement this pedagogy is examined through a systematic consideration of the requirements for embedding online learning, specifically student and institutional knowledge, culture, and resources. The case examples provide empirical evidence to suggest that online environments are useful in addressing these challenges, largely as a consequence of afforded flexibility in teaching and learning, support of more student-centered learning approaches, and a high degree of student engagement. Opportunity for international collaborative teaching, with associated benefits in curriculum extension, cost-spreading and benchmarking, is also demonstrated. Within HKU, student factors appear to pose no major constraint to such development, but there exist significant inconsistencies in terms of institutional culture, pedagogic knowledge and non-hardware resources. The author concludes that small-scale online developments are viable and the cost of establishing and maintaining these need not be prohibitive. While online learning holds promise for HKU, the University will require internal institutional change to fully realize this potential.

The study was aimed at revealing how Ngugi - an African L2 writer, deployed lexical cohesive devices to achieve cohesion and coherence and how this has contributed to the meaning of his non-fictional essay. The study was guided by the theoretical framework of Halliday's tripartite metafunctions of language: the ideational, the interpersonal and the textual, with closer inclination to the textual metafunction that deals with text creation. Cohesion is understood in this study as a textual strategy deployed in language use to unify sentences into a text (a unified whole), that renders the speech or writing both readable and meaningful. A total of 29 excerpts, selected from relevant sections of the essay were descriptively analysed. Our analysis revealed that Ngugi made effective use of lexical cohesive devices to tie his text together, thereby succeeded in passing his message clearly to his readers. Our findings also showed a preponderant use of reiteration (near synonym) - 13 times, and repetition - 8 times, by the writer, probably to achieve emphasis. Other lexical devices deployed by the writer to achieve various textual and communicative functions include: antonyms 4 times; superordinate/hyponym, 2 times; and complementaries and cohyponym, 1 each, in crafting his essay, in which he tells a real-life story of his people, his culture and his heritage. Ngugi, by his effective use of cohesive devices along paradigmatic and syntagmatic axis, has demonstrated that an African writer can also, through the medium of biographical writing, project, not only his ideology, but also the exultation of his people, his culture and his inheritance by a skillful and near-native use of the English language.

In order to curb these demotivators and maintain high EFL learning motivation levels, four distinctive components influencing their resilience were identified: social support, emotional regulation, a clear learning goal, and tenacity in EFL learning. This study illustrates that emotional regulation, not negative emotions such as anxiety, is crucial, and students' clearly stated short-term learning goal is a crucial component in maintaining high academic resilience. Participants cultivated specific components influencing resilience as they advanced academically.

To teach morphological concepts and their relation to reading, teachers need to have both awareness and knowledge of morphology. In the present study, general and special education teachers' knowledge of morphological concepts are examined. Results indicate that teachers, regardless of type of certification (general vs. special education) or grade level (elementary vs. secondary), have difficulty identifying morphemes in both simple and complex words.

In judging whether students should be required to learn written Standard English, teachers might examine the implications of Standard English as \"edited written English\" and as \"the white ruling class dialect,\" as well as the validity of claims about the need for Standard English in the world of employment. Although it is important for students to be able to read works of literature written in Standard English, the requirement  that they themselves produce Standard English can easily threaten their sense of personhood. The key factor in adult learning of second dialects is motivation, which implies that students must decide for themselves whether the they want to learn Standard English. Students need to develop knowledge about the use of different dialects in different situations; therefore, teachers should teach all students about the systematic differences between standard and other dialects.

The AMAOs are: 1) Making Progress in English, 2) Attaining English Proficiency, and 3) Meeting Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Until this case study was completed, no review had been done within a New Mexico elementary school to examine how the elements of Social Capital, Human Capital and Instructional Tools and Routines contributed to the academic success of ELL students. To understand these elements data were collected via interviews and document reviews. Data were analyzed by unitizing and categorizing interview transcripts and documents. The results of the case study demonstrated that the principal and teachers at this school were successful in developing Human Capital through the quality of their professional community interactions. It seems that the quality of the professional community at this school created norms of trust and collaboration that influenced the teachers' pedagogical content knowledge. The principal and teachers were successful in building Social Capital through the ways in which they shared what they knew. The principal and the teachers at this school created an environment of open collaboration, and through this collaboration they shared information about their teaching creating strong networks. The principal and the teachers created a professional community that they referred to as informal professional learning community. There was an overwhelming amount of data that illustrated how they created a very caring learning community. The data from this study did not reveal that the professional development opportunities being offered to the principal and teachers had been systematic. What was clear was that the utilization of the information generated from students' formative and summative assessment was utilized to develop strategies to individualize the students' instruction. The interconnection of Human Capital, Social Capital and Instructional Tools and Routines at this school appeared to have been instrumental in enabling the meeting of the needs of ELL students at this school.

It is a multiple, variegated set of activities designed to serve one purpose, namely, the instructional use of pupil's own language. As such, there are five interrelated aspects of the language experience approach that weave in and out of daily classroom practice. The first is the alphabet, whose usefulness lies in its letter names. Children proceed from letter names to letter sounds, especially with vowels. The second aspect, writing, includes &quot;invented spelling,&quot; a spelling that resembles phonetic spelling but has more profound origins. The breakdown of the rote recital of the alphabet into its component  letters allows words to be spelled on a letter name basis that should lead, in later grades, into formal, accurate, and correct spelling. Key vocabulary is the third aspect. It is a highly structured process in which the teacher elicits a personal word from the student in a specified, organized way. The fourth aspect,though not necessarily in this order, is that of the experience chart. From ideas presented by the students, the teacher writes on the chalkboard or easel the transmogrified ideas, repeating each word as it is written. The final aspect, the use of trade or library books, relates both to the language experience approach and the self-selection or individualized reading approach and involves children in reading books that they choose and like and reporting their reactions to the  teacher.

The purpose of the study is, therefore, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the textbook which will help the teachers do maximum application of its strengths in the classroom, and make sensible decisions about the weaknesses. This study followed the 'whilst-use' evaluation type, and adopted mainly the checklist method. The checklist was designed drawing on suitable criteria from the popular checklist developed by McDonough, Shaw and Masuhara (2013). In addition, a short semi-structured interview was conducted with 10 secondary English teachers in order to explore how the teachers would perceive and evaluate the textbook. Though the evaluation identified the textbook's rewarding features, it also revealed a number of limitations which require sincere attention of the curriculum and materials developers.

Action research enables teachers to investigate learners' reactions to new materials, and work with them to develop engaging context-specific materials.

The project was part of an innovative national programme for the Australian English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sector, initiated and facilitated by the second author (Anne) and the ELICOS peak body English Australia. An Assessment for Learning (AfL) theoretical framework was adopted to integrate lesson materials and assessment, based on learner needs. At the college, previous assessment preparation materials had been ad hoc, so Emily explored what materials would best support her learners in preparing for written assessments and feedback. Innovative classroom materials were developed in negotiation with learners, who were actively involved in the process through interviews, focus groups and surveys.

The dominant source of content is the materials, and the teachers' role is overlooked in providing useful language content. Furthermore, the mental operations have not been taken to the deepest level to promote students' creative and critical thinking skills. The findings also reveal that the materials have a sentence-based content, that is, the content provided as input to learners and content expected as output from the learners comprise individual words, phrases and sentences, and there are few opportunities for extended written and oral discourse. Consequently, it is recommended that teachers, researchers and materials developers should take into consideration such challenging findings to bridge the gap between theory and practice and to develop language materials effectively.

This work took place in the only course designed for Heritage language learners at a large public suburban university in the Northeast part of the United States. Grammatical simplification in bilingual speakers is due to incomplete acquisition of Spanish, attrition or loss of an underused linguistic system (Lynch, 1999; Martinez Mira, 2009a, 2009b; Mikulski, 2010b; Montrul, 2007; Ocampo, 1990; Silva-Corvalan, 1990, 1994a, 1994b, 2003; Studerus, 1995). The result of the process of simplification is reduction or loss of forms and/or meanings. In this work, I investigated in which ways Gal&apos;perin&apos;s (1989) systemic-theoretical organized instruction promoted awareness, control and internalization of the concept of modality in three sets of data: definition, discourse and verbalization (Negueruela, 2003). In addition, I examined how the concept of modality emerged and proceeded. By focusing students&apos; attention in Negueruela&apos;s (2003) Concept of Mood in Spanish orienting chart in a top down fashion, students were able to strengthen their theoretical understanding in practical activity while still accessing empirical knowledge, and eventually generalizing its use in new contexts across nominal, adjectival and adverbial clauses. At the definition level, Gal&apos;perin&apos;s Systemic-theoretical instruction promoted emergence and progress of their conceptual understanding from perceptual to semantic. At the discourse level, students&apos; theoretically based semantic understanding had a positive impact as revealed in student&apos;s discourse progress throughout tasks. At the verbalization level, semantic, abstract and systematic verbalizations showed students&apos; emergence of awareness of the interrelated categories of modality. The conceptual category of anticipation was appropriately verbalized and contextualized 68% of the time. The absence of quality verbalizations referring to a specific conceptual category in some students lead me to conclude that students did not fully understand the meaning of some conceptual categories. On the contrary, their presence in any of the tasks showed emergence of conceptual meaning(s) in appropriate contexts, further appropriate recontextualization may provide full awareness and control.

In a suggestopaedic course, music plays a large part in creating a pleasant suggestive atmosphere, thereby facilitating the lessening or removal of anti-suggestive psychological barriers. This assumption is particularly applicable to adult foreign language classes. Music helps to create a state of receptiveness induced by an apparent state of passiveness associated with a state of psychological relaxation and concentration of superior cerebral activity. Because research has frequently shown the positive effects of music, it  is possible to propose different hypotheses to explain the role of music in suggestopaedia. These hypotheses are also of interest because they may lead to research linking psychology and suggestopaedia. While it is not yet easy to determine the specific effects of music in a suggestopaedic approach, it seems that this approach, based on gestalt principles, answers some questions regarding the pedagogical use of the full capacity of the brain.

Findings from an analysis of field notes, teacher education artefacts, and interview transcripts demonstrate that pre-service teachers' linguistic and racial backgrounds shaped their learning and identity trajectories vis-\u00e0-vis plurilingualism, and that critical personal reflection and practicum experiences were key mediators of participants' orientations towards plurilingual pedagogies. Plurilingualism, in concert with multiliteracies, supported a Chinese Canadian pre-service teacher to develop a resource orientation to her own plurilingualism and racialized identity, while challenging a White English-dominant pre-service teacher to confront power inequities and her English-speaker privilege.

In this paper, we share the conception of instilling literacy by utilizing the Developmental Module Approach (DMA), an example of a systematic approach in improving literacy among a group of indigenous pupils specifically the Semai community from Terisu in Cameroon Highland, Pahang. In contrast, Malay Language is used as a medium in teaching across schools in Malaysia including elementary school of Orang Asli and a more significant second language use in the classroom by Orang Asli pupils. The finding has provided important insights for the development of the pedagogical module and may offer a clear understanding of reasons Orang Asli pupils lag behind in their academic attainment. Based on the interviews we found that among the problems faced in the Malay Language literacy are closely related to cultural and environment issues and how such disparities affect drop-out rate among Orang Asli pupils. The study is expected to provide input to the curriculum development center, educational administrators and teachers.

Intuitions are the culmination of perceptions that have been internalized and synthesized into patterns. Furthermore, they take time to develop. Consequently, if systematic instruction is to play a part in the formation of intuitions about written language then it must start early and be continuous. Instruction in paragraphing depends in part on how much experience the child has had writing sentences. Nevertheless, paragraph instruction in the elementary grades should focus on invention, writing a paragraph on one subject, and the visual form of the paragraph. The teacher should concentrate on training the student to become an accurate observer. The student can be taught to place things in classes and  ultimately to develop generalizations about these classes in the form of statements by listing reasons for placing them in these groups. Development of the paragraph should be introduced only in terms of adding facts about the same subject. At the secondary school level, continued practice in using various categorizing principles to sort and classify information should be encouraged. Instead of simply generating a main idea, students can be made aware of the characteristics of the topic sentence and how topic sentences can differ in terms of the role that they play. An understanding of the completeness should be taught after initial mastery of the topic sentence because the student will than have an awareness of the effect of the topic sentence on setting parameters for the paragraph.  Then, development, coherence, and rhetorical function can be emphasized. Such an increasingly detailed analysis of the paragraph is one that should result in increasingly sophisticated writing intuitions.

The participants were 57 student teachers, 19 college teachers, and 28 junior high school teachers. Four instruments were used: a written consent form, a questionnaire about 15 teaching skills (&quot;The Teaching Skill Questionnaire&quot;), a 60-minute videotape with a checklist (&quot;The Japanese COLT&quot;), and a 42-item questionnaire (&quot;The Student Teachers' Videotaped Instruction&quot;).    The study produced four major findings. First, by using the Japanese COLT (Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching Observation scheme), the three groups of raters (student teachers, college teachers, practicum supervisor) identified four specific problems with individual student teacher's teaching. They (a) explained new sentence patterns without interacting with the students, (b) asked fewer questions than expected, (c) had the students practice reading for a shorter time than expected, and (d) provided few opportunities for the students to speak in Japanese or English, and spoke Japanese more than necessary. The second finding was that the student teachers differed from the older teacher groups in their views of specific teaching skills because of their limited teaching experience and lower English proficiency. The third finding was that the three groups of raters perceived the student teachers' teaching on the videotape similarly. The fourth finding indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in the three groups' views of the teaching techniques used by the student teachers; however, a statistically significant difference was found for the three groups' evaluations of the student teachers' teaching.    The Japanese COLT was a useful instrument for assessing the student teachers' classroom performances, as it provided more specific feedback to the student teachers, and allowed the three groups to share their viewpoints more effectively.

A systematic data collection format to evaluate each child's progress in four major areas (language skills, motor skills, cognitive skills, and self-help skills) was employed either at home or in the  school. The normative data indicated that children's rate of achieving developmental milestones was significantly accelerated in mental development and language development for the school program and in mental development for the home program.

Readers will gain a solid overview of the Montessori philosophy and method, specifically those related to reading and language development, enabling them to support their practice in today's educational context while inspiring the wider field of education. The authors explain how the Montessori approach is inherently aligned with the Science of Reading in that they are both scientifically based and contain methods that follow a logical, systematic, and explicit progression of teaching and learning. Montessori education supports instructional differentiation that is cognizant of children's need for independence and highly mindful of literacy and language development. This book provides valuable contributions to all educators implementing Science of Reading and structured literacy in their practice, and is a must-have for Montessori teachers (preschool to grade 3) and those that prepare, coach, and supervise them. This book: (1) Aligns the Montessori curriculum to reading research, currently known as the Science of Reading; (2) Explains how the Montessori curriculum builds reading skills, background knowledge, and vocabulary across disciplines; (3) Shows educators how to balance state requirements and standards with maintaining a pedagogy aligned with Montessori principles; (4) Provides descriptions of teaching materials, classroom examples, and images; (5) Demonstrates how to use Montessori methods to support multiculturalism and differentiation to meet the needs of diverse students; (6) Includes suggested progressions of development, such as phonological awareness, that extend lessons using the Movable Alphabet; and (7) Explores multisensory approaches to language and literacy instruction.

Learning to read in those formative years is essential to develop the higher order thinking skills demanded in the older grades, when students are reading to learn. Beginning readers must be engaged in highly purposeful and strategic techniques implemented by their teachers. First phonological awareness and knowledge of letters must be introduced. Activities centered around building an understanding of phonemes are essential to learning how to read an alphabetic language. With a systematic approach such as &quot;Zoo-phonics,&quot; children learn the names and sounds of letters and are soon able to recognize and form their corresponding shapes. In kindergarten and  first grade an integral part of any curriculum is reading aloud, which provides students with the opportunity to hear and see an enthusiastic teacher demonstrating good reading on a regular basis. Shared reading with a great deal of repetition is probably one of the most effective strategies for extending students' involvement in the literacy process and developing more proficient readers. Research indicates that reading can be taught most effectively with a balanced approach that incorporates the best of both phonics instruction and whole language. (Contains eight references.)

Second, state and local officials must become more systematic in how data on ELs are collected and used, by tracking students' progress over longer time periods and by including all students who were ever ELs in accountability metrics.

Reflecting this challenge is the heightened anxiety among EFL students, whose work has been associated with historically meager results. Blended learning, the fusion of face-to-face and online content delivery and assessment, offers a promising solution to EFL learner reticence. Evidence suggests that an active online teacher presence in a blended EFL course can enhance student engagement. The purpose of this study was to discover the perceptions of EFL instructional specialists concerning (a) student involvement and engagement in online portions of blended courses, (b) marginal teacher presence in the online portions of blended courses, and (c) ways to improve student involvement in the online portions of the blended courses. Results of a systematic qualitative analysis, employing constant comparative data analysis of individual interviews with a sample of 10 voluntary EFL instructional specialists, indicated teachers need to take part in design of blended EFL courses to address these issues. The findings, coupled with theoretical frameworks of social-constructivism, transactional distance, diffusion of innovation, and universal design for instruction, served as the background for a proposed teacher training project resulting from this study. The study can contribute to positive social change by inviting EFL teachers to become more involved in blended course design, increasing their sense of ownership, sharing best practices for blended EFL teaching and learning, and creating conditions for more successful upward social mobility opportunities for Chilean university students who have acquired certifiable English language skills.

Measures of learning with high pedagogical validity often have poor psychometric properties. Conversely, tests that are well-constructed by psychometric standards may succeed in sorting and ordering students or schools, but have little pedagogical relevance. There are several approaches for dealing with apparent trade-off. One way is to revise notions of achievement, moving away from test-based criteria toward performance-based criteria. Experience in native- and second-language learning is cited as instructive, because of the multidimensional emphasis on the goals of communication in realistic settings. Valid assessment depends on situation and mode of communication. A systematic,  cumulative record of performance is essential to this approach. The writing folder, a dossier kept by the student of diverse samples of his or her writing, is a good example of such a record. Another approach connects the monitoring function of assessment to the learning function at the classroom level. It uses comprehensive item pools administered by item sampling as part of a survey of teaching and learning specifically designed to reflect school learning and suggest improvements. As an example, the Second International Mathematics Study is discussed.

Revised", "author": null, "description": "The Center for Adult English Language Acquisition (CAELA) Network, under contract with the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), has created a framework that can be used to plan, implement, and evaluate professional development for practitioners working with adult English language learners at the state, regional, and program levels. The framework addresses the need to improve student learning and facilitate learner progress through and beyond programs and, as a result, the need for high-quality adult education practitioners and professional development programs for them. This framework focuses on the knowledge and skills that teachers and administrators need, as well as the systems and processes necessary to help them work effectively with the adult English language learners in their programs. State- and program-level administrators, professional developers, teacher trainers, and teachers can use this framework as they seek to improve instruction with the goal of facilitating learner progress through a systematic, coherent, and sustainable professional development effort. This program improvement process can enhance the design of professional development opportunities, which can in turn improve instructional quality, practitioner responses to learner needs, and learners' progress. The desired outcome is a workforce of trained, knowledgeable practitioners who can respond to the needs of adult English language learners through high-quality, evidence-based practice. The framework has three components: (1) The \"content\" that practitioners need to be successful in working with adult English language learners; (2) The \"process\" for planning, implementing, and evaluating professional development for practitioners; and (3) The \"context\" in which professional development is provided. Each of these components, with its specific elements, is described in this paper. Background is appended. (Contains 1 figure.)

Two sources of information were the research literature and extant data from states on training activities. Findings indicated that training for adult education teachers and volunteer instructors was influenced by factors related to ABE and ESL instruction. Section 353 of the Adult Education Act was the primary source of funding for training. Training services were provided by state, regional, and local agencies, which offered varied training activities. Many states relied on multiple training formats. Single workshops and single conferences were the primary method for training, even though \"one-shot\" staff  development experiences were not as effective as longer-term multiple-session approaches. Highlighted features of effective training programs showed that they: are based on systematically identified needs, involve teacher participants in planning and decision making, maintain a positive climate, show evidence of systematic decision making, reflect up-to-date knowledge, and reflect continuity. Two categories of content for training were identified. Subject matter content should include basic skills, higher order skills, and second language acquisition. Pedagogical content as it related specifically to teaching ABE and ESL participants was necessary.

This relationship is thought to be due to the cognitive load which results when attention is required by writers to write letters and words on the page. Lack of automaticity in orthographic-motor integration means that writers do not have sufficient cognitive resources to accomplish the more demanding aspects of text production such as ideation, text monitoring, and pragmatic awareness. A systematic handwriting program can significantly improve the quality of written text by young children experiencing problems with orthographic-motor integration. This study investigated the effectiveness of a handwriting program in remediating older students' problems in orthographic-motor integration and consequently enhancing their written language skills. Two groups of students in Grades 8 and 9 were provided with either practice in handwriting or daily completion of a written journal. There were no differences between the two groups at pre-test. However, at post-test, the handwriting group had significantly higher scores in orthographic-motor integration as well as for the length and quality of the text they wrote.", "subject": "Grade 8, Grade 9, Written Language, Handwriting, Psychomotor Skills, Journal Writing, Writing Instruction, Skill Development, Writing Skills, Teaching Methods", "source": "Educational Psychology", "publicationdateyear": 2005.0}, {"title": "Literacy Foundations for English Learners: A Comprehensive Guide to Evidence-Based Instruction", "author": "C\u00e1rdenas-Hagan, Elsa, Ed.", "description": "More than 5 million English learners attend U.S. public schools--and yet fewer than 3% of teachers are certified to work with them.

However, there is compelling evidence for the benefits of direct vocabulary instruction (Elleman, Lindo, Morphy, &amp; Compton, 2009; Laufer &amp; Rozovski-Roitblat, 2015). Due to the volume of vocabulary acquisition that is needed, time considerations and subjectivity can make instructional vocabulary selection seem futile. To overcome these issues, the use of corpora has enhanced the possibilities of identifying high-frequency lexical items in a systematic and more objective manner. Drawing on insights from multiple disciplines, this dissertation adopts a corpus-based approach for the selection and teaching of high-frequency interdisciplinary academic vocabulary in a model that accommodates the needs of students in university reading support courses. The adopted corpus-based model identifies instructional vocabulary with the support of the Word and Phrase Tool (Davies, 2013), a Web interface that allows users to scan texts in order to gain instructional information about their lexical profiles. Considering academic vocabulary to be an interrelated feature of academic language, the dissertation shows how a well-designed empirical selection process can advance the capabilities of instructors in ways that address some valid concerns of earlier word list approaches. The instructional portion of the model is organized around a researcher-developed method called &quot;item discussions&quot; that uses a graphic organizer for students to record vocabulary explorations that are attentive to known aspects of vocabulary development such as definition, morphology, and synonymy and, additionally, to generate sentences using each term in a context similar to that in which it was encountered. To further investigate the effectiveness of this corpus-based instructional model, a preliminary small-scale experimental study was conducted with students enrolled in two reading support classes at a large university (N = 18). Moderate to strong effect sizes were found for similar-to-instructional context encounters (g = 0.73) and the full instructional model (g = 0.95), suggesting that the model offers a promising approach. The discussion includes pedagogical implications and further directions for research and implementation. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Within the context of teaching poetry writing to second language learners, the current article develops a scientific approach to ways in which voice can be measured and then empirically explores the claim that voice is present within poetry written by second language learners. The study explored this question: Do second language poetry writers have a discernable voice in their written poetry? This issue was investigated in two different ways: (a) utilizing human reader ratings of the likelihood that two poems were written by the same poet and (b) using computational linguistic methodology to explore systematic differences in specific linguistic features in poetry written by second language poets. The data presented here show that poetry written by the same L2 writer is more readily recognized as such and that relevant linguistic items have patterns of frequency of usage that are different for different poets. Together the two studies provide a compelling case that voice is measureable and present in the poetry written by second language learners.", "subject": "English (Second Language), Creative Writing, Poetry, Computational Linguistics, Self Expression, Literary Styles, Word Frequency, Applied Linguistics, College Students, Writing Instruction, Hypothesis Testing", "source": "Written Communication", "publicationdateyear": 2015.0}, {"title": "Digital Storytelling in ESL Instruction: Identity Negotiation through a Pedagogy of Multiliteracies", "author": "Vinogradova, Polina", "description": "This qualitative descriptive exploratory study investigated how a pedagogy of multiliteracies can be introduced to the ESL curriculum using digital stories and explored the ways ESL learners negotiate their identities through the multimodality of this narrative genre. The study was based on the premise that in language education it is crucial to account for multimodality of discourses and bring students' diverse lifeworlds and experiences into the classroom thus extending an understanding of literacy to multimodal communication and inviting ESL learners to explore their multilayered and dynamic identities. The study elicited data through focused participant observations, content analysis of students' essays, weekly journals, and final semi-structured interviews, and through discourse analysis of the students' drafts of verbal narratives for digital stories, digital storyboards, and final digital storytelling projects. The findings revealed the presence of situated practice; overt instruction; critical framing; and, in a more limited way, transformed practice. While situated practice evolved with the students narrating about their families, life-changing events, and important cultural practices, overt instruction included explicit and systematic instruction and scaffolding that fostered students' multimodal meaning making through story writing and production. Combined with situated practice it resulted in critical framing when students reflected on their progress as language learners and analyzed multimodal cultural representations in their digital stories. Some nascent examples of transformed practice were evident when students suggested how the projects had influenced their overall approaches to learning and understanding of meaning making. Students negotiated their identities through the process and product of digital stories. The study revealed that none of the participants articulated as central an ESL student identity indicating that this social role was not particularly significant at the time of the digital story project. Instead, the students were storytellers and producers, mothers and sons, daughters and sisters, granddaughters and world travelers, friends, women and men, and people with unique cultural backgrounds and social experiences. And since the students were in constant communication with each other, personal stories became experiences that moved other students and influenced their understanding of cultural diversity. This collaborative process created a multicultural classroom community of practice conducive to the recognition of diverse identities and social roles.

However, its Turkish translation &quot;G\u00fcn Isigi&quot; by Adnan Semih Yazicioglu tends to create a very different narrative by transforming signs related to Istanbul and some Orientalist clich\u00e9s. In this study, the image of the East as constructed by the West is analyzed through Edward Said's concept of &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1979). The novel is divided into segments to highlight the parts taking place in Istanbul, and the clash between East and West is analyzed through the concept of isotopy and the semiotic square (Greimas &amp; Court\u00e9s, 1982).

The role of language learning advisers emerged about two decades ago as a result of the expansion of self-access centres in higher education and their pivotal position in the promotion of autonomous language learning. This resulted in a proliferation of studies focused on describing LLA activities and skills as clearly distinct from those of language teaching. Through the analysis of some extracts from LLA sessions, advisers' individual and peer reflective accounts, and a shared group debriefing, this study attempts to illustrate how the use of intentional dialogue as a pedagogic device and discourse analysis as a methodological approach, can positively trigger a transformative process in the professional development of advisers and can support them in becoming reflective practitioners and practitioner researchers. Although this is a preliminary, small-scale, localised study, it offers an insight into this emerging professional practice; it explains the need for advisers to develop their set of tools and discourses to describe and evaluate their practice; it contextualises the importance of grounding this emerging professional practice within specific theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches.

Reading is dying in our schools. Educators are familiar with many of the factors that have contributed to the decline--poverty, second-language issues, and the ever-expanding choices of electronic entertainment. In this provocative new book, Kelly Gallagher suggests, however, that it is time to recognize a new and significant contributor to the death of reading: our schools. In \"Readicide,\" Kelly argues that American schools are actively (though unwittingly) furthering the decline of reading. Specifically, he contends that the standard instructional practices used in most schools are killing reading by: (1) valuing the development of test-takers over the development of lifelong readers; (2) mandating breadth over depth in instruction; (3) requiring students to read difficult texts without proper instructional support; insisting that students focus solely on academic texts; (4) drowning great books with sticky notes, double-entry journals, and marginalia; (5) ignoring the importance of developing recreational reading; (6) and losing sight of authentic instruction in the shadow of political pressures.

The aim of this qualitative case study was to examine arts-based approaches in relation to optimizing cognitive growth and offering alternative learning opportunities for English language learners. Multiple intelligences theory, artful learning approach, active learning, and cognitive gains through arts integration comprised the conceptual framework for this study. Participants were randomly selected through maximum variation sampling, and included 6 general educators, 1 arts specialist, and 1 administrator. Data sources included semistructured interviews, arts-integrated units/lessons, and arts-based artifacts. Data analysis included open and selective coding for common themes to answer the guiding research questions. The results indicated the arts support an array of positive influences on student engagement and cognitive growth. These findings revealed the importance of offering general education teachers appropriate arts-integrated professional development opportunities, a variety of arts-integrated classroom supports, and a systematic process for integrating the arts. In particular, participants identified certain lesson outlines and types of training workshops that proved particularly useful for teachers working to integrate arts instruction. The study contributes to positive social change by providing decision makers with methods schools can use to integrate the arts into classroom instruction to promote engagement in all subject areas.

It is unclear and controversial as to whether heritage languages learners are exposed to early but are interrupted manifest as L1 competence or share more characteristics with development in L2/FL competence. However, a common misconception is that HLLs outperform NHLLs in overall language skills even though Korean HLLs in Korean as a Foreign Language (KFL) classes do not make better progress than NHLLs despite their comparatively stronger aural interpretive abilities. This study was designed to investigate whether HLLs have an advantage over NHLLs in learning distinctive parametric values in Korean language, through comparing occurrences and sources of grammatical errors exhibited by two groups taking university-level KFL classes. This study addresses Korean inflectional morphemes, with a focus on case and postposition markers and affixal connectives. Data was collected from error analysis (EA) of inflectional morpheme errors and its source on semi-guided and self-generated writing samples, and grammaticality judgment in a word completion (GJWC) test using the same inflectional morphemes used for the EA. Schlyter's Weak language (WL) as L2, Montrul's WL as L1, and the Missing Surface Inflection Hypothesis (MSIH) provided theoretical frameworks. The EA data was coded using the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcript program. The EA and GJWC data were analyzed using a &quot;2-way&quot; ANOVA and, when there was a significant interaction effect between heritage status and language proficiency level, a &quot;1-way&quot; ANOVA. This study's results confirmed Schlyter's hypothesis, but did not support Montrul's hypothesis from either the EA or GJWC. MSIH failed in explaining underlying linguistic competence of HLLs. Significantly higher error rates caused by omitting necessary subject and object markers among HLLs imply their Korean morphological data stays at the level of Korean child's morphology. Significantly higher error rates in instrument marker in the GJWC test by advanced level of HLLs imply impaired Korean morphology of HLLs. Linguistic variation is more prominent among HLL group. Findings are further discussed in relation to their theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical implications. Differentiated instructional and curricular approaches for HLL and NHLL groups are suggested. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Chomsky's language acquisition theory and Vygotsky's social constructivism theory provided frameworks for this study. The research questions were directed at describing how teachers taught bidialectal, English-speaking Caribbean American students to read. Data were collected from a purposeful sample of experienced teachers through interviews, observations, and document analysis. Data were analyzed using a simple word by word, line-by-line coding, incident-by-incident coding, and by discovering patterns and emerging themes through triangulation of data from transcripts, classroom observations, and lesson plans. Results suggested the need for a systematic approach to address reading difficulties associated with bidialectal interference among students at all grade levels. A key recommendation was for teachers to use students' dialect as a foundation to scaffold new literacy skills. A project professional development training guide was constructed for the district using the results of this study. The suggestions in the guide could promote positive social change as teachers at the site develop the skills and understandings to enhance the reading achievement of bidialectal, English-speaking students.

These emergent literacy experiences provide a foundation for conventional literacy skills. A congenital visual impairment (that is, blindness or low vision) may affect a child's language development and access to visually based emergent literacy. Consequently, toddlers with visual impairments require systematic intervention practices to promote emergent literacy skills. However, given the limited research base of practice guidance in the field of visual impairment (Ferrell, 2006; Hatton, 2014), this report explores &quot;promising practices&quot; for promoting emergent literacy skills in toddlers with visual impairments.

Challenging moves therefore served both dialogical and monological discursive purposes. Communicating moves (probing, embodying, requesting clarification) appeared mostly in the initial cycles of the negotiations, thus, serving dialogical purposes.

In the worksheets they were asked to first explain in writing why or why not a shadow was formed and then explain shadow formation through a drawing. At an overall level, we found that a majority of the pupils managed to express in writing why a shadow is formed, though it appeared to be more challenging for them to explain why a shadow is not formed. In their drawings, quite a few pupils managed to include several key aspects of shadow formation, at least when combining image with writing. For all tasks, the explanatory parts of the pupils' responses were often implicit.

This research study was guided by the conceptual framework of Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and Tomlinson's theory of implementing differentiated instruction. The research questions investigated teachers' perceptions of differentiated instruction and their professional development for mediating instruction for ELLs. Six teachers from Grades 1 to 3 who teach ELLs with limited English-speaking ability and 2 ELL teachers participated in the study. Data were collected from transcribed interviews, open-ended surveys, and lesson plans. Inductive analysis was used to identify themes and commonalities within the collected data. The major themes included that differentiation is crucial for ELL instruction, teachers use varied instructional strategies to meet ELLs' individual needs, and teachers want purposeful and relevant professional development to meet ELLs' academic needs. The findings indicated a need for a professional development that include a systematic approach to differentiated instructional strategies to improve academic achievement for ELLs. A 3-day professional development was designed. The findings of this study and professional development may contribute to positive social change by increasing teachers' use of instructional strategies that align with the district's guidelines to improve learning and achievement for ELLs.

This study identified the common curricular and instructional approaches used by the 3 schools involved in this study. Five characteristics that contributed to the reading achievement success at these schools emerged from the cross-case data analysis. These schools (a) ensured that the core reading curriculum selected met the criteria for being predicated on scientifically based reading research and addressed the essential components of reading instruction, (b) provided an opportunity for teacher involvement in the curriculum selection process, (c) allotted a minimum of 90 minutes daily for reading and language arts instruction, (d) utilized a systematic data assessment process to inform and differentiate instruction, and (e) provided appropriate and ongoing teacher professional development.

Hord's professional learning community (PLC) model grounded the conceptual framework for this study with a culture of continuous, shared inquiry based on collegial trust. The research question investigated teachers' perceptions regarding how PLC teachers are able to differentiate instruction for ELL students in mathematics classrooms. A case study design included transcripts from semistructured interviews, member checking, and PLC minutes. A purposeful, unique convenience sampling technique was used to recruit 4 mathematics teachers from both the 6th and 7th grade PLCs for a total of 8 interviews.

Although specific programs have been found to be more effective and evaluated more than others, teaching practices in CSR schools have received less attention. This study focuses on observations of math and reading/language arts lessons in classrooms implementing an array of CSR programs to better understand what occurs in CSR classrooms. Research Question: This article describes observed instructional practices and teacher-student dynamics that occurred in CSR classrooms in two different subject areas, reading/language arts and math, in Grades 3-5. Reading/language arts included several literacy-related areas such as spelling, vocabulary, phonetics, and writing. Math primarily consisted of computations and math applications. Our primary research questions were: (1) Does subject matter matter in CSR classrooms? (2) How does instruction in CSR classrooms differ among Grades 3, 4, and 5? (3) Are there major differences in classroom practices between fall and spring? Population: Teachers (N = 104) in Grades 3-5 in 16 CSR schools, totaling 248 observation periods in math and reading/language arts lessons. Research Design: Observational study using a systematic coding system to observe student/teacher classroom behaviors and dispositions. Data Analysis: Data were analyzed using basic descriptive statistics and analysis of variance procedures. Conclusion: We found that students were productively involved in assigned tasks and that classrooms were pleasant and task oriented in both mathematics and reading/language arts. Some subject matter differences were notable, particularly that math lessons were more structured and rigid than were reading/language arts lessons. Also of interest, third- and fifth-grade classrooms experienced more positive teacher-student relationships than did fourth-grade classrooms. Furthermore, instruction in the fall was more structured and more focused on basic skills than in the spring. Overall, students appeared to be engaged in learning basic facts/skills in an uninterrupted teacher-directed classroom.

There is a need for all students to become problems solvers and innovators and not just repeaters of information. It is crucial that their learning experiences are linked to their cultural backgrounds and make connections to their personal lives.

The study of past stages of a linguistic system and the overarching linguistic patterns characterizing the arc of change over time characterize the field of linguistics known as historical linguistics. Historical linguistics serves to illuminate both the sources and earlier phonetic and morphosyntactic features of a given language and the present trajectories and modern features of those same systems. This has implications for Second Language Acquisition. Indeed, existing literature suggests that instruction in various aspects of historical linguistics correlates positively with increased confidence, motivation, global competence, and multicultural identity. This study explored the effects of introductory historical linguistics exposure on the L2 Motivational Self as defined by Dornyei (2005) and revisualized for multilingual learners by Ushioda (2017) and Lasagabaster (2014), among others. After a one-week treatment period, qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed to determine if changes could be detected in middle and high school language learners' levels of motivation, enjoyment, and sense of identity in the foreign language classroom. Quantitative results revealed significant results in the areas of self-efficacy and metalinguistic awareness. Qualitative analysis revealed strong support for increased L2 enjoyment, L2 motivation, and self-efficacy, and revealed moderate support for lowered L2 anxiety and higher self-confidence.

Since the human mind cannot visualize those four dimensions, a popular analogy compares the universe to a two-dimensional rubber sheet distorted by massive objects. This analogy is often used when teaching GR to upper secondary and undergraduate physics students. However, physicists and physics educators criticize the analogy for being inaccurate and for introducing conceptual conflicts. Addressing these criticisms, we analyze the rubber sheet analogy through systematic metaphor analysis of textbooks and research literature, and present an empirical analysis of upper secondary school students' use and understanding of the analogy. Taking a theoretical perspective of embodied cognition allows us to account for the relationship between the experiential and sensory aspects of the metaphor in relation to the abstract nature of spacetime. We employ methods of metaphor and thematic analysis to study written accounts of small groups of 97 students (18-19\u00a0years old) who worked with a collaborative online learning environment as part of their regular physics lessons in five classes in Norway. Students generated conceptual metaphors found in the literature as well as novel ones that led to different conceptions of gravity than those held by experts in the field. Even though most students showed awareness of some limitations of the analogy, we observed a conflict between students' embodied understanding of gravity and the abstract description of GR. This conflict might add to the common perception of GR being counterintuitive. In making explicit strengths and weaknesses of the rubber sheet analogy and learners' conceptual difficulties, our results offer guidance for teaching GR.

Ultimately, we sought in the experts' convergence or divergence insights on the relative importance of the relevant factors that may aid writing instruction, particularly for young children. We present a study using an expert knowledge elicitation method in which representatives from five domains of expertise pertaining to writing rated 28 factors (i.e., individual skills and attributes) covering six areas (general knowledge and cognition, creative cognition, conation, executive functioning, linguistic and psychomotor skills), according to their importance for creative writing. A Many-Facets Rasch Measurement (MFRM) model permitted us to quantify the relative importance of these writing factors across domain-specific expertise, while controlling for expert severity and other systematic evaluation biases. The identified similarities and domain-specific differences in the expert views offer a new basis for understanding the conceptual gaps between the scientific literature on creative writing, the writer's self-reflection on the act of writing creatively, and educators' practices in teaching creative writing. Bridging such diverse approaches--that are, yet, relatively homogeneous within areas of expertise--appears to be useful in view of formulating process-oriented writing pedagogy that may, above all, better target the skills needed to improve children's creative writing development.

Linguistic investigation has established the following points: (1) There is a Black English dialect; (2) Black English has systematic rules which differ from those of Standard English; (3) There are indications that lead to the conclusion that there are historical connections between Black English and coastal West African languages. Black English has a cohesive, structured grammatical system, i.e., it is a language system. According to the creolization theory, black people brought to the New World as slaves first learned a form of pidgin English. This theory postulates that Black English developed as a result of the following influences: language interference, nonstandard  linguistic models, and isolation factors. The languages which are the most significant to the historical study of American black dialects are those which were spoken in the Guinea slave coast area; most of them are in the Niger-Congo language family. Black English has two perfective distinctions in its verb system which have no equivalents in Standard English. The grammatical characteristics common to Black English verbs also occur in West African languages. An immediate implication of this study is that the history of the English language must be broadened to include the Afro-American tradition.

A study using 2000 census data showed that people who were not English proficient experienced lower earnings than those who spoke only English (Community and Regional Development Estate, 2005). The cost of being a non-proficient English speaker has the potential to decrease one's earning and perpetuate the poverty cycle, which is already higher for individuals of color (Wagmiller &amp; Adelman, 2009). The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (2016) reports that between 2014 and 2015, there were 4.6 million students in public schools who were considered English Learners. Per the same source, that number continues to rise (NCES, 2016). In 2016, Arizona assessed 33,520 Limited English Proficient (LEP) students (Arizona Department of Education [ADE], 2016). This number rose to 42,767 in 2017 (ADE, 2017b). While the number of English Learners in our classrooms may be increasing, our progression in moving the needle for their academic achievement is seemingly stagnant. Why? In 2017, Arizona English Learners continue to lag behind their peers on statewide standards testing despite years passing since No Child Left Behind regulation and Move on When Reading laws. In response to legislation, Arizona has enacted English-Only instruction and requires that English Learners partake in a Structured English Immersion (SEI) Program or an Individual Language Learner Plan (ILLP), unless specifically withdrawn by a parent (PW). No current data exist to illustrate whether there is a significant difference amongst academic achievement by English Learner students participating in a Structured English Immersion classroom, an Individual Language Learner Plan, or a Parent Withdrawal from the English Learner III Program. This translates to educators are teaching using various program models sans evidence of which yields higher student achievement or English Language Arts proficiency. The researcher proposed a quantitative study to determine whether there was a significant difference amongst English Learner students participating in a Structured English Immersion classroom, or on an Individual Language Learner Plan, or a Parent Withdrawal from the English Learner Program in the area of student academic achievement as measured by Arizona's Measurement of Educational Readiness to Inform Teaching (AzMERIT) English Language Arts (ELA). Material for the proposed study included various resources provided by the Arizona Department of Education, American Institutes for Research, National Center for Education Statistics, The Annie E. Casey Foundation, as well as the works of linguistics experts, language acquisition researchers and education reformers. Using a quantitative research method offered the opportunity to study information in a formal, objective, and systematic way. The independent variables were English Learner Program Models and the dependent variable was the student achievement outcome after students participated in an English Learner Program. The implication on education, specifically education in Arizona, was the opportunity to compare current program models used to achieve English Language Arts proficiency and suggest for utilization, best practices based on real-student evidence.

This study focuses on the systematic integration of issues of race and racism within the confines of a standardized curriculum. A thematic analysis of the students' initial perceptions about race showed that the students were unsure how to define race, perceived race as a Black and White dichotomy, did not consider themselves to be racial beings, and felt uncomfortable talking about race. A thematic analysis of authentic student work exhibited learning within all four Teaching Tolerance Anti-Bias domains. Students described their identities, understood that group identities were only a part of one's identity and appreciated differences. Students exhibited curiosity about and acceptance of diverse lived experiences and desired to get along with all people. They also increased their awareness of injustice and unfair treatment, rejected discrimination and oppression, reported willingness to speak out against injustice and realized the importance of working with others when advocating for a more equitable society. The students showed progress in all four domains and simultaneously mastered content standards, evidenced by the American Institute for Research test scores. Issues that emerged throughout the course of the study included students' discomfort and insecurity when talking about race and the inability for some students to move past the color-blind ideology. Additional roadblocks included resistance from colleagues and the intersectionality of race and social class.

One approach to combat this dilemma is the implementation of scripted reading programs. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of scripted reading programs on teacher and student outcomes. The study used three research questions to examine differences in post-test English Language Arts (ELA) achievement scores for third through fifth grade students taught using a scripted reading curriculum or traditional reading curriculum. A fourth research question examined the differences in post-test Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) growth scores of fourth and fifth grade teachers using a scripted or traditional reading curriculum. This quantitative study included preexisting data. The results of the study were conclusive. Based on the treatment method, the results revealed there were no statistically significant differences in third through fifth grade students' post-test ELA achievement scores. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in fourth and fifth grade teachers' post-test ELA TVAAS growth scores based on the treatment method. Based on findings from the study, additional goals, strategies, and action steps are needed beyond systematic reading program implementation to ensure every child is a proficient reader and reading on or above grade level.

The annotated document is then stored both by the teacher and the student, never to be looked at again. Whereas earlier student generations were educated and trained to process all annotations conscientiously and incorporate them in new assignments, today's students need to be motivated by &quot;triggers and rewards&quot; in order to acquire new contents, skills and attitudes. Using digital marking and the internet can trigger their motivation and metacognitive strategies, but does not guarantee by itself a much higher learning effect. Psycholinguistic research on learning effects reports that more than half of the structures one learns are lost in less than 24 hours, recurrent exposure to the material being the only remedy (Cervero and Pichardo Castro 2000, Schmitt 2000, Hulstijn 2001, Wesche and Paribakht 2000).

Research has shown a significant positive relationship between reading fluency and reading comprehension. However, little is known about writing fluency and its connection with reading comprehension.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between reading fluency, writing fluency, and reading comprehension. First, using the principles of assessing reading fluency, I designed a writing assessment and measured the writing fluency of 54 3rd graders. I examined the writing assessments as they related to the students' reading fluency and reading comprehension scores. Secondly, I performed a quasi-experimental scientific study with 3rd grade students. The control group (n=36) were taught the board-adopted language arts curriculum, while the experimental group (n=18) had systematic direct instruction in reading and writing fluency in addition to the regular language arts curriculum.    The research questions were: What is the relationship between students' reading comprehension and reading fluency among a group of third graders? What is the relationship between their rending comprehension and writing fluency? What is the relationship between their reading fluency and writing fluency? Will the experimental group of students with direct instruction in reading and writing fluency outperform the control group in reading comprehension? What other factors are involved in increasing reading comprehension?    Pearson's correlation statistic, paired t-tests, independent samples t-tests, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data. All statistical analyses were performed using PASW (formerly SPSS) for Windows.    Consistent with reading research, the results showed there was a strongly positive correlation between reading comprehension and reading fluency. This study also found a correlation between reading comprehension and writing as well as a correlation between reading comprehension and writing fluency. However, the link between reading comprehension and writing fluency was not found in pretest measurement, or the posttest-pretest measurement. The ANOVA results showed that reading and writing fluency explained a statistically significant 50% of the total variance in reading comprehension scores. This study also showed a strong positive correlation between reading fluency and writing fluency in the posttest measurement. In the quasi-experimental study, the experimental group did not outperform the experimental group: both groups made significant progress.    The major implication of this study is that writing could help increase reading comprehension, which results in another tool for teachers to use in teaching reading comprehension. This could result in an additional emphasis in teaching writing skills in the classroom.    [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Children with early language deficits who are growing up in poverty are dually at risk. Early deficits in language development predict both continued delays in language development and problems in acquisition of reading-related skills (Dickinson, McCabe, Anastasopoulos, Peisner-Feinberg &amp; Poe, 2003; Snow, Burns &amp; Griffen, 1998; Spira, Storch &amp; Fischel, 2005; Storch &amp; Whitehurst, 2002; Walker, Greenwood, Hart &amp; Carta, 1994). Early emergent problem behavior, particularly in children with low language skills, also predicts difficulties in reading, academic performance and peer relationships (Hester &amp; Kaiser, l998). Without effective early intervention to teach language and emergent literacy skills, many of these children will require intensive, long-term special education. This paper reports findings from a large randomized field trial examining the effects of three variations of early literacy curricula implemented in Head Start classrooms on children with low language and matched children with average language skills. This project involved the comparison of three conditions: &quot;Opening the World of Learning&quot; (&quot;OWL&quot;), &quot;OWL&quot; combined with &quot;Enhanced Milieu Teaching&quot; (&quot;EMT&quot;) for low language children, and an enhanced version of &quot;Creative Curriculum&quot; (&quot;CC&quot;), the existing literacy program used by the Head Start center. Effects of the preschool curricula on children's end of preschool, end of kindergarten, and end of first grade outcomes were examined. This intervention took place in Head Start preschool classrooms in Birmingham, Alabama. Overall, there were few systematic differences in language and literacy outcomes across time for low language and matched typical language children. Outcomes varied by child language status (low vs. matched language) and assessment time (end of preschool vs. end of K vs. end of 1st). The results were not those anticipated. Four potential explanations are being considered and examined in follow up analyses of predictors of child outcomes, teacher implementation fidelity, and &quot;active ingredients&quot; (specific teacher behaviors associated with positive language and literacy outcomes).

However, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, between 2007 and 2013, no more than 55\u00a0percent of Mississippi grade 4 students were reading at or above the proficiency level that demonstrates solid academic performance for the grade assessed. This was of serious concern to educators and policymakers in Mississippi. Thus, in April 2013, Mississippi's Literacy-Based Promotion Act was signed into law with the goal of having every student read at or above grade level by the end of grade 3. In response to the act, in January of 2014 the Mississippi Department of Education began providing early literacy professional development to all K-3 educators using the Language Essentials for Teaching Reading and Spelling program. Participants received the professional development content across eight modules split into two phases. Each phase included six weeks of online coursework and three days of face-to-face workshops. Typically, educators completed one phase per academic year. Content ranged from learning the foundations of language and reading to teaching comprehension strategies and writing instruction. At the same time as the professional development, the department provided state literacy coaches to target schools (those most in need based on the percentage of students in the lowest two achievement levels on the statewide literacy assessment). The state literacy coaches spent an average of two to three days per week in each school they served. In response to a request from the Mississippi Department of Education, the Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Southeast developed two tools to support the department: the Teacher Knowledge of Early Literacy Skills (TKELS) survey and the Coach's Classroom Observation Tool (CCOT). The Mississippi Department of Education invited all educators of students in kindergarten to grade 3 to complete the TKELS survey at four times between spring 2014 and fall 2015: spring 2014, fall 2014, spring 2015, and fall 2015. State literacy coaches observed classroom instruction in the target schools using the CCOT four times between winter 2014 and spring 2015: winter 2014, spring 2014, fall 2014, and spring 2015. The study team used the results to investigate changes in teacher knowledge and in ratings of quality of early literacy skills instruction, student engagement in early literacy instruction, and teaching competencies as well as the relationship between changes and educators' progress in the Language Essentials for Teaching Reading and Spelling professional development program. This study presents the results of a systematic investigation of change in educators' knowledge and classroom practices--the targeted areas for change associated with the professional development program that the Mississippi Department of Education used. The four main findings of the study were: (1) Between spring 2014 and fall 2015 average teacher knowledge of early literacy skills increased from 49.56 on the Teacher Knowledge of Early Literacy Skills survey to 52.28 (measured in T-score points, a standardized score with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10)--equivalent to answering at least one more item out of 31 correctly. This corresponded to an increase from the 48th percentile to the 59th; (2) The increase in teacher knowledge of early literacy skills was associated with progress in the professional development program. Educators who had completed the program scored an average of 2.90 points higher than did educators who had not started it. At the end of the study, educators who had not started the program were in the 54th percentile on the Teacher Knowledge of Early Literacy Skills survey, whereas educators who had completed it were in the 65th percentile; (3) Between winter 2014 and spring 2015 in target schools the average ratings of quality of early literacy skills instruction, student engagement during early literacy skills instruction, and teaching competencies increased. The average rating of quality of instruction increased from the 31st percentile to the 58th percentile, the average rating of student engagement increased from the 37th percentile to the 53rd percentile, and the average rating of teaching competencies increased from the 30th percentile to the 44th percentile; and (4) The increases in the average ratings of quality of instruction, student engagement, and teaching competencies in target schools were associated with progress in the professional development program. Teachers who had completed the program were rated 0.30 point higher in quality of instruction, 0.22 point higher in student engagement, and 0.41 point higher in teaching competencies than did teachers who had not started it. At the end of the study, teachers who had not started the program were rated in the 42nd percentile for quality of instruction, the 39th percentile for student engagement, and the 38th percentile for teaching competencies, whereas teachers who had completed the program were rated in the 59th percentile for quality of instruction, the 53rd percentile for student engagement, and the 54th percentile for teaching competencies. The findings suggest that during the period when the Language Essentials for Teaching Reading and Spelling professional development program was implemented, teacher knowledge of early literacy skills, the quality of early literacy skills instruction, student engagement during early literacy skills instruction, and teaching competencies improved among educators who participated in the program over and above any increases found among educators generally.

A new principal has brought a wave of optimism, test scores are way up, and middle-class families who used to avoid the school are enrolling their children. In Brooklyn, teenagers who might have dropped out of school are getting diplomas through a special evening program. In the Bronx, a small high school is graduating its low-income students at a faster clip than are New York City's larger, older high schools. Promising signs like these are some of what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is banking on as he seeks re-election November 8. Not long after taking office in 2001, the Republican businessman persuaded the New York state legislature to give him nearly unprecedented control of the biggest school district in the country. He invited voters to retain or replace him based on his work improving the schools. Of all the Bloomberg administration's changes, the new approach to instruction has drawn by far the sharpest and most prolonged criticism. Though the mayor suggested he would take a back-to-basics approach, his top deputies rejected the highly scripted model of &quot;managed instruction&quot; that's popular in cities with large numbers of children behind on their skills. Eliminating the dozens of curricula in use around the city, they chose a language arts program, Month by Month Phonics, that they say gives children both reading skills and plenty of practice with good books. Critics charge it is woefully short on systematic instruction in basic skills such as decoding. They also picked a strongly conceptual mathematics program, Everyday Math, that some see as shortchanging computational skills. The Bloomberg administration contends that this approach, spread citywide, is starting to pay off. On the 2005 state language arts tests, 59 percent of 4th graders scored at grade level, up 10 percentage points from the previous year. On the math tests, 77 percent of 4th graders scored at grade level, up 9 points in one year. Top aides acknowledge privately that poor test scores could have been disastrous for Mayor Bloomberg. And his critics are frustrated that good ones seem to have immunized him from criticism. Many still rue the administration's instructional choices, contending its literacy methods are about how to teach, not what to teach.", "subject": "Grade 4, Teaching Methods, Mathematics Tests, Criticism, Reading Skills, Language Arts, Evening Programs, Academic Achievement, Mathematics Instruction, Government School Relationship, City Government, High Stakes Tests, Politics of Education", "source": "Education Week", "publicationdateyear": 2005.0}, {"title": "Summary Writing as a Means to Improve the Second Language, the Mother Tongue, and Mental Organization", "author": "D'Acierno, Maria Rosaria", "description": "The general purpose of this study is to increase, in a classroom environment, formal communication by using reading and writing. Our research focuses on reading as a means to develop the writing of a good pr\u00e9cis, which in its turn contributes to improve: 1) memory, vocabulary and grammatical-syntactical structures, in brief, the organization of a correct paragraph in both the oral and the written language. The experiment includes the foreign as well as the students' first language, since it wants also to investigate the influence of one language on the other. Furthermore, it wants to enlarge the results concerning the great problem related to transfer; in other words if, in this limited area (reading and summary writing), it is the L1 which influences L2 or vice versa. Undoubtedly, the acquisition of the first and the foreign language follows two different processes, one based on spontaneous development, the other on systematic and sequentially instruction offered by a proper teacher. Another general statement refers to the influence of one's own mother tongue on the foreign language, just because the advantage knowledge of the first language and the previous experience attached to the meaning of its words lead the foreign language student to a simple translation of words without caring about their cultural implications. In so doing, the first language shows a deep influence on the foreign one, depriving words, linguistic expressions and gestures of their cultural side. The foreign language student automatically translates words and structures taking advantages of his/her previous experience, thus, depriving the foreign language of the inner sense coming from traditions and ways of life. For this reason it becomes essential to teach the cultural data of the foreign language studied in parallel with the formal aspect of the language. While talking about the different cultural meaning attached to words, a big parenthesis needs to be discussed, even though is not central to this study, mostly centred on a didactic situation. From the psychological point of view, a more difficult situation is attached to the meaning of words, when a connection is established between words and thoughts; when words refer to the speaker's personal experience, which in its turn reflects the social experience of the subject. As Sergio Piro writes in &quot;La scacchiera maledetta&quot; (a kind of trap, where every move is controlled, a research about mental illness), to communicate does not mean to use conventional words/signs, rather it means to use a series of unconventional spontaneous, immediate alternatives, which, through mediation, inevitably become conventional, even though they are subject to another changing according to the feeling of the speaker. Linguistic crystallization (sistema doxico -- monotetico; rozzezza del linguaggio convenzionale), as Piro calls the symbolic meaning attached to words, reflects the flow of social events, events which are totally different from the personal, internal happenings of the single subject. For this reason conventional words are not the best way to describe inner thoughts.", "subject": "Writing Skills, Native Language, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Memory, Vocabulary Development, Grammar, Syntax, Transfer of Training, Reading Writing Relationship, Teaching Methods, Writing Evaluation, Reading Comprehension, Oral Language, Generalization, Cultural Influences, Writing Processes, Psycholinguistics, Sociocultural Patterns, Learning Processes, Inner Speech (Subvocal)", "source": "Online Submission", "publicationdateyear": 2018.0}, {"title": "The Use of Classroom Walk-Through Observations as a Strategy to Improve Teaching and Learning: An Administrative Perspective", "author": "Weller, Mark J.", "description": "The purpose of this study was to identify the possible use of structured classroom walk-through observations as a strategy to improve teaching and learning. A wide variety of programs and initiatives have recently been implemented across the country to improve student achievement. One such initiative is classroom walk-through observations. Classroom walk-through observations are briefly performed by school administrators to gauge the effectiveness of instruction in each classroom. The walk-through observation gives teachers and administrators a snapshot of teaching and learning aspects throughout the school over time. This research was done collaboratively with Leslie McEntire and Tom Sorensen. The research team investigated three middle schools from one district in the Midwestern United States.    Over a two-year period of time, administrators from these schools performed 1,052 classroom walk-through observations. The data from these observations were collected and analyzed to determine potential relationships between the independent and dependent variables. The dependent variables were MAP scores in Communication Arts and Math, discipline referrals, summer school placement, and student retention at grade level. The independent variable was the ABC School District classroom observation data and results.    The findings of the study revealed a potential correlation in all areas analyzed. MAP scores in the area of Communication Arts and Math increased across the board, while discipline referrals, summer school placement, and retention decreased at all three middle schools during the time studied. However, these correlations were not statistically significant. Additional programs and practices that were implemented over the period of time studied were not factored into the study.    My differentiation to the study was to analyze the research and data from an administrative perspective. As an assistant principal, I have performed the classroom walk-through observations and used them as an instructional tool for teacher improvement. I attempted to determine the potential relationship between the independent variable and each dependent variable while also providing an improved and systematic approach to performing classroom walk-through observations. My research concluded that while classroom walk-through observations can help improve teaching practices and learner outcomes, there exists a limitation which is that many more factors than classroom walk-through observations may have contributed to significant academic gains.

With more than 1.3 million teachers in U.S. public schools, it is impossible to estimate the extent to which the instructional practices described in this chapter are widespread or rare. Given the pressures on educators generated by state testing, differential access to technology, and other significant obstacles, it is reasonable to assume that only a small proportion of American students receive any systematic application of media literacy concepts within the context of subject area instruction. Many factors may lead a teacher to begin incorporating media analysis and media production activities into the curriculum. The differences in motivations lie at the heart of some of the arguments and debates that have characterized the media literacy movement's growth and development in the 1990s. Is the diversity of perspectives now in place among content-area practitioners a source of strength and vitality, or has it polarized and paralyzed the development of the field? To address this question, this chapter reviews ongoing educational initiatives in media literacy documented in the emerging body of case study and practitioner literature and identifies those (few) empirical studies that have measured the effects of media literacy instruction on students' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, with particular focus on health education, social studies, English language arts, communication arts, and the fine and performing arts.

In the spring of 2020, the WMCC gathered information about districts' and individuals' experiences with distance learning by conducting focus groups with a variety of stakeholders (a total of 25 sessions with 153 participants) and completing a systematic review of a sample of over 250 district distance learning plans from across the state. Information from these sources, as well as a wealth of information from educators collected through the University of Minnesota's Spring 2020 Minnesota PK-12 Distance Learning Survey, was used to inform the WMCC's decision to develop a statewide survey to gather longitudinal feedback regarding the state's Safe Learning Plan amid the continued navigation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The WMCC developed the Minnesota Safe Learning Survey to examine educators', students' (grades 6-12), and families' educational experiences during the first half of the 2020-21 academic year. The purpose of this survey was to get a true picture of how those being most impacted by the Safe Learning Plan are experiencing it. The survey will be deployed at three intervals, February, May, and October 2021, with statewide reports following the conclusion of each survey window. This is the first of three reports that will be produced.

The reading of these articles has risen new elements that work as language activators in the language classroom: critical reading and thinking have developed participation in the oral activities and produced a noticeable influence on their scientific and humanist thinking and behavior. From this, we may extract the consequence that the experience is not only related to scientific knowledge, since it has made them better speakers or speaking-counterparts and more class-participating and collaborative, which implies that the human, scientific and linguistic factors progress at the same time through the critical experience. This way, the exposition of their critical ideas has developed both their humanism and scientific mind. These two facets which seem to belong to far away fields become a bond in our experience: the process is scientific since it tries to be a systematic study of the knowledge fleshed in written texts and it is also humanist because it fulfills the students need to grow up as persons, that is absorbing knowledge and processing it in order to produce a new personal approach to the world.", "subject": "Reading Instruction, Critical Reading, English (Second Language), Educational Practices, Critical Thinking, Oral Reading, Classroom Techniques, Teaching Methods, Classroom Communication, Student Experience, Learner Engagement, Journal Articles, Student Participation, Simulation, Student Attitudes, Instructional Effectiveness, Scientific and Technical Information", "source": "Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education", "publicationdateyear": 2012.0}, {"title": "Americanization as a War Measure: Report of a Conference Called by the Secretary of the Interior, and Held in Washington, April 3, 1918.

On February 12, 1918, the Council of National Defense, at the request of the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior, sent to the State councils advance sheets of one of its bulletins, asking them to appoint a committee on Americanization, to perform two important functions: First, to assist the United States Bureau of Education in carrying out its national program.

However, many argue these instruments can also be used to effect change in classroom practice. This study investigates a model of professional development (PD) built around a tool--the Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations (PLATO). Purpose/Objective: The study analyzes the extent to which teachers appropriated the instructional practices targeted in the PLATO PD. We also assess factors that may have supported and/or hindered teachers' uptake of practices. Setting/Participants: The study sample includes 27 teachers who participated in PD over 2 years. Teachers worked in six middle schools in a single, large urban district. Intervention: The two year PD consisted of 5 daylong sessions each school year, and a 4-day summer institute. All sessions focused on the PLATO scales. Teachers also worked in school-based teams to design lessons featuring the focal practices and attended five school-site meetings with PLATO PD providers. Research Design and Data Collection: PLATO served as a set of practices around which to orient PD, as well as a standardized tool for measuring changes in teacher practice. All teachers were observed using PLATO scales throughout the PD and during the subsequent year. We conducted multiple interviews with all participating teachers, which were transcribed and coded by multiple researchers. Case studies of six purposively sampled teachers incorporate interviews, scores, and field notes. Findings/Results: The duration of PD mattered in terms of teachers' appropriation of PLATO practices. In addition, &quot;foundational practices&quot; supported the appropriation of more ambitious practices targeted in the PLATO PD, including time and behavior management and instructional planning. Finally, our findings suggest stable and collaborative communities support professional learning and growth. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings suggest moving away from &quot;one size fits all models&quot; and differentiating PD for teachers. Effective professional development may not be effective for all teachers. Observation protocols can play a unique role in PD by allowing professional developers to gather standardized information across teachers and to compare changes in teacher practice in systematic ways. PD providers might also use such tools diagnostically to identify and respond to the heterogeneity in teachers' practice.", "subject": "Teacher Evaluation, Classroom Observation Techniques, Instructional Improvement, Models, Faculty Development, Language Arts, Educational Practices, Adoption (Ideas), Middle School Teachers, Urban Schools, Interviews, Case Studies, Scores, Time Management, Self Management, Individualized Instruction", "source": "Teachers College Record", "publicationdateyear": 2016.0}, {"title": "Literacy Footprints Guided Reading System: Effects on Grade 3 English Language Arts Assessment Performance", "author": "Rentz, Bradley, Merth, Robert, Dey, Darienne", "description": "Pioneer Valley Books (PVB) contracted McREL International to investigate the effects of the third grade Literacy Footprints (LFP) guided reading system on English language arts (ELA) performance on state assessments.

McREL researchers conducted a matched pair cluster randomized control trial to investigate LFP's possible effects on student achievement. The trial, conducted during the 2021/22 school year, included a sample of 3,071 students in 29 public elementary schools in a large suburban Florida school district. The district purchased LFP kits for grade 3 teachers in 14 elementary schools (SY2021/22) that were randomly assigned to the treatment group. Treatment teachers also obtained access to the Digital Reader and received virtual training and follow-up support to implement materials with students. Business-as-usual (BAU) instruction occurred at 15 schools (the control group). After the trial was completed, control group schools received the kits in the 2022/23 school year with access to the Digital Reader. Using a design-based estimator that accounts for both school-level clustering and school-matched pairs, the study found a statistically significant difference in the average English language arts standardized tests scores between treatment and control groups.

These key concepts of &quot;value,&quot; &quot;flow,&quot; and &quot;pull,&quot; align with the ultimate lean goal: &quot;perfection,&quot; or a continuous striving for improvement in the performance of the organization. Through applying a lean methodology to the teaching processes, additionally the teachers can eliminate reasons that do not add value and are thus wasteful, and they can focus their efforts on the advancement of teaching and learning. By applying the lean principles and techniques developed in the industry, educators can refine the content, pedagogy, organization, and assessment methods employed in their accounting courses to help and ensure that students gain the knowledge and skills that will make them most desirable to students. Lean can be taught throughout several methods and tools, such as readings and class discussion, game- and simulation-based methods, and the open forum method. The readings and discussion method present students with the opportunity, and even the obligation, to express their Point of view on certain issues, requiring the students to think critically on the subject and use logic to evaluate others' positions through open and active participation. When applying lean production to learning, we should first identify the process and then maintain focus on what adds value (i.e., student improvements), empower students to do CI (continuous improvement), eliminate what does not add value through Kaizen (brainstorm alternatives and identify a hypothesis to test), conduct PDCA (develop an experimental plan, carry out the plan or do it and then check for results and adjust accordingly), and make a team work to support and share with each other. To apply lean thinking and to create a lean culture classroom, the classroom should first be organized; thereafter, visual sheets should be managed, pre-planning must be done, take-time should be established, and work should be standardized by creating syllabi and schedules and associated materials. Other classroom tools must be available as well, such as Pareto charts, root cause, and weekly quality assessments. To fulfill this objective, a research question has been approved as a data collection instrument in this descriptive study, a 35 item questionnaire was administered to English preparatory school student at Duhok city and an interview was conducted with twelve students with different levels in Sabis International School. In addition, the descriptive statistics indicated that the male learners employed language learning strategies more frequently (average=3.3) than the female learners (average=3.2) One can conclude that male students use lean learning strategies more than female student do.

Besides, all the values in the regression model come out to support the view that gender is effective in the use of learning the lean method. The result also indicates that the duration of taking English does not significantly effect on learning and using lean learning strategies as it reveals in ANOVA analysis.

The goal was to balance the practical and logistical challenges of identifying, teaching, and learning academic and content vocabulary with the opportunities posed by web-based visualization technologies. They involved teachers early on in this development process, and through a series of co-developer meetings with a panel of science teachers in the San Francisco Unified School District, endeavored to create a truly teacher-centric instructional tool. They also confronted the realities of the urban school setting, where resources are often a challenge and teachers vary in their experience and comfort level with classroom technology. The result was &quot;WordSift&quot;, a web-based interface that creates a visual, interactive representation of selected text. Based on any English text entered into a &quot;copy and paste&quot; box, &quot;WordSift&quot; rapidly returns a visual display--or Tag Cloud-- that displays the top 50 words in alphabetical order, with the relative frequency of each word indicated by text size. Through regular meetings with their panel of teacher collaborators, a number of potential uses of &quot;WordSift&quot; were identified as useful to support instruction for teachers and reading comprehension for students. These included lesson preparation, the development of group activities for teachers, and the ability to preview text and access additional literacy support for students. &quot;WordSift&quot; was launched to the public on January 15, 2009. Usage statistics and teacher reviews of &quot;WordSift&quot; are discussed briefly in Section II. In addition to developing &quot;WordSift&quot; and looking at how it could be applied in the classroom, their effort also extended to the development of research to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;WordSift&quot; on student reading comprehension of science text. In the spring of 2010, they implemented a systematic study with the science co-developers to see whether previewing a science text with &quot;WordSift&quot; would improve the reading comprehension of their students relative to when they previewed text by other means. Early results suggest that the variation observed in reading comprehension assessment scores was not significantly related to differences based on exposure to &quot;WordSift&quot;, but rather to differences among characteristics of the students and the classes and schools in which they are enrolled. Interestingly, gender appeared to significantly mediate the treatment effect, resulting in a significant negative treatment effect for girls and a slightly positive (though not significant) treatment effect for boys. For future iterations of the web-based vocabulary tool, they may choose to pilot test it specifically with girls to get their feedback about design and features that appeal to them.

The concepts of differentiation and integration are important tools for solving real world problems. Using calculus or any mathematical tool in physics is much more complex than the straightforward application of the equations and algorithms that students often encounter in math classes. Research in physics education has reported students' lack of ability to transfer their calculus knowledge to physics problem solving. In the past, studies often focused on what students fail to do with less focus on their underlying cognition. However, when solving physics problems requiring the use of integration, their reasoning about mathematics and physics concepts has not yet been carefully and systematically studied. Hence the main purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate student thinking in-depth and provide deeper insights into student reasoning in physics problem solving from multiple perspectives. I propose a conceptual framework by integrating aspects of several theoretical constructs from the literature to help us understand our observations of student work as they solve physics problems that require the use of integration. I combined elements of three important theoretical constructs: mathematical resources or symbolic forms, which are the small pieces of knowledge elements associated with students' use of mathematical ideas; conceptual metaphors, which describe the systematic mapping of knowledge across multiple conceptual domains--typically from concrete source domain to abstract target domain; and conceptual blending, which describes the construction of new learning by integrating knowledge in different mental spaces. I collected data from group teaching/learning interviews as students solved physics problems requiring setting up integrals. Participants were recruited from a second-semester calculus-based physics course. I conducted qualitative analysis of the videotaped student conversations and their written work. The main contributions of this research include (1) providing evidence for the existence of symbolic forms in students' reasoning about differentials and integrals, (2) identifying conceptual metaphors involved in student reasoning about differentials and integrals, (3) categorizing the different ways in which students integrate their mathematics and physics knowledge in the context of solving physics integration problems, (4) exploring the use of hypothetical debate problems in shifting students' framing of physics problem solving requiring mathematics.

It draws upon a survey conducted by the European University Association between October and December 2013. 249 answers from higher education institutions, in their majority universities, from 38 European systems (European Union and wider Europe), were received. While the sample is self-selected, it represents almost one third of European Union Association's (EUA's) institutional membership. The survey asked about the type of e-learning institutions use, their experiences in this area and their expectations for the future. It considered blended and online learning in various formats. Given the strong interest in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a large section of the report is dedicated to this issue. The survey also posed questions regarding support structures and services, intra-institutional coordination, quality assurance and recognition. The results of the survey show that practically all higher education institutions of the sample have started to embrace e-learning. Most of the surveyed institutions are using blended learning (91%), integrating e-learning into conventional teaching, but surprisingly 82% of institutions also indicate that they offer online learning courses. Less frequent, but seemingly also on the rise, are other forms of provision such as joint inter-institutional collaboration and online degree courses. Online examinations are likely to become more widely used for all students in all or most disciplines, also for conventionally taught courses. Besides pedagogical and economic motives, the institutions refer to a growing need for flexibility of time and place, and better use of resources, benefiting both residential students and a wider range of professional and other lifelong learners.

A Scientific Synthesis of Early Literacy Development and Implications for Intervention", "author": null, "description": "The National Early Literacy Panel (NELP) was appointed in 2002 and carried out its work under the auspices of the National Center for Family Literacy (NCFL). NELP's primary goal was to identify interventions, parenting activities, and instructional practices that promote the development of children's early literacy skills. The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) funded the panel's work in consultation with the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the U.S. Department of Education, and the Office of Head Start in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This Panel report represents a systematic synthesis of the published research literature concerning children's early literacy skills. It provides educators and policymakers with information about early skills that are implicated in later literacy learning, and information about the type of instruction that can enhance these skills. The results also identify areas in which additional research is needed. The meta-analyses conducted by the panel showed that a wide range of interventions had a positive impact on children's early literacy learning. However, it is felt these positive results were due to the nature and intensity of the instructional activities examined in the studies, many of which differ from those typically seen in early childhood classrooms. These interventions were usually delivered as one-on-one or small-group activities, they occurred frequently, and they were adult-directed by researchers or their agents. Few interpretable studies evaluated the effects of merely providing a literacy-rich or language-rich classroom environment. The report calls for additional translational research, and examinations of typical implementations of such programs within early childhood education. Problems were also identified with the quality of much of the currently-available research. Many studies used simple pretest-posttest designs, which provide no causally interpretable evidence, and studies often did not provide evidence that these groups were equivalent prior to an intervention or represented the same population. The panel felt unable to rely on the data drawn from such studies, and excluded such from all of the analyses reported. Building a larger and more comprehensive knowledge base concerning early literacy skill development and promotion will require more high-quality research.

The Learning Passport is a response to the international crisis in education quality and learning outcomes. The project's specific aim is to improve the quality of education for children who, for whatever reason, are unable to access national education systems satisfactorily, either temporarily or permanently. The goal is to make possible stable and effective learning pathways for these children despite the instabilities they experience; this includes helping them to enter or return smoothly into national systems. The project's hypothesis is that quality can be improved by making available, as a global public good, an education model for basic education for children whose education has been disrupted. This education model is the Learning Passport. The purpose of this Report, with reference to the proposed education model, is first to anchor the project in the available evidence for quality education, as well as the evidence for quality in Education in Emergencies (EiE). Second, it is to make recommendations for how the Learning Passport should be taken forward or rethought, based on the evidence where possible. A major consideration for the Report has been the unusual nature of EiE as a field of research. A wide variety of different sources are examined in the review, reflecting the range of organisations and stakeholders involved in EiE, the relative youth and interdisciplinarity of the academic field of EiE, and the paucity of in-depth reporting on the practice, methodology and efficacy of specific EiE interventions. As a general rule, detailed accounts and systematic analyses of curricula and their effects, failures and successes in EiE contexts are sparse, and conclusions often have to be drawn from fragmented or anecdotal evidence. This situation is certainly partly explained by the fact that crises can be quick to develop, and frequently lack the data collection infrastructure necessary for rigorous monitoring and evaluation. In spite of the relative absence of evidence, however, a great deal of effort has been put into establishing the criteria and scope for what might constitute successful EiE efforts, spearheaded by the minimum standards created by the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE), founded in 2000. Activity in this arena continues to grow, with more substantial records of what does and does not work beginning to inform new projects. The research included in the Report, and summarised in this document, aims to reflect both the limitations and strengths of this evidence base.

The purposes of this study were to (a) assess the relationship between the cognitive processes of reading-based decision making and meaningful learning and (b) assess the degree to which a five week instructional intervention in the cognitive processes of reading-based decision making training affected student learning. A cognitive view of reading-based decision making (Sternberg, 1985), discourse processing (van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995 ), and meaningful learning (Ausubel, 1978; Hartley, 1987; Schumacher, 1987; Sternberg, 1985; Mayer, 1987) will provide the theoretical base and support for the instructional intervention used in this study. Methodology included an experimental quasi-random pre-test/post-test control group design (Shavelson, 1996). This design was employed to assess the degree to which training in the cognitive strategies of reading-based decision making behavior, such as the cognitive processes of meaningful learning strategies and the cognitive processes of reading- based decision making, improves the level of cognition and meaningful learning of underprepared college students. Data collection occurred during the first and final sessions of class with the meaningful learning test administered before the reading-based decision making questionnaire in both sessions. A Two Way Classification Table was be used in order to group students as either low readers or high readers and to organize the pre and post test data. A cause-effect relationship was hypothesized because the study stipulated that instruction in the cognitive processes of decision making would produce, bring about, or cause improved meaningful learning scores. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the means of the groups in order to decide whether the observed differences between them represent a chance occurrence or a systematic effect. A general linear model analysis was used in order to compare the means of reading ability between the experimental and control groups.    The results of the research indicated that, statistically, there is not a significant difference when subjects were instructed in reading-based decision making strategies. Given some of the structural limitations of this study, further research in this important area is still warranted. On the basis of what was learned in this study, more research should be done to examine the relationship between reading-based decision making behavior and meaningful learning. When additional research is conducted, the intervention should be tied to a specific content area course and impact should be examined, both short term and long term. Some specific issues that should be examined are: (a) what is the role of homework logs; (b) would this approach work equally well for English Language Learners as for native English speakers who are weak readers; and (c) what kinds of training are needed by faculty to embed this approach in their teaching. Another area in need of further research is to examine the reading-based issues facing college students today, especially the least prepared college students, and how higher education institutions can best address these critical literacy issues.
