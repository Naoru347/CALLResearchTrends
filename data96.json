[{"id":"EJ1080885","title":"Spoken Grammar Practice and Feedback in an ASR-Based CALL System","author":"de Vries, Bart Penning, Cucchiarini, Catia, Bodnar, Stephen, Strik, Helmer, van Hout, Roeland","description":"Speaking practice is important for learners of a second language. Computer assisted language learning (CALL) systems can provide attractive opportunities for speaking practice when combined with automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. In this paper, we present a CALL system that offers spoken practice of word order, an important aspect of Dutch grammar. The system uses ASR technology to process the learner's responses and to detect errors so that immediate corrective feedback (CF) can be provided on learner errors. We evaluate the system as a learning environment by analyzing proficiency gains in pre- and post-tests, the logs of the practice sessions, and the learners' appreciation of the system. In this paper, we present two learning conditions: (1) the learners received oral practice and immediate CF on spoken performance and (2) learners received oral practice and NO CF on spoken performance. We found that our system was successful in providing L2 speaking practice. Results show that both groups improve their proficiency on the target feature as a result of treatment. Between the groups there is no significant difference in learning, but the groups proceeded differently through the sessions, and the learners in the group that received automatic CF evaluated the system more positively than the NO CF group. We discuss the performance of the system as an environment for language learning and the obtained proficiency test results, and relate them to current views on second language acquisition.","subject":"Grammar, Computer Assisted Instruction, Feedback (Response), Error Correction, Language Proficiency, Pretests Posttests, Oral Language, Second Language Learning, Indo European Languages, Second Language Instruction, Language Tests, Task Analysis, Adult Students, Video Technology, Foreign Countries, Likert Scales, Questionnaires","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Netherlands"},{"id":"EJ1077721","title":"A Virtual Walk through London: Culture Learning through a Cultural Immersion Experience","author":"Shih, Ya-Chun","description":"Integrating Google Street View into a three-dimensional virtual environment in which users control personal avatars provides these said users with access to an innovative, interactive, and real-world context for communication and culture learning. We have selected London, a city famous for its rich historical, architectural, and artistic heritage, as the location of choice for culture learning. Using avatars, learners walk the virtual streets of London under the guidance of a native English-speaking instructor, and interact with each other using text and voice chat functions. The study examines the effects of this virtual environment on culture learning. Specifically, a qualitative case study combined with a time-series design is used to investigate the virtual context's impact on culture learning in terms of learner knowledge and attitudes, and to track associated change processes across the three research phases (baseline, treatment, and maintenance). The results show that all four English learners involved in the study benefitted from their cultural immersion, to varying extents, in the virtual environment. Four contributing learner factors, namely linguistic proficiency, motivation, character traits, and attitudes were found to correspond to the learners' levels of acquaintance with the target culture.","subject":"Geographic Information Systems, Case Studies, Qualitative Research, Language Proficiency, Computer Simulation, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Learning Motivation, Personality Traits, Student Attitudes, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Native Speakers, Computer Mediated Communication, Cultural Education, Teaching Methods, Graduate Students, Multiple Choice Tests, Identification, Pictorial Stimuli, Student Evaluation, Statistical Analysis, Test Validity, Observation","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan, United Kingdom (London)"},{"id":"EJ1077787","title":"Design Considerations of Help Options in Computer-Based L2 Listening Materials Informed by Participatory Design","author":"C\u00e1rdenas-Claros, M\u00f3nica Stella","description":"This paper reports on the findings of two qualitative exploratory studies that sought to investigate design features of help options in computer-based L2 listening materials. Informed by principles of participatory design, language learners, software designers, language teachers, and a computer programmer worked collaboratively in a series of design sessions. The participants first evaluated researcher-generated prototypes, designed prototypes for two language proficiencies (beginner and upper intermediate) and iterated designs on both paper and screen. Analysis of the reworked prototypes resulted in five features of help option design: type, location, sequence, click-through, and display. Analyses of the interaction data showed that consensually the participants favored help options that are easy to use, promote learner control, support guidance, and stimulate learning.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Qualitative Research, Listening Skills, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Instructional Materials, Language Teachers, Programming, Language Proficiency, Material Development, Usability, Interaction, Foreign Countries","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1063571","title":"Computer-Based Grammar Instruction in an EFL Context: Improving the Effectiveness of Teaching Adverbial Clauses","author":"Kili\u00e7kaya, Ferit","description":"This study aims to find out whether there are any statistically significant differences in participants' achievements on three different types of instruction: computer-based instruction, teacher-driven instruction, and teacher-driven grammar supported by computer-based instruction. Each type of instruction follows the deductive approach. The sample of the study consists of 50 learners of English enrolled in a preparatory course for a high-stake language exam conducted in Turkey. The effectiveness is compared based on the results obtained from the post-test and the delayed post-test, which is conducted five weeks later. The participants instructed by using both computer-based and teacher-driven grammar instruction supported by computer-based materials score higher than those who receive traditional instruction. Moreover, supporting teacher-driven instruction with computer-based materials in learning adverbial clauses can lead to higher achievement through taking practice beyond the classroom.","subject":"Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Grammar, English (Second Language), Teaching Methods, High Stakes Tests, Foreign Countries, Scores, Conventional Instruction, Form Classes (Languages), Phrase Structure, Academic Achievement, Instructional Effectiveness, Language Tests, Experimental Groups, Courseware, Instructional Materials, Pretests Posttests, Language Proficiency, Employment Qualifications","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Turkey"},{"id":"EJ1051437","title":"From Web-Based Readers to Voice Bloggers: EFL Learners' Perspectives","author":"Huang, Hsin-chou","description":"With the advancement of such Web 2.0 applications as weblogs, language learners have more opportunities to use a target language for communication purposes and to experience peer collaboration and interaction. In the search for ways to augment an EFL curriculum in which speaking practice is limited but the demand for improving oral proficiencies is high, this study explored the use of voice blogging to develop communication skills, analyzed the stages of students' blogging efforts, and investigated students' perceptions of this authentic language experience. Seventy-four intermediate EFL learners from two Freshman English classes at a national university in Taiwan participated in this study. During the semester-long experiment, students read online materials and used an instructional blogging site constructed by the teacher-researcher to post voice blog entries and comment on peers' blog posts. The recursive four stages of their blogging efforts were: reading to learn, planning and organizing, speaking, and sharing. In a post-task survey and in semi-structured interviews, students said they felt that the process of producing voice blog entries facilitated language learning, enhanced knowledge construction, and promoted social networking. Students also offered suggestions for ways to improve the project, such as teaching more online search skills, providing better online recording mechanisms, and setting up a combination of face-to-face and online interactions. This study's findings and suggestions for future voice blogging projects can serve as a template for integrating voice blogging into the EFL curriculum.","subject":"Web 2.0 Technologies, Semi Structured Interviews, Electronic Publishing, English (Second Language), Second Language Learning, Surveys, Foreign Countries, College Freshmen, Language Proficiency, Oral Language, Computer Mediated Communication, Language Processing, Student Attitudes, Social Networks, Search Strategies, Second Language Instruction, Teaching Methods, Computer Assisted Instruction, Web Sites, Feedback (Response)","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Taiwan"},{"id":"EJ1059285","title":"Interactions between Text Chat and Audio Modalities for L2 Communication and Feedback in the Synthetic World &quot;Second Life&quot;","author":"Wigham, Ciara R., Chanier, Thierry","description":"This paper reports on a study of the interactions between text chat and audio modalities in L2 communication in a synthetic (virtual) world and observes whether the text chat modality was used for corrective feedback and the characteristics of the latter. This is examined within the context of a hybrid content and language integrated learning design workshop. This course involved 17 students of architecture whose L2 was either French or English and for which the synthetic world environment Second Life was employed for distance language sessions. Using multimodal transcriptions of the interaction data from these sessions, it was found that text chat was employed for content-based interaction concerning the task as well as for feedback concerning non-target-like errors in the audio modality. Feedback predominantly concerned lexical errors and was offered in the form of recasts. The multimodality of the environment did not appear to cognitively overload students who frequently responded in the audio modality to corrective feedback offered in the text chat. The study highlights the need to train language tutors who wish to exploit synthetic worlds to use the text chat in parallel with the audio to support learners' verbal production with respect to verbal participation and proficiency.","subject":"Computer Simulation, Social Systems, Internet, Computer Mediated Communication, Handheld Devices, Written Language, Telecommunications, Second Language Instruction, Auditory Stimuli, English, French, Nonverbal Communication, Feedback (Response), Discourse Analysis, Interaction, Interaction Process Analysis, Electronic Learning, Undergraduate Students, Architectural Education","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
