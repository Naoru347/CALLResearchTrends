[{"id":"EJ1059671","title":"Language Learner Perspectives on the Functionality and Use of Electronic Language Dictionaries","author":"Levy, Mike, Steel, Caroline","description":"This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of &quot;usability&quot; and &quot;functionality,&quot; these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n = 587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel &amp; Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students' comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.","subject":"Second Language Learning, Second Language Instruction, Foreign Countries, Dictionaries, Electronic Publishing, Surveys, Student Attitudes, Language Enrollment, Usability, College Students, Statistical Analysis, Qualitative Research, Telecommunications, Classification","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Australia"},{"id":"EJ1074883","title":"Attitudes towards Online Feedback on Writing: Why Students Mistrust the Learning Potential of Models","author":"Strobl, Carola","description":"This exploratory study sheds new light on students' perceptions of online feedback types for a complex writing task, summary writing from spoken input in a foreign language (L2), and investigates how these correlate with their actual learning to write. Students tend to favour clear-cut, instructivist rather than constructivist feedback, and guided self-evaluation through model solutions in online learning environments. However, the former type is too limited to tackle all dimensions of advanced writing. Constructivist feedback, in the form of guided modelling, allows addressing the higher-order concerns involved in summary writing. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that activating the zone of proximal development (ZPD) through cognitive involvement is beneficial to learning. To investigate students' learning from both types of feedback, a one-group pre-post-test intervention study was set up. Students attending a course on summary writing in L2 within a bachelor programme in Applied Languages (n = 38) followed an individual online learning module containing both instructivist fill-the-gap exercises and model solutions with constructivist guiding questions for self-assessment. The students' actual learning gain was measured through pre- and post-tests, and compared with their perceived learning gain, as expressed in self-evaluation. The comparison reveals a dichotomy between the students' observed learning curve and an underestimation of their own progress. This dichotomy was found to originate in a mismatch between their expectations towards the online learning module and the characteristics of the constructivist feedback conveyed. This mismatch can be attributed to three key factors: (1) evaluation, (2) linguistic focus, and (3) learner motivation.","subject":"Feedback (Response), Writing (Composition), Constructivism (Learning), Computer Mediated Communication, Student Attitudes, Writing Attitudes, Second Language Learning, Correlation, Writing Instruction, Trust (Psychology), Models, Undergraduate Students, Bachelors Degrees, Applied Linguistics, Problem Solving, Ability, Cognitive Development, Educational Benefits, Pretests Posttests, Intervention, Electronic Learning, Learning Modules, Writing Exercises, Self Evaluation (Individuals), Comparative Analysis, Learning Motivation, Blended Learning","source":"ReCALL","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
