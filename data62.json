[{"id":"EJ1051670","title":"Supporting In-Service Language Educators in Learning to Telecollaborate","author":"O'Dowd, Robert","description":"The importance of teachers' capacity to integrate and exploit computer mediated communication (CMC) in the foreign language classroom has been recognised by many of the leading publications in foreign language teacher education, including the European Profile for Language Teacher Education (2004) and the European portfolio for student teachers of foreign languages (EPOSTL) (2007). One of the essential CMC activities in foreign language education is undoubtedly telecollaboration. This is the application of online communication tools to connect classes of language learners in geographically distant locations with the aim of developing their foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative tasks and project work (O'Dowd, 2007). This paper begins by presenting a model of competences for the telecollaborative teacher, which has been developed and verified by this author (2013) using the Delphi technique. The paper then presents UNICollaboration (www.unicollaboration.eu), an online platform, which has been developed reflecting these competences and a sociocultural approach to teacher education. Following that, the findings of four qualitative case studies of novice telecollaborators are used to inform the design of tools and training courses for educators in this complex activity of online foreign language education.","subject":"Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Language Teachers, Computer Assisted Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Competencies, Delphi Technique, Teacher Education, Case Studies, Cooperative Learning, Technological Literacy, Teacher Attitudes, College Faculty, Interviews, Foreign Countries","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Argentina, California, Italy"},{"id":"EJ1063777","title":"A Meta-Synthesis of Empirical Research on the Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) in SLA","author":"Lin, Huifen","description":"This meta-analysis reports the results of a systematic synthesis of primary studies on the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in second language acquisition (SLA) for the period 2000-2012. By extracting information on 21 features from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for instructional\/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger groups or no grouping.

One of the byproducts of this new environment is the growth in opportunity for language learning, in particular through informal environments such as social networks and networked gaming. The challenges for training language teachers to deal with this dynamic are considerable. They will need to be able to follow new developments in technology and be able to understand their potential use in second language instruction. In this column, Robert Godwin-Jones, examines the interconnected roles that L2 (second language) teachers may need to play in order to be effective in a changing social, educational, and technological environment.","subject":"Language Teachers, Teacher Role, Computer Networks, Global Approach, Social Networks, Second Language Learning, Computer Games, Programming, Technology Uses in Education, Computer Assisted Instruction, Second Language Instruction, Educational Technology","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null},{"id":"EJ1075822","title":"Contributing, Creating, Curating: Digital Literacies for Language Learners","author":"Godwin-Jones, Robert","description":"In today's globalized, connected world, fixed and stable identities are increasingly uncommon. The means and modes of online communication and engagement, themselves powerful contributors to identity formation, are likewise in a constant state of flux. Participating in emerging online communities may require users to develop new skills, acquire specific software or hardware, and\/or learn particular conventions and behavior norms. In this column we will be looking at what that dynamic entails and what impact the ongoing need for new literacies and competencies has on language learning, both in formal instruction and in out-of-school environments. We will be looking at ways in which learners achieve language and literacy gains through participation in online communal spaces and how such activities relate to formal language instruction. Engaging with Internet-based communities is likely to involve the ability to interact with and to create or remix materials and resources in a variety of media and from a variety of sources. In addition to focused or incidental language learning through roles played in participatory Internet communities we will also look at the need for language learners to develop competence in searching out, evaluating, and collecting online materials, tools, and services. This includes the guiding role language teachers can play in the process. As language teachers, our ultimate goal is to enable and encourage our students to gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation to become autonomous language learners and culturally responsible participants in local and online communities. Capability in a full range of digital literacies is key to that process and vital today in education, personal life, and work environments: The growing importance of online technologies for the ways in which we work and learn in global networks has meant that today, instead of using technology simply to learn FLs [foreign languages], learners need to learn how to combine both FL skills and &quot;e-skills&quot; or &quot;new literacies&quot; to be able to work and collaborate in new contexts where the borders between the visual and the real and between the distant and the proximate are increasingly blurred (Dooly &amp; O'Dowd, 2012, p. 15). That blurring of boundaries among literacies, genres, and modes of representation is what makes this topic intriguing and challenging.","subject":"Technological Literacy, Second Language Learning, Incidental Learning, Skill Development, Communities of Practice, Literacy, Second Language Instruction, Computer Mediated Communication, Teacher Role, Language Teachers, Learning Motivation, Personal Autonomy, Cultural Awareness, Work Environment, Information Literacy","source":"Language Learning & Technology","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":null}]
