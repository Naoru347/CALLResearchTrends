Since knowledge of collocations is essential for appropriate and fluent use of language, learning collocations should have a central place in the study of vocabulary. There are different opinions about the best ways of learning collocations. This study investigates the effectiveness of corpus-based activities for learning verb-adverb collocations compared to traditional activities usually found in course books. The test results show that the participants who learned the collocations with the help of the online concordancer gained more knowledge and had better results in all parts of the test.","subject":"Computational Linguistics, Phrase Structure, Verbs, Form Classes (Languages), Teaching Methods, Indexes, Language Tests, Language Fluency, Instructional Effectiveness, Foreign Countries, Undergraduate Students, Second Language Instruction, Second Language Learning, Experimental Groups, Pretests Posttests, Control Groups","source":"Computer Assisted Language Learning","publicationdateyear":2015,"identifiersgeo":"Macedonia"}]
